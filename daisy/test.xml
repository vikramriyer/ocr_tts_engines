<p>
 The utterance demography was employed for the first time by A.Guillard, a
Frenchman, in his book Elements de Statistique Humanine. It is a statistical
analysis of population composition, distribution and leanings. It is the learn-
ing of population Variables which comprises of store and pour. The national
census is the basis of reserve variable which is carried out every so often in
most of the countries. It is the common saying that the ﬂow variables are
the constituents of population change which consist of birth and death reg-
istrations. Demography can be a very common science that can be applied
to any kind of dynamic human population. It encompasses the study of the
size, structure and distribution of these populations, and spatial and tem-
poral changes in them in response to birth, migration, ageing and death.
Demographic analysis is applied to whole societies or to groups defined by
variables such as education, nationality, religion and ethnicity. </p>
<p>
  PopulatiOn is at the heart of development, and population trends are a
key constituent of the context in which development takes place. As a result,
population policies are directed towards influencing demOgraphic behaV-
iour and population dynamics. The goal of the meeting was to emphasize
the contribution of population policy in achieving the internationally agreed
development goals. Population issues are vital to understand the envirOn-
ment and its consequences. Population blast leads to social problems like
unemployment, poverty, low economic development and Other social and
economic evils. The social development Which is determined by better
health care facilities, education and high literacy rate, and improvement in
the standards and lifestyle of people are unfavourably affected due to high
population. The marginalized and the weaker sections of the population do
not get the share of the development. In global discourses and modelling
workout, the impact of population on greenhouse gas emission has often
been discussed simplistically. Efforts to give power to women improve social
conditions, ensure universal access to reproductive health, including volun-
tary family planning, would help to reduce fertility and contribute to even-
tual population stabilization. </p>
<p>
For an unbiased social development, government should aim not only at
controlling the unregulated human growth of numerical Strength, but also at
checking the unregulated movement of the population and increasing con-
centration of people in the urbanized areas and providing adequate living

space and other facilities (www.sociologyguide.com). These goals have to
be jointly linked with the formulation and execution of policies aimed at
population parameter and setting up for binding both natural and human
resources. Thus, only population growth per se may not be perceived as a
prime problem but its relation with the accessibility of resources may be
viewed with great concern. In this book, the parameters of social demog—
raphy has been neatly defined to include the relationship of population to
society, the principles of population, social institutions, social factors that
influence population change, social change, population policy, and popula-
tion problems and solutions.

<p>
An Introduction to Social Demography is a foundation text on Indian
demography that provides students with a balanced picture of population
dynamics. Each chapter identifies and explores basic issues and concerns of
population science within the discipline with its all possible lucidity avoid-
ing jargons. Highly technical matters are kept to the bare essentials while an
emphasis is placed on conceptual and theoretical frameworks for the analy—
sis of population phenomena- This book analyses theoretical and method-
ological questions of the issue of social demography with special stress on
introductory notes, methods of data collection, fertility and mortality. It also
throws light on the theoretical aspects and dimensions of population, migra-
tion and population growth in India, composition and distribution of Indian
population and population policy in India. The book also analyses theoreti-
cal discourse of development, environment and its relationship with pop-
ulation. The volume represents a welcome elementary but Comprehensive
addition to the growing literature on social demography. This handbook will
attract the attention of students and scholars in the field of sociology, demog-
raphy, economics, political science, anthropology and development studies.
It will also be of interest to social activists, planners and policy makers.

INTRODUCTION
	An important component of any society is its members. Without popula-
tion, there will be no society. Since population is an integral part of society,
it is important to have information about various aspects of populatiOn. It
is here that demography or population studies have evolved as an impor-
tant discipline in the social sciences. In a broad sense, demography is the
study of various aspects of population. It focuses on numbers (size), fertility
(births), mortality (deaths), migration (movement of people from one place
to another), the density of population, the composition and characteristics
of population and changes taking place therein.
</p>
<p>
DEFINITION AND MEANING OF DEMOGRAPHY

Demography is a term derived from the two Greek words— demos, mean-
ing the people, and logos, which means to draw or to Write. Nowadays, it is
used to refer to the use of statistical methods to study human populations. It
deals primarily with the size and growth, or diminution, of populations; with
the numbers and proportions of persons living, being born or dying within
some area or region and with the measurement of related funCtions such as
rates of fertility, mortality and marriage. In other words, it is the processes of
population growth or decline, fertility, mortality and migration.

 The word ‘demography’ was for the first time used by A. Guillard, a
Frenchman, in his book Elements de Statistique Humanine. It is a statistical
study of population composition, distribution and trends.
</p>
<p>
Demography has been defined as follows:
</p>
<p>
Demography is the study of the size, territorial distribution, and the com-
position of population, changes therein, and the components of such
changes, which may be identified as natality, mortality, territorial move-
ment (migration), and social mobility.

                                                     	—Hauser and Duncan
</p>
<p>
Demography is the statistical and mathematical study of the size, composi-
tion and spatial distribution of human populations, and of the changes over
time in these aspects through the operation of the five processes of fertility,
mortality, marriage, migration and social mobility. Although it maintains a
continuous descriptive and comparatiVe analysis of trends, in each of these
processes and in their net results, its long-run goal is to develop a body of
theory to explain the events that it charts and encompasses.

                                                     	—Donald I. Bogue
</p>
<p>
Demography is the study of statistical methods of human population
involving primarily the measurement of the size, growth and diminution
of the members of the people, the proportions of living being born or dying
within the same area or region and the related functions of fertility, mortal-
ity and marriage.

                                                    	—Peter Cox
</p>
<p>
In a broad sense demography includes both demographic analysis and
population studies. A broad study of demography studies both qualitative
and quantitative aspects of population.

                                                   	—Frank Lorrimer
</p>
<p>
The population Student is interested in a population’s size, composition and
distribution, and in changes in these aspects through time, and the causes
of these changes. Ultimately, he is interested in these changes because they
are related to human welfare.

                                                     	—Thompson and Lewis
</p>
<p>
DemOgraphy is a broad social scienCe discipline concerned with the study
of human populations. In general, demographers deal with, the collection,
presentation and analysis of data relating to the basic life-cycle events and
experiences of people. They are birth, marriage, divorce, household and
family formation, employment, ageing, migration and death. The discipline
of demography stresses on the importance of empirical investigation of pop-
ulation processes, their conceptualization, measurement, determinants and
consequences. Demographers depend upon their related disciplinary areas
such as sociolOgy, economics, political science, anthropology, psychology,

<p>
public health and ecology for their study and analyses. They may explore
biological and biosocial aspects of fertility and mortality in areas such as
reproductive health and epidemiology; study of the social, economic, eco-
logical and genetic aspects of high and low fertility and mortality; economic
and geographical aspects of migration; the influence of geography and ecol—
ogy on composition and distribution of population and the consequences
of a particular population composition on the socio-economic fabric of a
society.
 </p>
<p>
Demography is concerned with the broader nature of social and eco-
nomic change, and the impact of demographic change on the natural envi-
ronment. Various concepts based on demography, such as cohorts, life
tables, event histories, population momentum and stable populations, have
significantly contributed to an understanding of social change.
 </p>
<p>
The following are some of the reasons for studying populations:
 </p>
<p>
. These studies haVe several administrative uses. Population statistics
 are related to matters such as the election of representative governing
bodies, tax collection and the working of industry and commerce.
The State also depends upon such studies for the provision of social
services and health services, maintenance of law and order and so on.
 </p>
<p>
.Every society has the specific aim of improving the quality of human
life, or at least of ensuring that it does not worsen. This aspect is asso-
ciated with the resources needed by people—food, shelter, meChani-
cal power and so on.
 </p>
<p>
. Population studies are essential for future planning. The available
number of people, and the estimated increases, will help the state to
plan for the coming years. It is on the basis of population statistics
that various state departments allocate funds for various develop-
mental programmes and activities.
 </p>
<p>
. On the basis of demographic data, the level of economic and social
growth and development can be ascertained. Social and ecOnomic
change can be ascertained through such data.
</p>
<p>
. It is important to know details of a population in order to under-
stand change in populations and the impact of such changes on the
environment.
</p>
<p>
. An intellectual necessity of satisfying the need for asCertaining why
things happen as they do. This innate curiosity to find out the What,
when, why and where of a population leads individuals to study vari-
ous demographic aspects.
 </p>
<p>
Population change is affected by various components suCh as birth, death and
migration rate. These put together determine the numbers in the population,

<p>
   its age composition and how fast it is growing or declining. Demographers
are interested in the number of males and females in a population (the sex
ratio), the age composition, the causes and consequences of migration, the
fertility and mortality rates and the causes and consequences of such rates,
and how and why changes take place in all these aspects.
</p>

<p>
Demography has developed into a remarkably coherent field, which
encompasses various aspects of human life. It has firmly established itself
as a discipline with strong ties with the policy-making agencies. Within the
discipline of demography, however, the recent years have shown an increas-
ing recognition of the limits of the existing theories and methods. This is
particularly obvious in the absence of a strong critical tradition, and the iso-
lation of the discipline from recent theoretical developments in other social
sciences.
</p>

<p>
NATURE AND SCOPE OF DEMOGRAPHY
 	The discipline of demography includes the study of theories, events and
policy propositions. It deals with vital issues relating to marriage, birth, life,
migration and death. Demography deals with three main aspects of popula-
tions, which are discussed in the following three sections:
</p>

<p>
Size

 	Size refers to the number of people living in a given place at a given point of
time. It looks at the changes taking place in the numbers, why such changes
are taking place and the consequences of such changes on the size of the
population. Clearly, identifying the terms ‘place’, ‘person’ and ‘time’ can
define the size of a population. A demographer’s concern is not only to find
out the numbers in a group, but also to study the population changes over
a period of time, and also to compare it with the populations of other areas.
Such comparison can be done for pOpulations Within a country or across
countries. Demographers can also predict the future size of a populatiOn on
the basis of the existing birth rate. These numbers are necessary for provid-
ing social utility services such as education, health facilities and medical aid,
legislators, planners and policy makers. These figures help the government
and planners to develop future plans, strategies and expansion activities. The
government can ensure adequate production of consumer goods, and make
arrangements for providing basic facilities for the population on the basis of
demographic data regarding the size of a population. Demographers look at
not only the changes in the size of population, but also the reasons or causes
of such change. There can be several Causes for such changes in population,
including changes in fertility and mortality rates, literacy and education
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00012">12</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:12
</h1>
<p>
 levels, age at marriage, lack of availability and use of health and medical
facilities, use of artificial means of birth control and so on.
 </p>

<p>
Composition

 	Composition of population refers to the measurable characteristics of a
population. These characteristics are, in general, related to demographic
processes. The most widely studied aspects of composition include age
structure, sex ratio, literacy and education levels, marital status including
age at marriage, occupational composition and rural—urban distribution
of population. The age structure of a population reveals the proportion of
population in different age groups, generally categorized broadly into the
young population (0—14 years), the working population (15—60 or 65 years)
and the older population (65 years and above). The sex ratio refers to the
number of females per 1000 males in a population. It reflects the socio-eco-
nomic conditions existing in a society. The low status of women, low female
literacy and low employment rate will show a negative female sex ratio.
In most developing and underdeveloped countries, this scenario is com-
mon, whereas in developed countries, there is a positive female sex ratio.
The occupation structure shows the employment and occupational patterns
existing in a country— the proportion of population engaged in agriculture,
industries and the services. Developing and underdeveloped countries show
an occupational structure that is predominantly agricultural, whereas devel-
oped countries show a major prOportion of the population engaged in the
industrial and service sectors. The age at marriage and marital status of a
population have a definite impact on the size of the population. The lower
the age at marriage, the longer will be the fertility span and the higher will
be the fertility rate, which will result in the higher growth rate of population.
This scenario is typical of underdeveloped and developing countries. </p>
<p>
  Thompson and Lewis state that the relationship between the composi-
tion of a population and its mortality, fertility and migration is a reciprocal
one— Composition affects the demographic processes and these processes in
turn affect the compositiOn by determining the age structure, sex ratio and
distribution of population.
</p>

<p>
Distribution

POpulation distribution refers to the territorial distribution of population
across cities and towns, villages and districts, states, zones, regions and
countries. Demographers find out the population within countries, across
countries and the world population. They also Study the population in
advanced industrialized and urbanized areas, newly developing and grow-
ing industrial urban areas, pre-urban industrial areas and developing and
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00013">13</pagenum>

Page no:13
</h1>
<p>
underdeveloped countries. Distribution of population in urban, semi-urban
and rural areas is an important aspect of this component of population stud-
ies. Demographers also look into the changes taking place in the distribution
of population, and the causes for these changes. Changes are basically due to
migration of people from one place to another.
</p>

<p>
According to Thompson and Lewis, the questions of how the WOrld’s
population is distributed among and within the continents, world regions
and countries, and how their numbers and proportions change can be
answered by learning about the demographic Concepts of size, composi-
tion and distribution, and demographic processes of fertility, mortality and
migration.
</p>

 <p>
  As a scientific study of human populations, demography uses a variety
of analytical techniques to turn raw data into more precise measures. This
branch of demography is usually referred to as formal or technical. demo-
graphy. Formal demography helps in understanding the causes and deter—
minants of population growth. This knowledge is essential for avoiding the
negative consequences of‘ increase in population. Apart from dealing with
the measures of fertility, mortality, nuptiality (marriages), migration and the
relationships between them, demography also deals with the size and com-
position of human populations at a given point in time. The relationships
between these elements. and the social, economic and cultural environment
within which they exist are also of interest to a demographer. This branch
of demography is referred to as substantive demography or population stud-
ies. Population studies provide the tools for examining the interactions of
demographic, social, economic, political and cultural processes, which are
the basis for human survival. In its broadest sense, demography deals with
these processes, which are necessary for effecting structural and institu-
tional changes in societies in order to bring about effective improvements
in living standards of the masses of the people. It is thus multi- disciplinary
in nature.
</p>

 <p>
There are different opinions regarding the scope of demography. Some
demographers believe that its scope is restricted and have narrowed down,
while others consider it to have a broad scope. There are yet others, who give
a balanced view on the scope of demography. These views are discussed in
the following section.
  </p>

 <p>
Broad View of the Scope of Demography

Those who subscribe to the broad view of the scope of demography believe
that demography IS a study of causes of slow or rapid growth of birth rates,
Causes of changes in mortality rates, population growth or decrease, nega-
tive or positive female sex ratio and causes for the same and so on. Many
economic problems are also demographic problems— standard of living,
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00014">14</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:14
</h1>
<p>
unemployment, income levels, poverty, prOduction and consumption,
Saving habits, work efficiency and so on. These are, in fact, influenced con-
siderably by the existing population. The problems associated with ade—
quate or inadequate food supply are also directly linked to the problem of
population size.
 </p>
 <p>
Demography helps in understanding various issues related to marital
status, composition of family, trends and changes in religious beliefs, caste,
education and so on. Trends in urbanization, problems of rural—urban
migration, distribution of population and other such aspects help in the
understanding of geography and its impact on population. In this way,
demography is considered to be a collective study of human life. ACcording
to Hans Raj (2003), demography deals with individual ancestries, heredi-
tary nature of population and collects facts aboutphysical, social and vital
aspects of population. It registers vital events, such as birth, marriage, family,
divorce, disease and sickness, death and population growth. Population data
becomes socially useful when demographers make inferences from them.
Population statistics will haVe meaning only when demographers give them
meaning.
 </p>
<p>
In its broad sense, demography IS a multidisciplinary subject. It depends
upon, and makes significant contributions to, the disciplines of biology,
statistics, genetics, medicine, agriculture, education, ecology and environ-
mental sciences, to name a few. Demography is the study of the size, com-
position, spatial distribution of human populations and the changes in
these aspects over time. Subjects such as nutrition, food— fertility relation-
ship, employment and manpower planning, resource management policies,
income distribution and other related aspects are included in the scope of
demography. Almost all topics related to human welfare and improving the
quality of life are included in demography. It is therefore difficult to limit
its scope. Demography includes two aspects —it is macro— static or looks at
national aggregates at a particular point of time, and is also macro — dynamic
or studies national aggregates over a period of time. It has both descriptive
as well as analytical aspects.
 </p>
<p>
Narrow View of the Scope of Demography

Demographers who subscribe to the narrow View of the subject include
Whipple, Philip Hauser and Otis Dudley Duncan. According to them, the
scope of demography is limited to the study of births, deaths, marriages, dis-
eases and migration. Hauser and Duncan have defined demography as the
study of size, territorial distribution and composition of population, changes
therein and the factors of such changes Which include natality, territorial
movement or migration, social mobility and mortality. They believe that it
is not possible to have an all encompassing, integrated and comprehensive
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00015">15</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
 theory of demography, since such a theory would have to include other dis-
ciplines. The Scope of demography should be limited to one discipline and
should not be multidisciplinary. Everything concerning population cannot
be studied under demography. There should be a ‘frame of reference’ for
the discipline, which by nature is selective. They also state that the scope of
demography is not as wide as it is made out to be by some thinkers. although
demography deals with several other subjects, it does not mean that all such
subjects can be studied under demography. One of the important topics stud-
ied under demography is urbanization. It includes communication, rehabili-
tation, transportation, administrative system, banking and other services,
and so on. All these areas, however, cannot be included under demography
and cannot be studied with its help. If the study of urbanization includes all
the aspects mentioned earlier, it will make the subject unmanageable and
unwieldy. It is, therefore, important to restrict and narrow down the scope
of demography.
</p>

<p>
Those who believe that the scope of demography is narrow emphasize
on the ‘qualitative’ aspect of demography and population studies. According
to Barkley, the field of demography does not deal with behaviour patterns,
but with aggregates of people. It is the numerical portrayal of human popula-
tion that is called demography.
</p>

<p>
Balanced View of Demography

A third school of thought prescribes a balanced view of the scope of demog-
raphy. Thompson and Lewis state that demography can study births, deaths,
growth rate of population, the sex ratio, female literacy, health conditions,
marital status, rural—urban population distribution, classification of popula-
tion on the basis of occupations and information on their social and eco-
nomic conditions. Today, demography is considered to be a study of human
soCiety, and not of individualistic human problems. Mathematical and statis—
tical tools are required to understand various aspects of human populations.
Demography is to an extent dependent upon various other sciences, and the
population is studied from economic, social and political angles. However, it
is confined to the study of organization and distribution of groups.
</p>
<p>
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF DEMOGRAPHY

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact time or date which saw the rise of demo-
graphic studies. In fact, it is said that demographic study is as old as society
itself— it started when human beings created civil society. People and societ-
ies across the world have kept an account or records of the human popula-
tion. With the passage of time, societies started realizing the importance and

<p>
 necessity of maintaining proper population records. The Egyptian civiliza-
tion, the Chinese, Greek and ancient Indian civilizations maintained popu-
lation records. As far back as in 2030 BCE, it appears that the population
of Jeddah, a city in Saudi Arabia, was counted. In fact, the system of reg-
istrations has a long history. As early as in 1250 BCE, during the reign of
King Rameses II in Egypt, an elaborate registration system was set up to
register Vital events in different periods and for different reasons. Churches
started keeping records of baptism, marriages and deaths of their followers.
In 480 BCE, Zerxes had his soldiers counted before invading Greece. Ancient
records also show that Romans had their population counted for the first
time in 435 BCE after which it was frequently counted. In India, the popula-
tion was counted during the period of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
Kautilya’s Arthashastra mentions the process of pOpulation counting in the
country. Similar references have also been made in Ain-i-Akbari.
</p>

<p>
In recent times, Henry VIII of England had records of the viCtims of the
Plague of 1535 CE prepared. Though population counting was not an end in
itself, it was a means to an end— to know the strength of the armed fOrces,
to make an estimate of the available manpower, especially for the purpose of
invading other countries, and to know how many persons had been added
for the purpose of collecting taxes. Religious organizations also maintained
records of births and deaths in order to know the number of followers.
</p>

<p>
It was in the middle of the seventeenth century that population studies
emerged as a discipline in England. MOSt Of the early deVelopments in the
discipline toOk place in England and other European. countries. Later, the
USA became an important contributor to the development of the discipline.
</p>

<p>
The credit for starting demOgraphic studies in modern times goes to JOhn
Graunt (1620—74). He initiated a new field of empirical research in popula—
tion studies. His famous volume entitled Natural and Political Observations
upon the Bills of Mortality was published in 1662. It is the first important
work in the history of population studies. It was mainly a quantitative analy-
sis of mortality, in which the causes and number of deaths for certain places
were dealt with. Some details Of births, migration and family growth were
also given. He also made an analysis of the population which was capable of
serving in the army. The ‘bills of mortality’ from Which Graunt got the data
for analysis were weekly current reports on christening and burials taken
from London and its surrounding areas. Parish clerks maintained regular
registrations of these events. This data was taken for the period between
1604 and 1661 and a report was prepared. This is considered to be the first
systematic and objective analysis of population.
</p>

<p>
Graunt concluded that the proceSses of mortality, fertility and migration
were interrelated. One of his postulates was that birth rate related to male
sex was greater than that related to the female sex; if in a given society the
number of males and females is equal. He also stated that the mortality rate
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00017">17</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 17
</h1>
<p>
was higher in urban than in rural areas, and that it was higher at the begin-
ning of life than at later stages. Graunt also used the sample survey method
to collect data.
</p>

<p>
Graunt critically analysed data on fertility and mortality, and pointed out
their weakness, as well as their biases and inadequacies. He started the tradi-
tions of evaluating population data and making observations on the data.
He also estimated the size and growth of London’s population. According to
Peter R. Cox, ‘Graunt’s work covers so wide an area of interest that it may be
said that a large part of demography was born all at once. The developments
that occurred subsequently were in the nature of consolidation.’
</p>

<p>
William Petty (1623— 87) continued the work of John Graunt. Petty was
an English scholar and a contemporary and friend of Graunt. His work Essay
on Political Arithmetic had a considerable influence on the development of
population studies, and enhanced the status and prestige of the discipline by
bringing it to the focus of the Royal Society. In Political Arithmetic, Petty
stated his views about population growth, unemployment, urbanization,
national income and so on. He was of the opinion that central statistical
office would be of immense help for population studies. Petty also prepared
life tables.
</p>

<p>
William Halley (1656—1742) made an important contribution to the
development of population studies. He constructed the first empirical life
table, based on the available data on births and deaths. He based this on the
assumption that life and death rate will basically remain static. He soon con-
cluded that it would be difficult to maintain static population growth rate.
He also coined the term ‘expectation of life’. Halley’s work inspired research
in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and other European countries.
</p>

<p>
Johann Peter Sussmilch was a Lutherian clergyman who lived during
the reign of Frederick the Great. He collected figures about various aspects
of population— age at marriage, number of deaths, cauSes of death, growth
of population and so on— and analysed them. He wrote a massive volume
of 1200 pages in which he combined data collected from Germany, France
and Sweden. He based his findings on a large number of observations, and
is credited with being the first person to stress on the ‘law of large num -
bers’. He was of the opinion that the value of any study increases with the
number of cases on which the findings are based. He tried to prepare mor-
tality tables, which would have universal applicability. On the basis of data
collected, SuSSmilch concluded that deaths were more frequent in the first
few weeks of life, and were low at around the age of fifteen. He studied fac—
tors affecting fertility —age at marriage, disruption of marriage by separation
or death, effects of health problems or diseases and so on. He also tried to
estimate the world’s population in his book The Divine Order. However, he
gave a religious explanation for population change and movement, seeing a
divine hand in them.

Gregory King and Richard Price made important contributions to the
development of population studies. King was an English scholar who made
estimates of the populations of England and Wales, which at that time was
a first estimate of its kind. Richard PriCe prepared life tables and analysed
the birth and death rates, as well as the growth rate of the population of
Sweden. One of his most important contributions came in the form of the
preparation of the Northampton Table, which was based on the death rate
in Northampton area. He assumed that the population would remain static,
with the result that emphasis was laid on death rate.

  These demographic pioneers' work had the same characteristics as
  those of their successors today. Some of the similarities of their work
  are as follows :
  1. It was dependent on the data  having come into existence at the
  whim of others, usually governments, for other purposes (e.g., the
  London Bills of Mortality were a means of detecting epidemics,
  principally plague).

  2. Much of the labour was spent not on making immediate deductions
  from the numbers but on suspiciously testing the data and trying to
  improve them. This central assumption that the raw data are almost certainly
  imperfect sets demographers apart from most social, medical and statistical scientists.

  3. Demographers are deeply sensitive to the fact that crude numbers or measures
  may be misleading, owing to such factors as the age and sex structure of the population,
  they are given to devising measures that will overcome the distortions and allow valid
  comparisons.

  4. There is a concept of population, a large body of people constituting some kind of definable unit to which the measurements pertain.

  5. The attention to large populations, often national ones, explains why demograph 'arithmetic' is political. Often , indeed, its practitioners wanted to gauge the health of the body politic and even to point the direction of improvement. Such policy involvement did not become controversial until the twentieth century when controversy arose, first over focuses on migrants and differential fertility in response to the eugenics movement, and later over
                                                                                  	(continued)

research appearing to support the call for a curb on the Third World fertility.

6. Demographers are suspicious of the study of individuals and small groups , feeling
   groups, feeling that such persons are significant only when it can be shown what
   fraction of a larger population they constitute and even then that the fraction is
   of a considerable size.

7. Demographers look for regularities in populations or subpopulations and for contrasts between subpopulations: Graunt showed urban - rural differentials in mortality, as well as male - female differentials in both numbers born and subsequent mortality.

8. From the beginning, there has also been an interest in causation (Graunt examined the causes
   of death), but there has, at the same time, been a suspicion that measures of causes were
   more likely to be in error than measures of population or death.

9. Until the nineteenth century in France and the twentieth century elsewhere, morality and
   population growth dominated demographers' interests; fertility became an item of interest
   only when birth rates began to decline and the major concern only during the 1960s to 1980s,
   when interest focused on the beginning of fertility decline in developing countries.

10. Demography has always been an empirical discipline maintaining almost uniquely the
   nineteenth- century positivist attitudes throughout the twentieth century. Most demographers
   have been happy to carry out analyses within a minimalist theoretical frame- work and have been
   happy to carry out analyses within a minimalist theoretical frame- work and have been
   deeply suspicious of disciplines which built theoretical structures upon unproven,
   theoretical bases. They have preffered intermediate or the short- range theory to the grand
   theory.

11. Nevertheless, the population field has also given birth to the grand theory, associated
	with such names as Thomas Robert Malthus, Arsene Dumont, Frank W. Notestein,
	Thomas Mckeown, Ester Boserup and Philippe Aries. They have set up frame works
	which have consciously or unconsciously generated much of the shorter- range
	research, and have made the subject known beyond its practitioners.

12. Once demographers had established the usual levels of mortality and fertility they became
	interested in change, especially when the demographic transition was underway.
	Modern demographic has not only a population base but also a time dimension. There

</p>

<p>
	is hardly a major demographic study in the twentieth  century in which change
	over a period (usually of years) is not important.

13. Demographers, in contrast to epidemiologists,  are usually concerned with total
	mortality decline, and are suspicious of approaches singling out advances in
	treating specific diseases, and of any attempt to treat total mortality decline
	as the sum of individual medical breakthroughs. When they do trace mortality
	changes from one cause, they usually want to see what has also happened to mortality
	from other causes.

 <p>
The history Of the development of demography can be divided into different
Phases. They are discussed in the following.
 </p>

<p>
First Phase

 The credit for systematically and scientifically analysing population dynamics
goes to Robert Malthus. In his work An Essay on the Principles of Population,
as it Affects the Future Improvement of Society, he concluded that popula-
tion grows in geometrical proportion, whereas fOOd production grows in an
arithmetic proportion. This results in an imbalance in the availability of food
production to the existing population, and subsequently there will be a situ-
ation Where there will be acute food shortage. Malthus drew the attention of
the world to the dangers of rapid population growth. As a result, population
trends and problems were given more attention, and were critically analysed
in different parts of the world. Though Malthus’s study and approach came in
for considerable criticism, it is considered the first phase of population study.
 </p>

<p>
At the time that Malthus was propounding his theory of population
growth, a Chinese philosopher Hingliange Chi was also studying popula-
tion problems, and came to similar conclusions as Malthus—that moral
restraints were essential for checking pOpulation growth. Like Malthus,
Hingliange Chi also stated that population growth was responsible for pov-
erty. These ideas were, however, subsequently challenged by Karl Marx, who
stated that poverty would not end merely by checking growth of population
but through powerful social revolution.
 </p>

<p>
Second Phase

With the beginning of the nineteenth century, the second phase of popula-
tion studies began. Several studies were conducted in the later part of the
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00021">21</pagenum>

<p>
first phase, though it was difficult to find out uniformity in them. During
this phase, Joshua Milne and William Farr tried to improve the field of
demographic studies. Farr tried to establish a relationship between actuar-
ies and demography. He was appointed in the General Registrar Office in
England and made significant contributions to the methodology of popu-
lation analysis by constructing life tables. He also studied occupational
mortality. John Finalison Concluded that in order to have realistic popula-
tion estimation, there should be proper registration of births, deaths and
marriages. This resulted in help being sought from birth and death regis—
tration offices for every study on social progress. As a result of the efforts
of these demographers, the study of population problems became a mat-
ter of serious concern in many European countries. England became the
Country Where substantial contribution was made to the field of population
studies.
  </p>

<p>
In the second phase, relationship of mortality with fertility was stud-
ied. Demography was being accepted as an important field of study, and was
recognized by the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography. It
gained recognition as a science dealing with births, deaths, migration and
marriages. In this phase, Acille Guillard published his study Elements de
Statisque Humanie on Demographic COmparee.
  </p>

<p>
Third Phase

The third phase of population studies started at the turn of the twentieth
century. In 1922, Carr Saunders brought out his famous work The Population
Problem: A Study of Human Evolution, in which he tried to develop demog-
raphy as a new branch of knowledge. He also developed the optimum theory
of population. He also tried to make demography a part of the family of
social sciences. He believed that population problems were related to human
behaviour and control. According to Thompson and Lewis,
  </p>

<p>
Carr Saunders may be said to sponsor the theory that man’s growth in
numbers has been largely determined by the economically desirable num-
bers under his conditions of life... But, since Carr Saunders regards man’s
growth as wholly within his control and as conditioned by the attitude of
mind he has developed under his institutions and particular physical con-
ditions of his life, his theory stands in sharp contrast with those which were
based on natural law.
  </p>

<p>
During this phase, Arsene Dumont developed the Theory of Social Capillarity,
based on a study of the population of France. According to him, a rigid social
structure prevents upward movement in the society, which prevents individ-
ual development from becoming so engrossing that individuals have no time
for rearing a family. Other important contributions to the field of population
  </p>

<p>
studies and demography came from Euler, Dudwig MOser and Alfred Lokta,
who developed the quantitative theories of population.
 </p>

<p>
  	In the USA, Walter Wilcox published his statistical analysis of divorce.
Louis Dubblin and Lotka publiShed their work on stable population model,
considered to be an important landmark in the growth of population stud-
ies. The Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems was estab-
lished with an important demographer, Warren Thompson as its Director.
In 1937, the Population Association of America was established in Princeton
University. Attempts were made to collect figures and facts about America’s
population, and demographers tried to classify the population under various
categories. Population predictions were made on the basis of data collected.
The Mathematical approach was used to analyse aspects of population
change and growth. Verhulst developed the Logistic Curve theory of popu—
lation growth, which stated that over a period of time, the population of a
country will become zero and stabilize.
 </p>

<p>
 	Experts who carried out demographic studies included Cannan,
Bowley, Pearl and Whepton. Organizations that were involved in demo-
graphic studies included the British Royal Commission and the UNO, the
International Union for the Scientific Study of Populations, which enrolled
several eminent demographers from different parts of the world. Other
important organizations included the Population Council, USA; the Institute
National D’Eludes Demographiques in Paris; the Population Investigation
Committee, London; and the Population Commission appointed by the
UNO.
</p>

<p>
 	Demographic and population studies received a considerable attention
after World War II. The efforts of individuals and national and international
organizations helped in making demography an independent subject. The
UNO and other international bodies made significant contributions in the
field of population studies. The International Union for the Scientific Study
of Population, sponsored several congresses of which the first on a worldwide
scale was held in Rome in 1954 under the auspices of the United Nations
Organization. This is known as the first World Population Conference, 1954.
The Conference consisted of 31 meetings held over 11 days, and more than
400 papers were presented. There were two main groups of topics—the ‘hap-
penings’ and the ‘methods.’ The ‘happenings’ included topics such as fertil-
ity and mortality trends, distribution of population, migratory movements,
ageing and its consequences, population in relation to resources and social
aspects of demographic changes. The aspects included under ‘methods’ were
evaluation of the quality of demographic data, techniques of measurement,
definitions and concepts, legislation, administration, actuarial and other
studies, and training and recruitment.
 </p>

<p>
This conference was followed by other conferences at Belgrade in
1965 and in Bucharest in 1974. The year 1974 was celebrated as UN World
 </p>

<p>
	Population Year, and several population— related activities were taken up
across the world. The UNO, in collaboration with the Government of
India, set up the Demographic Training and Research Centre at Bombay,
now known as the International Institute for Population Sciences. Other
such centres were set up in Chile, Cairo, Aracia, Yaounde and Bucharest.
The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific at Bangkok
has been actively promoting regional population studies. The UN
Demographic Year Book is an authentic source material for demographic
data. World population problems are of interest to various organizations
such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Economic, Social and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
 </p>

<p>
Fourth Phase

It was this phase that witnessed the emergence of the communist population
doctrine. Communism was a well— established philosophy and ideology in
the twentieth century. Karl Marx, the founder of this philosophy, also dis-
cussed population problems. Marx did not agree with Malthus that popula-
tion was the most important cause of human poverty. He was of the opinion
that overpopulation was the creation of capitalist society. Poverty was the
result of unemployment, a consequence of the inability of the capitalist sys-
tem to provide jobs for all. He also believed that under communism, there
would be no human poverty, regardless of population growth. Even today,
Communists adhere to the View that it is capitalism and not population
growth that is responsible for poverty. In other parts of the world, however,
it is believed that population growth and poverty go hand—in-hand. This
applies more to countries where natural resources are limited and do not
meet the needs of the existing population.
 </p>

<p>
RELATIONSHIP OF DEMOGRAPHY WITH OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES

 	Demography is essential for understanding population
 dynamics. It cuts across many conventional disciplinary
 boundaries, and combines rigorous mathematics and reliable
 statistics. It depends, to a certain extent, upon both social and
 biological sciences. Since people are an essential component
 of a society, it is important to understand various aspects of
 people, or the population. The interdisciplinary nature of
 demography can be understood from Figure 1.1.
 Analysis of demographic data is based on the methodologi-
 cal sciences of mathematics and statistics. These disciplines -

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00024">24</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:24
</h1>
<p>
provide a secure technical footing for the discipline of demography.
Demographers depend upon social and biological sciences for explana—
tory frameworks in order to understand and explain the determinants of
demographic behaviour and population trends, and to explore their rela-
tionship with wider trends in the society and in the economy. Advances in
demography influence the social and biological sciences and enhance and
improve their perspectives on population themes. Demography provides
important and relevant information for public discussion, and the formu-
lation and analysis of policy.
 </p>

<p>
Demography is a discipline that prefers facts over speculations, and a
commitment to scientific rigor. Its practitioners overwhelmingly eschew
hyperbole and oversimplification of the complex issues facing society. As
we enter the twenty- first century, demography has the potential to build two
bridges— one connecting the social sciences with biology and other branches
of the natural sciences, and the second linking theory and policy conCerns.
The most important objective of demographic studies is to understand the
characteristics of populations as a whole. This would include their total size,
their composition by age and sex, their geographical and occupational dis-
tributions, and the trend in time of all these elements. Demography interacts
with virtually all the social sciences and makes use of variables from other
disciplines, for example, economics, social psychology, sociology, biology,
geography and so on. There are also various subdisciplines of demography,
such as economic demography, social demography, historical demography,
mathematical demography and so on. These are based on the contributions
of social scientists to the study, and the explanation of the complex rela-
tionships between demographic and socio-economic, political and cultural
variables. We shall now look at the relationship between demography and
other sciences.
 </p>

<p>
Demography and Sociology

Demography is mainly concerned with the collection of material and the
study of various aspects of a country’s population. It is concerned with the
biological, economic aspects of population change and their consequences.
Sociology is based on the premise that man is a social animal. Demography
also accepts that human beings are a unit of society, and they form a group
in which individuals are born and in which they die. In spite of these dynam-
ics, the group remains the same— it changes only in size. Sociologists treat
demography as a discipline which does not merely collect figures, but which
is necessary for understanding the social reactions and pressures. This pro—
vides a link between the two subjects. Both sociology and demography
study issues related to birth, death and marriage— age at marriage, marriage
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00025">25</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:25
</h1>
<p>
systems, marriage customs and traditions, divorce, death and so on. In fact,
it has been said that demographic behaviour is an aspect of socio- psycho-
logical behaviour of individuals and has an effect on demographic processes
and events. There are several socio— economic factors that influence demo-
graphic behaviour.
 </p>

<p>
The close relationship between sociology and demography is revealed in
the fact that problems associated with population are also considered to be
social problems. For understanding and solving population problems, social
approach is considered necessary: For example, if the growth rate of popula-
tion is to be restricted and brought down, the whole outlook of society will
have to undergo a change. A climate will have to be created in which people
can realize that children are not necessary for security in old age— the state
can help the aged and the disabled, and provide adequate security for them.
While analysing the collected data, if a demographer ignores the social
aspects, the demographic analysis will be rendered useless. The close rela-
tionship between sociology and demography is bound to be there because of
the close link between society and human beings. Both are interdependent
upon each other, and each cannot survive Without the other. Unless there is
a society, there can be no demography, and sociology needs a society with
human beings to study.
 </p>

<p>
Demography deals with birth rates, which are directly linked to the
institution of marriage. This institution is of importance to a sociologist.
The rate of growth of population depends not only on biological factors, but
also on the social outlook regarding the birth of children. The social outlook
is another factor that binds sociology and demography. Demographers are
also interested in death rates in the society, which are in turn influenced
by, and in turn affect, the social conditions. These include social habits,
environments, living conditions of the peOple and so on. Both sociologists ,
and demographers study the extent of scientific development in the sOci-
 ety, and its contribution in checking the mortality rates. Both subjects study
population, social organization, socialization patterns and their impact on
institutions such as the family and on demographic processes Such as fer-
tility and mortality. Associations, collective behaviour, ecology, urbaniza—
tion and various groups such as minorities, professional groups, tribes, etc.
are commonly studied by sociology as well as demography. Fertility rate,
mortality rate and migration problems are considered not only by demog-
raphers, but also by sociologists. This is one of the reasons why demography
is considered a subfield or a branch of sociology, with a difference that it
has more specialized variables and tools of analyses. Even in the academic
world, demography and sociology are placed together. In fact, in many insti-
tutions of higher education, demography is taught in the Department of
Sociology.

<p>
                        	Box 1.2

When a demographer deals with birth statistics, he has to remember
that each of the figures represents a son or a daughter; when he deals
with deaths he has to remember that each represents a tragedy, When
he deals with migration he has to remember that it means movement
of homes; when he deals with marriages he has to remember that he is
dealing with a basic institution of human society

                                      	—Frank Notestein in SrivaStava
</p>

<p>
Despite such close relationship between demography and sociology, there
are differences between the two disciplines. Demography is a subject that
deals with quantitative analysis of figures and data collected through various
demographic methods, such as census, sample surveys and Vital registra-
tions. Sociology, on the other hand, studies different social institutions and
their interactions with one another. Demography is quantitative, whereas
sociology is qualitative in nature— it is made-up of non- quantitative descrip-
tions and generalizations about social patterns and Structures, which cannot
be easily subject to quantification. Demography makes use of several statisti-
cal and mathematical methods of data analysis. Certain ‘distributive’ aspects
such as age, sex, occupation and so on study society, whereas sociology stud-
ies aspects such as social structure or culture. It also uses such methods,
though in a much more limited way. Another difference between the tWo
disciplines is that in demography, the data are divided into small units, and
each unit is scientifically studied and analysed. On the other hand, sociology
combines small units such as language, religion, marriage, etc. into one large
whole, and studies it thereafter. Thus, while demography begins from the
whole and then goes to smaller units, sociology combines units into a whole
and studies them accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Social demography is an important branch of demography, which is
emerging in different parts of the world. It deals with the social causes and
consequences of changes in various aspects of population. Demographic and
socio—cultural factors are seen to be mutually reciprocal. Various social and
psychological factors, which include values, attitudes and beliefs, influence
demographic processes. Social demography deals with relationships between
demographic and social phenomena. It is different from pure demography,
which deals with relationships among various demographic variables that
make the demographic system, all demographic processes take place within a
social context. Social demographic theory is strongly influenced by sociological
theories. Davis and Moore state that demographic changes can be of two kinds:

i. Reflexive changes, which affect other components in the social sys-
   tem and in turn bring about changes in the component initiating the
   change.

ii. Behavioural changes, which involve human decisions. For example,
	in societies where there has been a long- standing problem, of increas-
	ing population, people may choose from a number of alternatiVe
	methods of birth control.
</p>

<p>
Social demography also studies the influence of informal groups on fertility
and family size; social demographers consider the high female dependency
ratio to be a major cause for high fertility, and emphasize on the indepen-
dence of women for reducing fertility rates. They feel that women should
enjoy equal status as men in taking fertility decisions.

Demography and Economics

	Over the years, there has been a change in the relationship between demog-
raphy and economics, and in many countries today, demography is treated as
a branch of economics. Economics is the study of various economic aspects
and problems of members of a society, in which demographic and popu-
lation studies play a vital role. With an increase in population, economic
activities and problems are bound to increase. Population problems are con-
nected with economic issues of employment, per capita income, education,
transportation, industrialization and so on. These problems are magnified in
developing and underdeveloped countries, where the populations are large
and the rate of growth of populations is high.
</p>

<p>
Demography influences the field of economics in different ways. It is a
means of labour, and becomes the source of production. Changes in popula-
tion influence labour force and the source of production. Economic activi-
ties are, in general, aimed at the welfare of people. Population increase will
lead to increase in all economic activities. Population influences the per cap-
ita income, production, labour, income distribution, industrialization and
so on. In developing and underdeveloped countries where populations are
large, labour-intensive techniques are used in production, in order to pro-
Vide employment to the maximum possible number of people. In developed
countries, where the populations are comparatively small, capital- intensive
techniques are more popular.
</p>

<p>
Population IS also an indiCator of economic development and growth. In
general, a larger population would hinder the growth rate and development
of a country. In fact, population explosion has threatened the economies of
countries across the world. Developing and underdeveloped countries are
trying to decrease the growth rate of their populations in order to improve
the economic conditions of their people.
</p>

<p>

The relationship between demography and economics can be summed
up as follows:

i. Increase in population will force the nation to consider sources of
   production, distribution and consumption, on the one hand, and pro—
   vide more employment opportunities, on the other.

ii. Population explosion will force the country to divert certain
	resources to the production of consumables and non-consumables
	which are required by children and the production of which is
	unavoidable.

iii. Decrease in the mortality rate and increase in life span will force a
 	country to produce more goOds for the consumption of the aged.

iv. Population growth helps economists in finding out the percentage of
   resources needed at a particular point of time for meeting the basic
   necessities of the people. It is necessary for planning for the future
   educational, health and infrastructural facilities.

v. Demographic data is required to know the availability of labour force
   within the country. It also helps eConomists in understanding the
   distribution of the working pOpulation across various occupations. It
   also indicates the working and non-working population, as well as the
	old and young dependency ratio.

vi. Demography helps economists in finding out the extent of unem—
	ployment, and the types of training and opportunities required to
	decrease or remove unemployment.

Vii. Population problems are closely linked to economic problems. One Of
	the basic causes of most economic problems is overpopulation. These
	result in unemployment, poverty, increased young dependency and
	so on.

viii. Population is also directly linked to the food problem. The more the
  	population, the more difficult it becomes to feed the population.

ix.  Population growth, size and distribution can be viewed from the
 	point of view of economic growth and change.

</p>

 <p>
	Despite such a close relationship between the two subjects, both have a
separate and distinct identity of their own, and have separate entities and
existence. The scope of economics is wide, and one aspect of its scope is
demographic data. It consists of a planned use of economic resources, and
also suggests ways in which these resources can be properly exploited. In
comparison to economics, the scope of demography is limited to the collec-
tion and analysis of data. The demographer provides the data, which acts as
a foundation on which economists build the superstructure.

Demography and Human Ecology

Demography and human ecology are closely linked to each other. Population
is the direct result of births, which is of interest to human ecologists. Human
ecology is the study of births, environment and the relationship between
the two. An increase in population affects the surrounding environment —it
can result in overcrowding, increase in the density of population leading to
urbanization and environmental pollution.
</p>

<p>
                      	Box 1.3

 From the ecological viewpoint, population can be seen in terms of the
extent to which people share in exploiting and developing the same
enVironmental resources ... Ecology is nothing but bio- demography.
Experiments have left no doubt that the population and food habits
have close links with each other. Ecology tells us that parasites with low
survival possibilities in their complex life have high fertility and that is
the reason that the mortality rate among the poor is very high. In the
case of human beings too, there is a positive correlation between high
fertility and high mortality. Since a demographer also studies death and
birth rates, the relationship between the two is quite understandable.

                                                	Hans Raj, p.22; Srivastava
</p>

<p>
One can establish the relationship between demography and human ecology
from the fact that life tables are studied by both the disciplines. Human ecol-
ogy provides a general perspective, and principles, concepts and hypotheses,
which are of immense significance to demography. Moreover, it is seen that
population density changes with climatic conditions. In places where the
climate is either extremely hot or extremely cold, the density of population
is low because of difficult living conditions. In places with moderate climate,
the population density is high.
</p>

<p>
The main issues in human ecology can be placed in a frame containing
four referential concepts: population, environment, technology and organi-
zation. It is within an environment that a particular population lives. Every
population has to adjust to the environment in order to survive. Population
can also change the environment in which it lives. Human ecologists take
into consideration not only biological explanations of population, but also
its socio-cultural aspects.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to differentiate a human ecologist from a demographer.
A human ecologist is interested in a wide variety of demographic issues

<p>
and problems, makes use of demographic data and relies heavily on demo-
graphic techniques. Demographic aspects determine ecological organiza-
tion, and are in turn determined by ecology. It is imperative that there be
coOperation between demographers and human ecologists to solve a variety
of human problems.
  </p>

 <p>
     	Ecology is called ‘bio-demography’. Both ecology and demography
study biological explanations of human fertility as well as the effect of den-
sity of population on human fertility. Certain issues such as relationships
between various species, between food and fertility, between predator- prey,
host- parasite and so on are studied both by human ecologists as well as
demographers.
  </p>

<p>
Demography and Geography

	The later half of the twentieth century witnessed an increase in geogra-
phers’ interest in demography and population studies. Geography is a sci-
ence which deals with the spatial distribution of resources and population.
The emphasis of the subject has been gradually shifting from the ‘physical’
aspect to the ‘human aspect’, and the ‘geocentric’ View is giving way to the
‘anthropocentric’ View. Since the 1960s, population geography has become a
distinct branch of human geography, with a specific body of material, meth-
odology and perspeCtive. Population geography deals with ways in which
the geographical character of a place is formed by, and which in turn reacts
upon, a set of population phenomena which vary across time and space and
follow their own behavioural laws, interacting with one another and with a
number of non- demographic phenomena.
  </p>

<p>
Demography and geography study the relationship between spatial dis-
tribution of population and the demographic processes of fertility, mortal-
ity and migration. Population demography includes the study of location
and characteristics of population, spatial distribution of population and
patterns of spatial distribution, and the interrelationship between the geo-
graphic environment and population. It has been suggested that population
geography should include identification O genetic relations, i.e., dealing with
categorization, clasSification and various processes; establishing genetic rela—
tions of spatial distributions wherein temporal changes assume considerable
significance; and determining the covariant relationships and interaction
between geographic phenomena.
  </p>

<p>
The concepts of space, the physical and biotic features of the earth, the
patterns of settlement, distribution of population, villages, towns and cities
and the relations between different parts of the earth’s surface come under
the purview of the discipline of geography. There is an increasing empha—
sis on human geography, which emphasizes on the cultural features of the
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00031">31</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 31
</h1>
<p>
	earth in addition to the physical features. These features are analysed both
generically and genetically in their space relations. Population geography
tries to establish relations between cultural features and the physical and
biotic environment. Both demography and geography show interest in
population differentiation, attributes of population, population settlement
patterns and settlement interrelations, and the relationship between natu-
ral resources and population. Demographic data is collected from differ-
ent geographical regions—states, zones, regions and so on. Analysis and
comparison of demographic data is also done across geographic areas.
The analysis of demographic data is of importance to human geographers.
Specific demographic processes such as birth rates, death rates and migra—
tion patterns are studied for specific regions. Geographers also use demo-
graphic predictions. Various demographic issues such as health conditions,
distribution of population, migration, age and sex ratios, occupational dis-
tribution, the pOpulation economics dynamics and so on are today a part
of the study of geography. It was geographers who advocated the idea of
rural— urban integrated development. Geographers are also interested in the
study of co -variation among population distribution, settlement patterns
and functions, which led to the redefinition of human geography as ‘human
ecology’.
</p>

<p>
  	The structures of settlement and population agglomeration (collection)
and social functions are of interest to both demographers as well as geogra-
phers. The ‘landscape school of geography’ has given way to the geographical
study of racial, societal and economic features of a population inhabiting a
particular geographic area. The scope of demography has widened to include
geographical studies of populations. Both the disciplines are interested in
the climate, biotic processes, organizational evolution, demographic move-
ments and the resulting changes in space content.
</p>

<p>
  	Population geography focuses on the ‘spatial’ aspect of distribution of
population, its structure, composition, density, mobility, migration, growth
and other demographic processes. The spatial distribution of demographic
elements and spatial variations in human populations is an important part of
population geographical studies. The study of demographic facts in an envi-
ronmental context, their characteristics, causes, origins and consequences
are also of interest to population geographers. The discipline studies humans
and their relationship with the surrounding environment and resources. It
examines the influence of the physical and cultural environment on popu-
lations. The physical environment includes the location, climate, flora and
fauna, soils, natural resources, etc. Cultural environment consists of the
economy, political and social factors, education, technology, transport and
communication, settlements, urbanization, etc. Demographers as well as
population geographers study their influence on demographic processes and
demographic phenomena.

<p>
Demography and Anthropology

Anthropologists are interested in demographic processes of fertility, mat—
ing, mortality, population numbers and migration of various subgroups in a
population. In fact, ethnology, a branch of anthropology, studies the distribu—
tion of races across the world. Physical anthropology interprets long—term
human evolution and biological differentiation of local populations in terms
of changes in gene frequency. This change is studied across time as well as
space. The study of mutation, selection, gene ﬂow, genetic drift and selec-
tive mating is affected by the physical environment in which the populations
lived, and continue to live. In fact, the physical and cultural environment
has a considerable impact upon the physical and genetic make-up of human
populations.
</p>

<p>
	There are various areas that are studied both by demographers and phys—
ical anthropologists. Some of these are as follows:
</p>

<p>
i. Inbreeding: Individuals who have common ancestors mating and
producing children. This affects the quality of population, and also
results in certain physical defects.

ii. Endogamous breeding: This refers to the selection of mates within
one’s own group. Social demographers are interested in intercaste,
interreligious and interracial marriages, which have both biological
and social effeCts.

iii. Associative mating: In a breeding population, when the mates have
more attributes in common than is expected by chance, it is called
positive associative mating. When mates have less in common than
is to be expected by chance, the system is called negative associative
mating. Both types of mating influence the progeny and their physi-
cal and mental characteristics. These influences are studied both by
demographers as well as by anthropologists.

iv. Mutation: Gene variations are based on the process of mutation.
Whenever mutation takes place, there is a change in the structure
of a gene, which may manifest itself as a change in entire popula-
tions, which is of interest to both demographers and physical
anthropologists.

v. Gene flow: Gene flow can result in a mixture of racial characteristics,
more in the case of out breeding where there are significant differ-
ences between individuals who mate. These changes may have sig-
nificant social ramifications, which are of interest to a demographer.

</p>

<p>
Cultural anthropology, an important branch of anthropology, is the study
of the origin and evolution of culture along with the physical evolution of
humankind. Demographers are interested in the influence of culture on
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00033">33</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:33
</h1>
<p>
  various demographic processes, such as fertility, mortality and migration.
The cultural environment in which a population lives affects even the com-
position of population. In fact, culture is seen to be the basis of differences
between communities and persons living under identical economic condi-
tions in a particular geographical location. These differences are manifested
as differences in languages spoken, values, customs and traditions, marriage
patterns, family types, child-rearing practices and so on. These differences
also affect fertility, mortality and migration. Since culture has a tremen-
dous impact upon human behaviour and action, it also affects demographic
behaviour and processes. Thus, demographic differences can, to a certain
extent, be explained in terms of cultural differences.
</p>

<p>
Population studies and demography are important for understanding
population dynamics and changes. Demography is considered to be a com-
prehensive study of populations. Most disciplines, whether the sciences or
social scienCes, make use of demographic data. Demography depends upon,
and also contributes to, various areas of study including genetics, econom-
ics, mathematics, sociology, economics, political science and various other
disciplines.
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY

. Since population is an integral part of the society, it is impor-
tant to have information about various aspects of the population.
Demography or population studies have evolved as an important dis-
cipline in the social sciences.

. Demography is a term derived from the two Greek words— demos,
meaning the people, and logos, which means to draw or write.

. Demography is a broad social science discipline concerned with the
study of human populations. In general, demographers deal with
the collection, presentation and analysis of data relating to the basic
life— cycle events and experiences of people. These are birth, mar-
riage, divorce, household and family formation, employment, ageing,
migration and death.

. The field of demography also covers broad topical studies of human
resources, health and morbidity, family systems and family structures,
the role of women, the value of children, and the social, cultural and
institutional context of demographic change.

. Demographic studies are as old as the society itself— it started when
human beings created civil society. People and societies across the
world have kept an account or records of the human population. With

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00034">34</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:34
</h1>
<p>
  the passage of time, societies started realizing the importance and
necessity of maintaining proper population records.
</p>

<p>
. The credit for starting demographic studies in modern times goes to
John Graunt, who initiated a new field of empirical research in popu-
lation studies. He stated that the processes of mortality, fertility and
migration were interrelated. William Petty contributed significantly
to the development of population studies. He studied population
growth, unemployment, urbanization, national income and so on.
William Halley constructed the first empirical life table.

. The history of the development of demography can be divided into
various phases: (i) The first phase is the Malthusian phase, in which
Robert Malthus gave his ideas on population growth. (ii) The sec-
ond phase saw considerable progress in the development of popu—
lation studies, due to the efforts of Joshua Milne, William Farr,
John Finlaison and Acille Guillard. (iii) The third phase witnessed
significant contributions from modern demographers such as Carr
Saunders, Arsene Dumont, Euler, Moser and Lokts, Walter Wilcox
and many others. Various organizations such as the UNO were
responsible for the development of demographic studies across the
world. (iv) The fourth phase witnessed the emergence of communist
population doctrine, which was influenced by the Marxian ideology.

. The discipline of demography studies three broad aspects of popula—
tion—size, composition and distribution. The scope of the discipline
can be categorized into narrow, broad and balanced.

. There is a close relationship between demography and various sci-
ences and social science disciplines. Analysis of demographic data is
based on the methodological sciences of mathematics and statistics.
Demographers depend upon social and biological sciences for explan—
atory frameworks in order to understand and explain the determinants
of demographic behaviour and population trends, and to explore their
relationship with wider trends in the society and in the economy.
Demography in turn influences biological and social sciences.

INTRODUCTION
	Demographic data refers to data and information on various aspects of a
population. Demographic or population data is necessary for making a
demographic profile of a country. It reveals the changes and trends in popu-
lation composition and distribution. It also helps in making predictions of
future increase or decrease or change in population. On the basis of pOpu-
lation data, birth and death rates and rate of migration and urbanization
are calculated. The data also brings out trends in these processes. It also
helps in measurement of social and economic characteristics. Demographic
data is also needed for comparing different populations and their charac-
teristics. The data also highlights various socio-economic problems such as
low literacy, especially female literacy, lower female sex ratio in the most
underdeveloped and developing countries, low female participation in the
workforce in many countries and so on.
  </p>

<p>
Demographic data has gained importance over the years, and there is
practically no field of study or activity that does not depend in some form or
the other on demographic and population data. The significance of popula-
tion data can be seen in its importance in the following fields:

i. Planning and administration
ii. Social and economic development
iii. Family planning and population control or increase

<p>
	iv. Measurement of social and economic characteristics

	V. Infrastructure, employment, health care facilities, literacy and
   	education

Over a period of time, countries across the world have evolved several pro—
cesses of collecting demographic data. Population data can be. collected
through different means. The following are the most important sources of
demographic data:

. Census
. Registration of vital events through vital registrations, population
  registers
. Sample surveys
 </p>

<p>
CENSUS

The word ‘census’ is derived from the Latin word censere, which means
to tax or to value. In fact, it refers to a system of taking inventories of
various segments of the population in order to identify those who could be
taxed, recruited for military service or forced to work. Thousands of years
ago, the Sumerians counted their citizens for taxation purposes. At differ—
ent periods of time, the Egyptians conducted inquiries into the occupations
of their people. The Greeks prepared electoral rolls, and the Romans based
conscription or recruitment on enumeration. These activities fulfilled the
functions that are performed by various governmental departments, such
as the income tax department, the defence services, the electoral registers
and the election commission in the modern state. The term census has been
defined as follows:

A modern population census may be defined as the total process of col—
lecting, compiling and publishing demographic, economic and social data
pertaining, at a specified time or times, to all persons of a defined territory.

     AcCording to‘ Mortimer Spiegelman (1955), “viewed as a whole, a census
involves four steps: (1) planning and preparation; (2) enumeration; (3) com-
pilation of data; and (4) analysis of the compilations and issue of reports.
These steps will be taken whether the census covers the entire population of a
nation or only some local segment.”

</p>
<h1>
    History of Census Operations
</h1>

  <p>
     Censuses have been taken since the ancient times by emperors and kings,
who tried to assess the size and strength of their territories. The early
censuses were conducted intermittently, and the- most important reasons
were to levy taxes or for military recruitment. Evidence in the form of clay
tablet fragments from the ancient Babylon indicates that a census was taken
there as early as 3800 BCE to estimate future tax revenues. Census operations
of some type were conducted in countries such as Babylon, Egypt, India,
China, Rome and Palestine in the ancient times. However, enumerations
did not take place at regular intervals until the Romans began a count of
their empire’s inhabitants, which was of the male population, and also for
assessment of property value. The information was used for drafting men
into military service and for taxing property.
</p>
  <p>
     With the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century CE, census took
a backseat for several hundred years. During the Middle Ages, the small
feudal states did not find it necessary to -conduct censuses. In 1086, William
the Conqueror compiled the Doomsday Book, which involved counting and
listing of English landowners and their holdings. This was done to deter-
mine revenues due to the king. On the basis of this record, the sOcial and
5 economic conditions of the times could be analyzed.

     During the reign of Ashoka, census operations were undertaken in
India. Kautilya's Arthashastra described the process. of collection of popula-

evidence of collection of population statistics during the reign of Akbar in
the sixteenth century.

    Features of Census
</h1>
<p>
    Hans Raj (2003) has listed out the following salient features of census:
i. Census is a national Stock—taking process, in which a nation gets
information about migration of people, their age, sex, occupation and
so on, and about people living in a country at a given point of time.
A nation also gets information about the social and economic condi -
tions of its citizens.

ii. Census is organiZed and conducted by the government, since it is a
mammoth task and cannot be undertaken effectively by any private
agency. This is especially true for a country that has vast geographical
area and a large population.

iii. In most countries, census is carried out at regular intervals. Since it is
   such a gigantic task, this is done once in a decade.

<p>
iv. Every country tries to ensure that census operations are completed
within a limited and specified period of time, and with the minimum
manpower and economic resources, though not at the cost of effi-
ciency or work.

v. Information collected through census should be of national use.

vi. The willingness and ability of the respondent to give information
 should be taken into consideration before proceeding with the work.
Questions that are likely to evoke fears and prejudices, and are diffi-
cult for the respondents to answer should be avoided in the question-
naires and schedules.

vii. During census operations, every effort is made to collect firsthand
information about every person. While collecting information, either
an individual or a family is considered a unit.
Census data is published, after the collected data has been authenti-
cally verified and properly analyzed.

ix. Before the actual census operations are carried out, certain prelimi-
nary steps are taken. These include identification of areas, collection
of information regarding households in a particular area, the form in
which information should be collected, the process of collection and
analysis of data. The questionnaire is pretested on a sample popula-
tion, and necessary modifications are made in the questions.

x. The census information is collected through personal contact.
Enumerators go to each household and collect on- the- spot informa-
tion. During the 1991 census, questionnaires were mailed to certain
categories of people such as professionals.

</p>
<p>
    According to United Nations, the census of population is defined in
United Nation document -Principles and Recommendations for National
Population Censuses (ST/ STAT/ SERM /27) as ‘the total process of collect-
ing, compiling and publishing demographic, economic and social data per—
taining, at a specified time or times to all persons in a country or delimited
territory. '

</p>
<p>
    Some of the essential features of the census are as follows:

Sponsorship: To conduct a census, vast organization and consider-
able resources are needed. The census organization has to mobilize
extensive administrative machinery with adequate legislative author—
ity. This can be done only by National Government with the coopera-
tion of states and the local population.

Defined territory: The population figures have no meaning
unless they refer to a well— defined territory. The territory cov-
ered, along with any changes in its area, in successiVe censuses

</p>

<p>
should. be clearly and explicitly stated. Individual enumeration
does not preclude the use of] sampling techniques fOr obtaining
data on specified characteristics, provided that the sample design
is consistent with the size of the areas for which the data are to
be tabulated and the degree of detail in the cross- tabulations to
be made.
</p>

. Compilation and publications: No census is complete unless the
data collected. is compiled and published by geographic areas and by
basic demographic variables. The unpublished data is of no use to the
potential users of the census data. That is why the census should be
limited to very important items which can be tabulated and published
on time.

<p>
. International simultaneity: The census of any country is of greater
value regionally, nationally and internationally, if it can be compared
with the censuses of other countries which are taken at approximately
the same time. Censuses in most countries of the world are conducted
in years ending in 0 or 1. In India, the decennial censuses are con-
ducted in years ending in 1.

</p>
<p>
     . Universality: Each person present and/ or residing within its scope,
without omission or duplication should be included in the census to
ensure completeness and accuracy of census data.

</p>
<p>
. Simultaneity: The total population enumerated should refer to one
well— defined point of time and the data collected should also refer to
a well— defined point or period of time. This is essential to an accu-
rate count of the total -population and relationship of facts about the
population to a specified period of time. As a general rule, a day is
fixed for the census and also a particular moment which is called
the ‘census moment’. In India, the ‘census moment’ now is the sun-
rise of 1 March of the census year. The fixing of the ‘census moment’
helps the enumerators to decide the people who are to be included in
the census. The people born after. the census moment or the people
dying before the census moment are to be excluded from the census.
Some of the characteristics of the population like age, marital status,
occupation, literacy, birthplace, etc. are referred to a period of time
usually from 10 February to 28 February of the census year to ensure
simultaneity.

</p>
<p>
    . Defined periodicity: Censuses should be taken at regular intervals so
that comparable information is made available in a fixed sequence.
A series of censuses makes it possible to appraise the past, accurately
describe the present and estimate the future.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00042">42</pagenum>
   <h1>
     page no : 42
</h1>

<p>
  . Individual Units: Census data must be collected separately fOr each
individual so that detailed classifications may be provided in all the
required combinations. A procedure of ‘group enumeration’ is not a
census in the strict sense of the term because the recording of aggre—
gated or summarized information on the characteristics of a group
of person usually precludes the cross- tabulation of data  on several
characteristics Even though a well- designed ‘group enumeration’
can produce cross —classifications of certain individual characteristics,
such as sex and age, the possibilities in this respect are so limited that
the procedure is not recommended for general use, particularly since
it tends to result in under- enumeration of the International compa-
rability is thus maintained. The Indian census accompanies all the
above features.
</p>

 <p>
    As a part of an integrated programme of data collection, the popu-
lation census is the primary source of basic national population
data required for administrative purposes and for many aspects of
economic and social research and planning. The value of the census results
is increased if they can be employed together with the results of other
investigations, as in the use of the census data as a base of benchmark for
current statistics. The usefulness of the census is also enhanced if it can
furnish the information needed for conducting other statistical investiga-
tions. It can, for example, provide a statistical frame for other censuses and
sample surveys. The purpose of a continuing programme of data collection
can best be served, therefore, if the relationship between the population
census and other statistical investigations is considered when census plan—
ning is under way and if provision is made for facilitating the use of the
census and its results in connexion with intercensal sample surveys, with
continuous population registers, with other types of censuses and with
civil registration and vital statistics, and with labor force, educational and
similar statistics. The use of consistent concepts and definitions through-
out an integrated programme of data collection is essential if the advan—
tages of these relationships are to be fully realized.
</p>

<p>
    One of India's great national leaders, the late Shri Govind Ballabh Pant,
said of the census as follows:

 In fact in these days you cannot take up any serious administrative, eco-
nomic or social work without referring to the Census Report which is an
essential part of every enquiry, of every study. Even for solution of minor
problems you have often to consult the Census Reports.

Stages in Collection and Compilation of Census Data , page no : 43
</h1>
<p>

There’ are several stages involved in the census process. These are as
follows:

Determining the Contents

In the first stage, it is important to determine the information that should
be collected or omitted. In general, information is collected on the following
aspects:

. Geographical

. Personal

. Economic

. Culture

. Education

. Fertility

. Other Information
</p>

<p>
    It is important to ensure that the. data collected is accurate, for which the fol—
lowing should be ensured (Hans Raj 2003):

. Proper definition of all terms

. Proper training of enumerators

. Creating a climate, in which people are ready to provide information

. Information to be collected is not time consuming VA
 . Avoiding information on purely personal and private matters

. Confidentiality of the collected information

. Information to be collected is manageable

. Each enumerator gets sufficient time to complete the work

. Make provisions for checking accuracy of information given by the
respondents
</p>

 <h1>
Developing the Census Schedule
</h1>

<p>
    After deciding the type of information to be collected, the next stage is
the development of the census schedule. The schedule should be such that
maximum information can be collected in the shortest possible time. The
wording of the questions should be such that the ansWers provide infor-
mation on more than one point. The questions should elicit clear, precise
and brief answers. All questions should be sequenced in such a way that

<p>
answers to one will become a link to the next one. Questions eliciting sharp
or emotional reactions, or those embarrassing the respondents should be
avoided. Questions should be such that the respondents do not have to
think much. Open- ended questions should be avoided as far as possible.
The language used should be simple and understandable. The UNO has
given certain guidelines and published questionnaires that are being used
by countries across the world.
</p>

 <h1>
    Division of Work
</h1>
<p>
     Before beginning the actual census operations, the country should be
divided into regions and subregions. India is divided into states, districts,
tehsils, towns, cities, villages and localities. Each of these units is put under
the charge of a supervisor, who is assisted by field workers. The necessary
stationery and questionnaires are provided to each unit.

</p>
 <h1>
    Propaganda
</h1>

<p>
    Adequate propaganda should be given for census operations before the
actual process begins. NeWspapers, TV posters, advertisement hoardings,
cinema slides, pamphlets, street plays, etc. are used to give publicity for the
census process. The importance and significance of census information is
emphasized, as is the obligation of the people in imparting information.

</p>

<h1>
Household Survey
</h1>
<p>
    A few months before the commencement of census operations, a household
survey is undertaken. Every area is divided into localities, and in every local-
ity each house is counted. On the basis of the previous census information,
it is determined whether new areas have come up, and migration of and
changes in population in population are taken note of.

</p>
<h1>
 Pretesting of Questionnaire
</h1>

<p>
    The questionnaire used at the time of census is pretested. The questions are
put to selected persons at random to ascertain Whether they communicate
the meaning they are intended to, or whether different people can interpret
them differently. In India, these questionnaires are translated into several
regional languages, which are pretested.

</p>
<h1>
     Training
</h1>

<p>
    Census is a complex process, and the staff dealing with the operations should
be properly trained. They should have knowledge about administering ques-
tionnaires, and should be sufficiently informed about the areas they will be
working in, the conveniences, preferences and habits of the people.

one night, a very large number of well- trained and well- qualified
enumerators and field workers are required. It may not always
be possible to have such a large group of well- trained workers,
and as a result, data may be collected by less trained and incom-
petent field workers. This may affect the accuracy of the data
collected.

iii. The limited- time may force the authorities to limit the number of
questions to be asked. This hinders the process of rectification of
inaccuracies and mistakes. It is also not easy to calculate the percent-
age of errors.

iv. The limited time may force the enumerators and the respondents to
hurry, which may result in inaccuracy and mistakes.

v. Since census operations are usually conducted once in a decade, if
such an operation has to be completed within one night, it may not
always be possible to collect the maximum amount of information
through the de facto method.

vi. Under this method, there are no provisions for counterchecks, and
therefore the mistakes may not be easily identified.

vii. During nights, people usually prefer to rest after a hard day’s work.
They may be tired, and despite the appeals made by the census author-
ities, may not welcome enumerators. The respondents may not be in
a mood to provide accurate information, and may rebuff the enu-
merators. Even for the enumerators, the field workers and the super-
visory staff, the night time may not be a convenient or welcome time.

 V. The UNO feels that every country should conduct census operations
in years which are nearest to ‘0’ (such as 60, 70, 80 and so on). This is
becauSe if counting of populations is done nearly simultaneously in
all countries across the world, it is possible to develop international
standards and comparisons in population studies.

<h1>
    Census in India
</h1>

<p>
    Once in a decade, the Government of India conducts census operations in
the country. The Indian Census is the most comprehensive single source of
authentic and reliable information about the. country and its people. The ear-
liest attempt to count the people was made during 1867—1872. The counting
was neither systematic nor did it cover the entire country. It Was a partial
census, and not much information could be collected. It was, however, con-
sidered an auspicious beginning to the process of census in the country. The
next synchronous (occurring or ”existing at the same time or having the same
period or phase) and mOre comprehensive census was undertaken in 1881.
Since then, every 10 years census operations are undertaken in the country.
   The earlier census officials and enumerators were government officials,
and people were apprehensive about them. Their motives for collecting infor-
mation were doubted. Taking into account the magnitude and complexity of
the census data, the Indian census authorities did a commendable job of col-
lecting and analyzing population data. Till the 1931 census, the method used
for collecting data in the country was the de facto method or the ‘one night
enumeration system’. Though the method was less expensive, it had several
defects. With the 1931 census, the de jure method was put to use in the country.
</p>

V. The UNC) feels that every country should conduct census operations
in years which are nearest to ‘0’ (such as 60, 70, 80 and so on). This is
becauSe if counting of populations is done nearly simultaneously in
all countries across the world, it ispossible to develop international
standards and comparisons in population studies.

Census in India

Once in a decade, the Government of India conducts census operations in
the country. The Indian Census is the most comprehensive single source of
authentic and reliable information about the.country and its people. The ear-
liest attempt to count the people was made during 1867—1872. The counting
was neither systematic nor did it cover the entire country. It Was a partial
census, and not much information could be collected. It was, however, con-
! sidered an auspicious beginning to the process of census in the country. The
next synchronous (occurring or ”existing at the same time or having the same
period or phase) and mOre comprehensive census was undertaken in 1881.
Since then, every 10 years census operations are undertaken in the country.
The earlier census ofﬁcials and enumerators were government oﬂicials,

and people were apprehensive about them. Their motives for collecting infor-
mation were doubted. Taking into account the magnitude and complexity of
the census data, the Indian census authorities did a commendable job of col-
lecting and analysing population data. Till the 1931 census, the method used
for collecting data in the country was the de facto method or the ‘one night
enumeration system’. Though the method was less expensive, it had several
defects. With the 1931 census, the de jure method was put to use in the country.
The Government of India realized the signiﬁcance and importance of
census, and the Census Act was passed, which provided for the appoint-
ment of a Census Commissioner in India. Today, each state has a Census
Superintendent, who is assisted by District census authorities and bloc
, _ authorities. Both ofﬁcial and non-ofﬁcial individuals, institutions and orga-
nizations are associated with census operations. There is permanent as well
as temporary staff for census Work. The temporary staff are usually appointed

during actual census operations, and are properly trained for the work.

    1981 Census
</h1>
<p>

The 1981 census was conducted between 9 February and 5 March 1981. The
data showed an increase of approximately 25 per cent in India’ s population
over 1971 census. The reason for this increase was attributed to the steep
fall in death rates, due to improved health conditions, control over diseases,
and a general improvement in the economic conditions of the people. The
data also showed that there was an increase in the density of population.
The female sex ratio (number of females per 1000 males) Was 935, and Kerala
had a positive female sex ratio of 1034. The data also revealed that nearly
half the males and approximately 75 per cent of the females in the country
were illiterate. The male literacy rate was approximately 47 per cent, and the
female literacy was approximately 25 per cent.

Before the actual census work was started, a comprehensive questionnaire
was prepared after detailed discussions. It was pretested before being put to
use. It consisted of the following aspects:

i. The house list: House listing and house numbering operations were
conducted as a preliminary to census operations. Each residential and
non-residential house was numbered» and a house list was prepared.
To help in the process of house listing, national maps and layout
charts of all villages and towns were prepared.

ii. Household schedule: The household schedule was reintroduced
in the 1981 census, and has been in use since then. The data col—
lected in the household schedule includes information on certain
aspects such as housing conditions, sources of drinking water,
availability of electricity, the number of married couples living
in the household, if any land is being cultivated and so on.
Details of the residents of the household, such as age, sex, marital
status, literacy status, relationship of each individual with the
head of the household and so on are also a part of the household
schedule.

iii. Individual slip: The individual slip is an important part of the census
questionnaire, and with its help, information on each member of the
household is collected.

    The census is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs. A senior
IAS officer is appointed as the Census Commissioner, and is assisted by
other officers and a large number of .enumerators. In the states and union
territories, Director of Census Operations looks after census work, with the
assistance of the, local staff.

</p>
 <p>
      During the 1991 census, the country was divided into urban and rural
areas. The meanings of concepts such as work, major and marginal workers,
cultivators, agricultural labor and household industry were clarified. The
household schedule included information about residents of the household,
their relationship with the head of the household, their age, sex, marital
status, occupation, education and literacy status, and so on. The individual
slip consisted of 23 items, in which personal information was collected. This
included the following:

. Name, age, sex, relationship with head of family.

. Details of place of birth and last residence.

. Mother tongue and other languages known.

. Marital status —married/ unmarried, age at marriage, number of
  surviving children, number of children born alive and their sex.

. Religipn and whether belonging to SC/ ST, and its name.

. Literacy status and educational attainment.

. Economic information— employed/ employer, main activity, nature of
	work and class of worker.

. Reasons for migration from place of last residence.
</p>

<p>
    Several changes were made in the 1991 census compared with the previous
aw ones. The house list included information related to housing and household
- amenities, including the type of fuel used for cooking and the sanitation facil-
ities. Individual slip information was also collected about ex- servicemen and
their status as pensioners. The questions on seeking /available for work were
asked only for the non- workers and not for the marginal workers. Schedules
and instructions for filling them up were translated into regional languages.

been computerized, though this has been done in a more systematic way in
the 2001 census. This census enumerated the disabled people in the country,
for the first time making available authentic figures on disability.
</p>
 <p>
     The census was conducted in two phases. The first phase consisted of
house listing operations, and included information on housing conditions,

     Roughly, 20 lakh enumerators and supervisors were employed to
collect information on every individual person present in the country
during the enumeration period (i .e., 9—28 February 2001). The 2001 census
was an enormous task undertaken, involving 2 million enumerators, cover-
ing 650,000 villages, 5,500 towns and a large number of cities. It involved
collection of crucial demographic and socio-economic data concerning over
a billion people.
</p>

 <p>
      The second phase covered canvassing or getting information on gen-
eral and socio-cultural characteristics, including religion, mother tongue,
languages known, literacy and educational status, characteristics of work-
ers and non- -workers, migration characteristics and fertility particulars. For
the first time, information on disabilities was collected. This included the
following five types of disabilities.

i. Disability in vision
ii. Disability in sense of hearing
iii. Disability in speech
iv. Disability in movement
v. Mental disability.
</p>
<p>
    Information was also collected on distance travelled to place of work and
mode of travel, migration after birth, level of education and type of institu-
tion attended.

    Housing Census 2001
</h1>

<p>
    Before starting the census operations, the process of house listing starts, in
which each house is properly numbered and a list of houses in every locality is
prepared. This list 18 handed over to the enumerators at the time of collection
of data, to ensure that all the houses 1n the locality are covered under census.
Along with a list of houses, additional information about the state of housing,
the number of people residing in each house, the amenities and the facilities
available are also collected. House listing operation is an important precursor
to the exercise of undertaking the decennial population census. One of the
purposes of house listing operations is to identify each building, structure
and place to find out its usage— residential, non-residential or any other pur-
pose —so as to enable drawing up a frame for the population census, which
follows this exercise. The cardinal principle is to cover the entire country— its
plains, hills, deserts, forests, islands, rivers, etc.— on a systematic basis, so as
to avoid missing out any area or house at the time of population enumeration.

    The House Listing Operations of the Census 2001 .saw a major shift
in emphasis— towards the quality of living of households rather than just
housing. The change in emphasis has been made keeping in view the rec-
ommendations made by the United Nations on the broad aspects to be cov-
ered during a census enquiry. The data on various aspects of quality of living
brought out by the ‘Housing Census 2001’ has become significant, as it is the
first census of the twenty- first century. There are several new features in the
House- listing Schedule of the 2001 census. Several improvements have been
made in the format of the House- listing Schedule. The scope of enquiry of the
House- listing Schedule was considerably expanded with the inclusion of new
questions. There was an increase in the number of items on which informa-
tion was collected, from 22 in 1991 to 33 in 2001. House less households were
not included in the House List Schedule. Data on particulars of amenities and
assets were not collected while canvassing (getting the opinions (of people) by
asking specific questions) the house list. Almost all the questions in the House
List Schedule had precoded numeric options. This not only helped enumera-
tors to record the response easily, but also facilitated quick data processing.

<h1>
    Census Errors
</h1>

<p>
    In any large— scale statistical operation such as the decennial census, human
W as well as machine -related errors occur. These errors are commonly referred
I to. as non- sampling errors. Such errors include not enumerating every
household or every person in the population, not obtaining all required
information from the respondents, obtaining incorrect or inconsistent
information, and recording information incorrectly. In addition, errors
can occur during the field review of the enumerators’ work, during clerical
W handling of the census questionnaires, or during the electronic processing
of the questionnaires. Some census errors are as follows:

i. Errors of enumeration: Inaccuracy in the total number of persons
enumerated. Over a period of time, these errors have been reduced to
a low level in most countries that have held censuses for many years.

ii. Errors made by respondents: These errors refer to the inaccuracies A
in the responses given by the respondents. These generally include
incorrect information regarding age, income and number of children.

iii. Errors in age structure of a population: Age is generally rounded
off to either the last or next year, a common error known as ‘digit
preference’ or ‘age heaping’. This results in crowding of data in cer-
tain age categories. Another common error is inaccurate informa-
tion regarding income, and respondents usually give a lower income -
figure than they actually earn. This is usually due to a fear that
the government will use the information given to tax the income.

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00056">56</pagenum>

<h1>
     page no : 56
</h1>
<p>
Inaccurate information 18 also given about the number of children,
and usually the number 13 decreased.

 iv. Errors in accuracy: Respondents may give inaccurate responses due
to fear of reprisal from the concerned authorities, concerns about the
confidentiality of the census information, lack of interest and at times
even lack of proper or accurate or proper knowledge, especially in rural
areas where illiteracy- is rampant. Public understanding, support, and
cooperation are of utmost importance for any census to be success-
ful . Apprehensions about government interferenCe with private life can
prevent people from cooperating with an essentially voluntary count-
ing process. People may be suspicious of giving infOrmation to a gov—
ernment agency, and also feel that particular census questions invade
their privacy. They also fear that responses may fall into wrong hands.

  v. Bias and inaccuracy in the statement of occupation: The variety and
complexity of modern employments and industrial processes neces-
sitate the devotion of considerable attention, in censuses in developed
countries, to the framing of questions about OCCupation. One of the
commonest errors arises, however, from a very human weakness: a
tendency to overstate the importance of their occupation.

 vi. Coverage errors: There are two general categories of coverage
errors —enumeration errors (persons enumerated in error) and omis-
sions (persons erroneously not enumerated). Census coverage error,
which is non- sampling error, can be introduced at various stages of
data collection and processing. Response error, interviewer error, and
procedural and design errors all contribute to the total error.

 vii. Interviewer or enumerator errors: These errors can be the result of
enumerator bias, lack of proper procedural knoWledge or inadequate
or improper training. Overlooking some households or counting
some households more than once can also result in enumerator errors.

 viii. Errors of tabulation: Errors in tabulating the collected data
were common in the earlier censuses, since people did tabulation
manually. With the use of the electronic means for tabulation, the
margin for error has decreased considerably.

  ix .Errors in analyses: The Census Bureau uses sound analytical tech-
niques to ensure objectivity in its statistical information products. We
evaluate the techniques used to analyze data, continually searching
for more effective, accurate and reliable analysis tools. We evaluate
and report on the quality of our analysis, specifically.

x. Misunderstanding a question or failing to answer all the questions:
Another common problem found in the census records, is that even
when everyone in a household is listed with the same surname, some

<p>
    of them might have had different surnames, but due to some error
(either originally, or in the copy), the differing surname was not noted.

</p>
<p>
To reduce various types of non- sampling errors, a number of techniques are
implemented during the planning, development of the mailing address list,
data collection and data processing activities. As far as possible, accuracy
is maintained, and methods that are qualitatively sound are used through-
out the data collection and processing phases of the census to improve the
quality of the data. Some countries use a reinterview programme that is
designed to minimize the errors in the data collection phase for enumerator—
filled questionnaires. Enumerator errors, spelling errors or incorrect data
may contribute to inaccurate records, but every possible effort is made to
provide a correct listing. Human errors incurred at the time of enumeration
and at the compilation of an index may result in misspellings, undercounts,
overcounts, false information, missing years and records, and boundary
confusion However, crosschecking of data can minimize these errors.

In simple random sampling, each member of a population has an equal
chance of being included in the sample. Also, each combination of mem-
bers of the population has an equal chance 0f composing the sample. These
two properties define simple random sampling. To select a simple random
sample, one needs to list all of the units in the survey population. Simple
random sampling is the easiest method of sampling and it is the most com-
monly used. Advantages of this technique are that it does not require any
additional information on the frame (such as geographic areas) other than
the complete list of members of the survey population along with informa-
tion for contact. Also, since simple random sampling is a simple method and
the theory behind it is well established, standard formulas exist to determine
the sample size, the estimates and so on, and these formulas are easy to use.
Random sampling aims to overcome in-built bias by making sure that any
member of the population is as likely to be chosen in the sample as any other.

<h1>
    Systematic Sampling

<p>
    In this method, the sample is chosen in accordance with a systematic plan.
For example, every tenth item or member in a population is chosen for
the purpose of collecting information. Sometimes, called interval sampling,
systematic sampling means that there is a gap, or interval, between each
selected unit in the sample.

     Stratified Sampling
</h1>

<p>
     A population is divided into a number of strata, and from each stratam, a
particular number is. chosen as sample. Used by researchers to eliminate
bias in the sample, stratified sampling involves dividing the target popula-
tion into strata or groups, which are linked by some characteristics such
as socio-economic features. Using stratified sampling, the population is
divided into homogeneous, mutually exclusive groups called strata, and then
independent samples are selected from each stratum. The main reason for
dividing the population into strata is that it can make the sampling strategy
more efficient.

    Cluster Sampling

<p>

Used when the population is not known, cluster Sampling involves a mix-

expensive to spread a sampler across the population as a whole. Travel costs
can become expensive if interviewers have to survey people from one end of
the country to the other. To reduce costs, statisticians may choose a cluster
sampling technique. Cluster sampling divides the population into groups or

sampling, where some units are selected from each group.

<h1>
    Multistage Sampling
</h1>

<p>
    Multistage sampling is a sampling that is done in several stages in order to
minimize cost and effort. It is like the cluster method, except that it involves
picking a sample from within each chosen cluster, rather than including all
units in the cluster. This type of sampling requires at least two stages. In the
first stage, large groups or clusters are identified and selected. These clusters
contain more population units than are needed for the final sample.

</p>
  <p>
    In the second stage, population units are picked from within the selected -
clusters (using any of the possible probability "sampling methods) for a final
sample. If more than two stages are used, the process of choosing population
units within clusters continues until there is a final sample.

<h1>
     Sample Design

<p>
Once the objectives, guidelines and definitions have been worked out, the
statistician can work on the survey plan. The survey plan is divided into
three parts:

. Sample design: How the sample will be collected.

. Estimation techniques: How the results from the sample will be
extended to the whole population.
. Measures of precision: How the sampling error will be measured.

    The following steps are needed to select a sample and ensure that the

<p>
    Deﬁne the target population— The target population is the total pop-
ulation for which the information is required. The units that make up
the population must be described in terms of characteristics that clearly
identify them. The survey population or the target population must be
defined early in the survey— designing process. This is the population for
which information is required. However, some members of the popula-
tion have to be excluded because of operational constraints: the high
cost of collecting data in some remote areas, the difficulty of identifying
and contacting certain components of the target population, etc.

Specifically, the target population is defined by the following
characteristics:

. Nature of data required.

. Geographic location: The geographic boundaries of the population
have to be determined, as well as the level of geographic details
required for the survey estimate (by province, by city, etc.).

. Reference period: The time period covered by the survey.

Other characteristics, such as socio-demographic characteristics
(interest in a particular age group, for example) or type of indUstry.

</p>
<p>
     Survey frame: The survey frame, also called the sampling frame, is
the tool used to gain access to the population. There are two types of
frames: list frames and area frames. A list frame is just a list of names
and addresses that provide direct access to ‘individuals’ (e. g., a list of
hospitals, a list of restaurants," a list of students at a university, etc.). Area
frames are a list of geographic areas that provide indirect access to indi—
viduals (e. g., the neighborhoods in a city). This type of access is called
indirect because first, a list of geographic areas must be selected and
then, access to individuals within each selected area must be worked out.

</p>
<p>
    Sample size: The level of precision needed for the survey estimates
will impact the sample size. However, it is not as easy to determine the
sample size as one may think. Generally, the actual sample size of a
survey is a compromise between the levels of precision to be achieved,
the survey budget and any other operational constraints, such as bud-
get and time. In order to achieve a certain level of precision, the sample
size will depend, among other things, on the following factors:

. The variability of the characteristics being observed: If every person
in a population had the same salary, a sample of one person would
be all you need to estimate the average salary of the population. If
the salaries are very different, you need a bigger sample in order to
produce a reliable estimate.

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00061">61</pagenum>

<h1>
     page no : 61
</h1>

<p>
    . The population size: To a certain extent ,the bigger the population,
the bigger the sample needed. However, once you reach a certain
level, an increase in population no longer affects the sample size.
For instance, the necessary sample size to achieve a certain level of
precision will be about the same for a population of 1 million as for
a population twice that size.

. The sampling and estimation methods: Not all sampling and estima-
tion methods have the same level of efficiency. You need a bigger
sample if your method, is not the most efficient. However, because
of operational constraints and the unavailability of an adequate
frame, you cannot always use the most efficient technique.

</p>
<p>
    v. Decide on the data to be collected: The data requirements of the
survey must be established. To ensure that. the requirements are
operationally sound, the necessary data terms and definitions also
need to be determined.

</p>
<p>
vi. Set the level of precision: There is a level of uncertainty associated
with estimates coming from a sample. Sample- to- sample variation is
what causes the sampling error. Statisticians can estimate the sam-
pling error associated with a particular sampling plan, and try to
minimize it. When designing a survey, the acceptable level of uncer-
tainty in the survey estimates has to be established. This level depends
on what the end use of the results will be and on the size of the overall
budget. The level of uncertainty will also be determined by the sample
size. Increasing the sample size- will. decrease the sampling error.

<h1>
    Survey  Type
</h1>
<p>
    There are four main types of surveys:

  i. Postal surveys are a relatively inexpensive ways of reaching a large
number of people. Though in principle, the entire population can be
reached by post, in practice however, not many people respond unless
there is a strong incentive for them to act. For. this reason, postal
surveys are prone to bias.
  ii. Telephone surveys are also comparatively cheap to operate.
Interviewers can reach a large area very quickly, without the need
to travel long distances. The main drawback is that despite the
near universal coverage of the phone network and phone owner-
ship, many people cannot be reached easily over the phone. Also,
increasing numbers of phone customers are choosing not to list their
numbers. There is a strong possibility that Without checks to correct
these points, the phone survey may prove to be unrepresentative.

</p>

<p>
 iii. Face- to- face surveys allow for a more intensive questioning and
response method to be practised. Surveys aimed at delving into the
reasons for certain attitudes will often use this method. However, it can
be a very costly method, if a large geographical area is being sampled.

  iv. Electronic surveys are increasingly common and can be expected
to continue as greater online coverage of the population is achieved.
Typically, the findings of electronic surveys are raw (giving, e. g.,
number of people watching a TV programme, or number of ‘hits’
to a Web site) and these are augmented by telephone surveys to
find out the socio—economic background of the sample population.

    Advantages of Sampling Surveys

</h1>

<p>
      There are several advantages of sampling surveys. Some of them are as
follows:
 i. It is less expensive than the census.

ii. It is less time- consuming.

iii. The number of people engaged in sample surveys is comparatively
less, and it is, therefore, possible to get the required number of trained
and qualified persons.

iv. It can be used as a complementary method of collecting information,
so that trends of population can be known.

v. Since census is conducted once in five or ten years, information on
various aspects of population in the intervening period can be got
through regular sample surveys.

vi. At the time of census, some information is deliberately not collected,
since it is felt that the time for collecting such information is insuffi—
cient. Such information is generally collected through sample surveys.


vii. The census is broad based and a large- scale procedure that covers the
entire population of a country. Sample surveys are in- depth studies
that cover a particular aspect and limited area/ number of people,
and therefore the quality of information gathered is better.

viii. It is not possible to collect information on various aspects of pop-
ulation, such as fertility, birth control measures, unemployment,
self- employment schemes and so on, during census. Such informa-
tion is collected through sample surveys. </p>

register and filling up data gaps and verification of authenticity of available
data. A system of collecting data between each census period was started,
and the National Sample Surveys came into use. Various aspects of popula-
tion such as fertility rate, infant mortality, age- specific death rates, gender
differentials in death rates, family planning and its awareness and adoption,
migrations, employment and so on were studied through National Sample
Surveys (NSS). The main objective of the National» Sample Survey is to
collect data on important socio-economic aspects of the country’ s popula-
tion by using the technique of sample survey. The National Sample Survey
(NSS) was initiated in the year 1950. It is a nationwide survey operation, con-
ducted in the form of successive rounds. It was established to ﬁll up data gaps
for socio-economic planning .and policy making through sample surveys.
In March 1970, the structure of NSS was reorganized to bring all aspects
of its work under a single Government organization, under the overall direc-
tion of a Governing Council. This was done to impart objectivity and auton-
omy in the collection, processing and publication of the NSS data. This new
organization was called the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO).

    An important method of collecting population data is the registration
method. This method started during the nineteenth century, when it was
made mandatory to register births, deaths and marriages. Earlier, reli—
gious authorities used to register vital life events of their followers. Such
information was useful for population analysis. Sweden took the lead as
early as in 1848 by initiating a form of registration of, births. During 1874,
non- registration of births was made a punitive offence and in 1926 registra—
tion of deaths was made compulsory in England and Wales. In the United
States of America, formal registration of vital events began only in 1946.

<p>
should be properly reported as and when they occur for proper recording
of vital events. In many developed countries such as the United States of
America, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Canada, Australia, Japan
and New Zealand, the vital or civil registration system has been perfected.
However, in many developing countries such as India, Thailand, Burma,
Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh and others, a sizable number of births, deaths,
marriages, and other vital events are not reported. There are three main terms
associated with this method of population collection. These are as follows:

i. Vital events: Human beings entry into the world (by birth), and their
departure from it (by death) are vital events which mark the begin-
ning and end of their lives. During their life span (birth to death),
changes may take place in their civil condition or marital status
through marriage, divorce, separation or adoption. Events resulting
in changes in an individual’s civil status are also called Vital events.

ii. Vital records: Vital records record vital events such as births,
stillbirths, adoption, deaths, marriages, separation and divorce. Such
vital events are reported to the appropriate authorities. Parents report
the occurrence of births, family members report deaths, and mar-
riage / divorces are reported by individuals themselves, and at times by
members of their family.

iii. Vital statistics: In every society, vital events such as births, deaths,
marriages, adoption and divorces occur continuously, and these are
continually recorded. Vital registration system refers to the recording
or registration of Vital events. The compilation of such registered vital
events is called vital statistics.

</p>
<p>
    The system of  registration of vital statistics has a long history. In most
European countries, the Church was directly involved in the registration of
births and deaths. In the Middle Ages, ecclesiastical authorities were respon-
sible for the registration of Vital events among the Christians. In 1538, based
on an order of Thomas Cromwell, the Clergy of England was made to record
baptisms, weddings and burials. Systematic parish registers were maintained
in Canada, Finland and Denmark in the seventeenth century. However,
these records. had certain drawbacks. The ecclesiastical records were specific
to particular religious groups and did not cover the entire population. The
quality of records were also not the best, since ceremonies of baptism, wed-
dings and burials were recorded rather than the actual biological or social
events such as births, deaths and marriages.
</p>
 <p>
     The Incas of Peru were the first to introduce a system of registration of
births, deaths and marriages under civil authorities independent of religious
organizations such as the Church. Later, civil registration was introduced in
the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and New Plymouth in the United States,

</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00065">65</pagenum>

<p>
where the government officials were made responsible for registrations, and
the events of births, deaths, marriages and adoption were recorded rather
than the ceremonies associated with them. This started the process of secu-
larization of Vital registrations, through which registration of Vital events
were made independent of the control of religion.

</p>
 <p>
      The Napoleonic Code, adopted in France in 1804, was associated with
the individual’s ‘legal and civil rights’. Civil rights were granted by the State
on the basis of the proof official registration, which were in the form of certif-
icates of births, deaths and marriages issued when such events were reported
to the concerned authorities. In. the nineteenth century, other European and
South American countries adopted the system of civil registrations, and the
national governments had the responsibility of the registration of vital events.
In 1662, John Graunt became the first individual to use vital records for sta-
tistical purposes. In his work, National and Political Observation Made upon
the Bills of Mortality, he incorporated the first modern use of the informa-
tion on fertility, mortality and migration. Several European countries started
making use of vital registration data for studying population. William Farr
was made ‘compiler of Abstracts’ in the General Register Office of England
in 1839, and devoted a substantial part of his service to developing a national
system of vital statistics. There were several studies on mortality and health
conditions in England, which drew the attention of the people towards vari-
ous health problems, and various measures were adopted for their improve-
ment. The registration of vital events is a system that is regarded as a current,
continuous, compulsory and permanent recording system of vital events
and their characteristics.

<h1>
    Uses and Advantages of Registration of Vital Statistics
</h1>

 <p>
    Registration and compilation of vital events and statistics have several uses
and advantages, some of which are as follows:

i. After a vital event is reported and registered, a certificate is issued
  to the concerned person. On the basis of the event registered, the
certificate may be a birth, death, adoption or marriage certificate. The
birth certificate establishes a person’s nationality or citizenship, legal
proof of a person for establishing family relationships and for settling
issues of inheritance or insurance. A death certificate is needed for
disposal of a dead body, and for settling claims of insurance or inheri-
tance. Marriage certificate is needed to establish the marital status of a
person and the legitimacy of children born.

ii. The vital registration system provides important statistical data on
	births, deaths, marriage, divorces and so On.

iii. Data can be used for population estimation and population projections.

</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00066">66</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
iv. Information on the causes of death has contributed to the advance—
	ment of medical sciences

v. Planning and evaluation of public health programmes can be based
   on an analysis of mortality statistics.

vi. Vital statistics are used by planners and administrators of public
   health, infrastructure planning, educational facilities, provision of
   food supplies and so on.

vii. The birth and death rates reflect the social, economic and health con-
 	ditions of a society.

viii. Vital registration information helps in evaluating the effectiveness of
  	the ongoing family planning programme.

</p>
<h1>
    Defects of Vital Registration
</h1>
<p>
    The Vital registration system has Certain defects, some of which are as follows:

  i. There are no full -time employees involved in this work. Officials
involved in this work are expected to take up this work in addition to
their normal duties and responsibilities, which is sometimes consid-
ered an additional burden.

 ii. In a country like India, there are no separate departments to deal with
population data.
 iii. There are no punitive measures for non- registration of Vital events in
many countries, including India.

 iv. The data collected may not always be correct. It is possible that those
who give the information for recording are not directly connected
to the individuals about whom they are giving information, or that
in rural areas, ignorance and illiteracy is responsible for inaccurate
information.

v. Even today, the scope of the registration system is limited, and empha-
   sis is on births and deaths.

</p>


<h1>
    Suggestions for Improving the Registration Method
</h1>

<p>
    Hans Raj (2003) has given the following suggestions for the improvement of
registration method:

  i. There should be a uniform system of registration. Vital Statistics Act
should be passed which makes it compulsory to record or register
vital events.

  ii. A house list should be prepared for the entire country to enable access
to information on vital events.

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00067">67</pagenum>
 	<h1>
     page no : 67
</h1>
<p>
    iii. A single organization should be made responsible for the registration
of information on births and deaths in order to maintain uniformity.

  iv. Registration work should not be assigned to persons who are expected
to do it in addition to their normal responsibilities and duties. The
work should be made a priority, and a separate organization should
be made responsible for it.

 v. Annual sample survey of at least 1 per cent population should be car-
ried out in order to know the annual trends of population.

 vi. Information on death should have a classification of the causes of
death, including violence, Injury, childbirth, complicated pregnancy,
fever, infant death or other important causes.

 vii. Field workers should be given proper training to collect relevant
information.

 viii. People should be educated on the importance of vital statistics, and
give correct information on all vital events.

 ix. The heads of the families should be given a certificate as proof that
information about their families has been registered, and that they
are in a position to get benefits that accrue to them out of such a
certificate.

</p>
<h1>
    Civil Registrations In India
</h1>

<p>
The British introduCed the system of registration of vital events in India
during the mid- nineteenth century. The administrators began to realize the
importance of registration of vital events, especially the causes of death, since
the death rate in India was considerably- high as  a result of appalling public
health and sanitary conditions. The Bengal Births and Deaths Registration
Act of 1873, which was later adopted by Bihar and Orissa, was the first- act
that formalized the process. of  registration of vital events. The legal neces-
sity of the registration of births and deaths slowly began to be used as evi-
dence in courts of law. In 1886, the Government of India enacted the Births,
Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, though this act made registration of
vital events purely voluntary. About 80 per cent of the population of India
was covered by the registration system by 1903, though the quality and cov-
erage of data was not good. Several commissions were set up which tried
to improve the scope and quality of vital statistics in the country. With the
Second World War, the system of registration came to a complete standstill.
It was only after 1951 that the problem of rapid population increase was
recognized, and a need was felt to have accurate information on the growth
rate of population, for the purposes of planning and social development.
It was also recognized that vital statistics should be taken up by an official

</p>

<p>
organization other than the Sanitary Commissioner or the Director General
of Health Services. In 1960, this responsibility was given to the Registrar
General, who was also the Census Commissioner of India. The Registrar
General of India is the central controlling authority in charge of the vital reg—
istration system. The Office of the Registrar General takes up the consolida-
tion and tabulation of the registered data at the national level. The Registrar
General is responsible for promoting the registration system in various states
and union territories. The Chief Registrar is in charge of the civil registra-
tion system in each state. Responsibility of actual registration is entrusted to
different departments such as police, revenue, health and so on.

</p>
<p>
   	Through the system of vital registrations, certain ancillary information is
also gathered, including the date of birth, sex of the baby, place of birth, age of
mother at the time of birth and so on. Information relating to death includes
the age of the person at the time of death, cause of death and place where death
occurred. On the basis of statistics of births and deaths in a particular area in a
calendar year, it is possible to measure the natural change in population.

</p>
 <p>
     Every birth certificate, death Certificate and marriage certificate requires
the above information, which reveals significant ancillary information.

</p>
<h1>
    Sample Registration System in India
</h1>

<p>
A large proportion of India’ s population resides in rural areas, where the
majority is illiterate. Investigators have to not only reach far- off places,
but also establish a liaison with the villagers for collecting information.
The Sample Registration System (SRS) was introduced in India in 1964.
The scheme was initiated to satisfy the necessity for reliable data on state
birth and death rates. It is a miniature registration system set in randomly
selected areas, wherein continuous recording of events is done through
local informants. This is supported by independent annual house- to- house
Surveys to detect omissions and lapses. Under SRS, a few towns and  villages
are selected, and the population events in these areas are continuously
recorded. Sample surveys are also carried out in these areas, which have
resulted in the maintenance of a dual record system.
</p>
<p>
    The SRS collects population data through two methods:

 i. Continuous enumeration— Under this system, all vital events are
recorded continuously.

 ii. Retrospective survey— Under this method, a supervisor conducts a
survey in an area every 6 months. It is believed that 6 months is a
short enough time for all population events to be remembered.

</p>
<p>
    The information obtained from both methods is compared. When there are
differences in the information collected, the Original source is contacted and
the necessary corrections are made.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00069">69</pagenum>

   <h1>
 page no : 69
</h1>
   <p>
    The SRS has faced several problems. They are as follows:
i. It is difficult to collect information from rural women, especially
   Muslim women as they observe purdah.

ii. Since people go out for work, it may not be possible to contact them
  even after a few visits. The investigators may be tempted to avoid such
houses, which may make the data inaccurate.

iii. Sometimes, correct information may not be given due to the fear of
 reprisal from government authorities.

iv. Information about stillbirths or infant deaths are not giVen easily,
 since it is felt that divulging such information may have a negative
 impact on the emotions and sentiments of the family.

v. Sometimes, the enumerators may themselves not understand the
  exact nature of the information they should collect, and may either go
beyond their scope or narrow it down. Sometimes, their biases and
behavior may put- off the respondents from giving proper information.

vi. Inadvertently, surveyors and supervisors may miss out some houses,
 or count some more than one, which can change the data profile
 significantly.

</p>

<p>
Some of these difficulties can be overcome by ensuring that surveyors and
supervisors belong to the areas from which information is being collected,
since they will be familiar with the people and the customs of the locality,
and can recollect certain happenings.

</p>
 <p>
    In conclusion, we can say that population data is of enormous impor-
tance for any country. Population statistics makes it possible to know the
W socio-economic conditions existing in a. society. They help in calculating
the mortality, fertility and migration rates, and reveal the trends in the
same. They help in providing social amenities and facilities to the society on
the basis of the needs and requirements of the people. They also bring to
the fore regional imbalances, and draw attention towards the economic
standards, poverty levels, unemployment levels, production patterns and
consumption needs, and so on. Economists try to analyze and solve eco-
nomic problems. In fact, one of the basis causes of all economic problems is
overpopulation. Insurance companies help in the formulation of social and
i economic policies, with emphasis on growth and development. Population
5 statistics tells us about the number of voters, and in locating the number of
seats on the basis of population into the Lok Sabha and State LegiSlature.
Population figures also help in knowing how far the existing population pro-
grammes are effective, and to make changes in them if necessary. There are
various ways of collecting population data, of which the census, registration
method, sample surveys and civil registrations are most important.

. Demographic data refers to data and information on various aspects
of a population.

. There are three important sources of population data— census, vital
registrations or civil registrations and sample surveys.

. A census is the total process of collecting, compiling and publishing
demographic, economic and social data pertaining, at a specified time
or times, to all persons of a defined territory. In most countries across
the world, population censuses are conducted at regular intervals.

. Censuses have been taken since the ancient times by emperors and
kings, who tried to assess the size and strength of their territories. The
early censuses were conducted intermittently, and the most impor-
tant reasons were to levy taxes or for military recruitment.

.Census involves several stages determining the contents, develop-
ing the census schedule, division of work, propaganda, household
survey, pretesting the questionnaire, and tabulation and publication
of data.

.There are two methods of collecting census data. In the de facto
method, information from the entire country is collected within a
day. In the de jure method, a period of two to three weeks is allotted
for the completion of census operations. Errors in census include
errors of enumeration; errors made by the respondents; inaccura-
cies in responses especially those dealing with occupation, number
of children and income; coverage errors; interviewer or enumerator
errors; errors of tabulation; errors in analysis, and misunderstanding
questions or failing to answer questions.

. The first comprehensive census was conducted in India in 1881. Since
then, every 10 years census operations are undertaken in the country.

.Sampling is a statistical procedure related to the selection of individ-
ual observatiOns that is used to gain some knowledge about a pop-
ulation of concern. Sampling can be random, systematic, stratified,
clustered and multistage.

. In the sample survey method, information is collected from a sam-
ple of the total population. The selected sample represents the whole
population, and generalizations for the entire population are made on
the basis of the conclusions from the study of the sample.

.Sample surveys are postal, telephonic, face- to- face and electronic.

.In India, a system of collecting data between each census period was
started, and the National Sample Survey came into use in 1950. Its

    After reading this chapter, you will be conversant with:
- Definition and Meaning of Fertility Fecundity
- Factors Affecting Fertility
. Age at Marriage and Fertility
- Fertility Rate in India
- Measures of Fertility


</p>
<p>
India is currently home to about 1.15 billion people, representing a full
17 per cent of the earth’s population. When India gained independence
from the United Kingdom 60 years ago, the country’ s population was a mere
350 million. Since 1947, the population of India has more than tripled. In
1950, India’ s total fertility rate was approximately 6 (children per woman).
Nonetheless, since 1952, India has worked to control its population growth.
In 1983, the goal of the country’ s National Health Policy was to have a
replacement value total fertility rate of 2.1 by the year 2000. That did not
occur. In 2000, the country established a new National Population Policy to
stem the growth of the country’ s population. One of the primary goals of the
policy was to reduce the total fertility rate to 2.1 by 2010. One of the steps
along the path toward the goal in 2010 was a total fertility rate of 2.6 by 2002.
As the total fertility rate in India remains at the high number of 2.8, that goal
was not achieved so it is highly unlikely that the total fertility rate will be 2.1
by 2010. Thus, India’ s population will continue to grow at a rapid rate. The
U.S. Census Bureau does predict a near- replacement total fertility rate of 2.2
to be achieved in India in the year 2050.

    INTRODUCTION , page no : 73
</h1>

<p>
    The study of human fertility lS central to population and demographic stud-
ies. One of the basic population processes is fertility. It is a phenomenon
which influences birth rates, and consequently the population of a country.
It is necessary to study the birth rates and the factors that influence it. Births
affect and influence the family structure as well as the society. Human fertility
is responsible for biological replacement and maintenance of human society.
The growth of population depends entirely on human fertility. It is through
human fertility that a society replenishes itself. It is a positive force that helps
expand a population. Fertility is, thus, a process that is necessary for the per-
petuation (continuation) of humankind. If the fertility rates are low, and the
replacement of human numbers is inadequate, or if the number of deaths in a
society are more than the number of births, the population will decline, and
the society may face the possibility of extinction. If fertility rates are high,
the birth rates will be high and there will be excessive replacement of human
numbers. This leads to overpopulation and many related problems.

    DEFINITION AND MEANING OF FERTILITY AND FECUNDITY

    Fertility is the ability of a woman to conceive and carry a child to delivery. It
is a broad term used to cover all aspects of the reproductive performance of
a population of a country. It 15 the average number of children each woman
will bear in her fertile years (normally, taken to be between 15 and 50). Lewis
and Thompson define fertility as a term generally used to indicate the actual
reproductive performance of a woman or groups of women. The crude birth
(number of children born per 1000 population per year) is only one mea-
sure of fertility /According to Bernard Benjamin, ‘fertility measures the rate
at which a population adds to itself by births, and is normally assessed by
relating the number of births to the size of some section of population, such
as the number of married couples to the number of women of child bearing
age, i. e., an appropriate yardstick of potential fertility Barclay defined fertil-
ity as the fundamental notion of fertility is an actual level of performance in
a population, based on the number of live births that occur. Fertility can be
ascertained from statistics of births.) The study of fertility does not indicate
the level of fecundity for which there is no direct measurement’. It refers to
an organism’s ability to reproduce. Individuals that can reproduce are fertile.
Individuals that cannot reproduce are infertile. They become infertile (unable
to reproduce) when they cannot generate gametes (eggs or sperm) or when
their gametes cannot yield a viable embryo after fertilization. Common causes
of infertility are low sperm count in males; blocked oviducts; infrequent ovu-
lation (release of gamete) in females; consequence of infections in the female

reproductive tract; and genetic make-up. Human fertility depends on several
factors, including nutrition, sexual behavior, culture, instinct, endocrinol-
ogy, timing, economics, way of life and emotions.
</p>
 <p>
    Fecundity refers to the capacity of women to conceive or bear children.
Thompson and Lewis state that, ‘Fecundity is a biological potential and the
physiological capacity to participate in reproduction/5 The absence of this
potential is known as infecundity or sterility however childlesSness is
not a proof of infecundity of the wife; that may be due to the sterility of either
the wife or the husband and may arise from the fact that the spermatozoa of
a particular male cannot fertilize the ova of a particular female, i. e., to the
mutual incompatibility of the individual’s germs cells’. Fecundity is the state
of being fertile or the capability to produce offspring. It is the physiological
reproductive capacity of an organism or population, i. e., ,its potential ability
to produce viable offspring. Incapability of women to conceive or produce
offspring will result in infecundity Infecundity can also result from male
or female sterility. The term sterility refers to lack of sperm production or
inability to ovulate. Approximately, 40 per cent of reported cases of infertility
are due to problems in the males; another 40 per cent are due to problems
in the females; the remaining 20 per cent are of unknown cause or due to
problems in both the males and females. Infertility can be caused by any
interruption in the usual process of fertilization, pregnancy and birth. In
women, the most common problems are failure to ovulate and blockage of
the fallopian tubes. In men, low sperm count is the most common problem.

</p>
<p>
      It is difficult to study or estimate the levels of fecundity or infecundity in
a population. It is not clear to which period of human life it should be linked
to— the entire lifetime or the reproduCtive age. Another problem is the type
of population it should be linked to the entire population or the total
married population. The fertility rate is directly linked to women, whereas
fecundity is linked to both men and women.

</p>
 <p>
      Most of the information regarding fertility is obtained from three impor-
tant sources:

 i. Civil registration system: This. is a source which gives information
about the number of registrations of birth in each calendar year. The
Demographic Year Book of the UNO, which is an annual publication,
contains information on the registered live births of various coun-
tries. It also contains information about the age of the mother, sex of
the baby, crude birth rate of rural and urban areas, etc.

 ii. National period census: In national census, information is sought
about the children born and the information provided becomes the
basis for collecting further information about fertility.

 iii. Sample fertility survey: It is a very important source of informa-
tion about fertility. Sample Fertility Survey provides information on

</p>

<p>
fertility of any group. In this survey, it is possible to have informa-
tion for an analysis of fertility from different angles, i. e., age at mar-
riage, reproductive history, attitude and practice of family planning
methods, etc. Thus, registration system provides information about
the number of children ever born and also during the last 12 months.
\ Sample Fertility Survey gives information about number of children
ever born during the last 12 months.

</p>
<p>
    In this regard, it may be mentioned that fecundity of a woman will always
be affected by her biological potentiality and tendency of lactation. It is also
observed that most of the ladies who breast-feed their children after con-
finement have lesser fertility, as they do not conceive in the lactation period.
Fecundity is also affected by living standards, environment and health ame-
nities available In a society. Some demographers have tried to establish that
fecundity is also influenced by heredity

</p>
<h1>
     FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY
</h1>
<p>

 The process of fertility is affected by various factors. They include biological,
 social and economic factors.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00076">76</pagenum>

 <h1>
     page no : 76
</h1>

<p>
    The basic determinants of fertility are discussed in the following:
</p>

<h1>
    Biological Determinants
</h1>

<p>
    The biological determinants are as follows:

i. Race: Fertility differences are generated based on racial characteris-
   tics. Different racial groups exhibit varying birth rates, e. g., the whites,
  blacks and yellows in Brazil have different birth rates.

ii. Fecundity: It refers to the capacity to reproduce children. The genetic
  fertility of women is an important biological factor.

iii. Sterility: Both men and women are responsible for lower fertil-
 ity. The lower the proportion of sterility, the higher is the rate of
fertility.

iv. Physical and mental health: The general physical and mental health
conditions are the basic needs of human fertility. Bad health condi-
tions result in low fertility, due to high sterility and high incidence of
mortality.
</p>
<h1>
    Demographic Determinants
</h1>

<p>
    The following are the demographic determinants:
i. Age structure of population— It is one of the basic determinants of
human fertility. The proportion of population in the reproductive age
group will have a direct bearing upon birth rate. The cOuntries having
a large share of youth in the population are the leading contributors
to the world’s population growth, e. g., countries of Asia, Africa and
Latin America.

ii. Age at marriage: The more the number of people of the marriageable
  age, the greater will be the fertility rate.

iii. Sex composition: The role of the sex composition factor becomes
 obvious when the birth rate of populations having unbalanced ratios
is examined. In India for example, the urban centres largely attract
male immigrants and so there is a paucity of females, leading to low
birth rates.

iv. Death rate: When the death rate is high, the birth rate has to be
maintained at high levels in order to continue the race. But, improved
medical facilities and educatiOn may lead to low death rates and
births rates as well.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00077">77</pagenum>

<h1>
    Socio-cultural Determinants
</h1>
<p>
    The following are the socio-cultural determinants:

 i. Marriage status: The age of women at marriage and the spacing of
births affect fertility rates. Late marriages lead to lower fertility and
early marriages to higher fertility. Thus, marriage status is closely
related to social, economic and cultural conditions.

 ii. Religion and social attitudes: Traditional societies prefer large fami-
lies. Marriage in such societies is a religious duty. The use of con-
traception and abortion do not have religious approval. Children
are often regarded as the gift of God. However, in a society where
religious dogmas do not prevail, the birth rate is generally lower. In
male -dominated societies, the desire for a son raises the fertility rates.

 iii. Illiteracy and ignorance: Ignorant and illiterate people do not
  know or realize the need for birth control. They also do not have the
knowledge of biology of reproduction. Thus, education is needed to
effectively reduce the fertility rates. Education also raises the age of
marriage, it broadens the mindset of the population and it also cre-
ates interest in new facilities of recreation and enjoyment. Societies
with a large proportion of educated population generally have lower
fertility.

 iv. Family organization: The joint family system shares the responsi-
 bility of bringing up and providing for children, therefore fertility is
not restricted. In nuclear families, the parents alone have to take the
responsibility of children; therefore, they are careful in determining
the size of the family, leading to controlled and minimized fertility.

 v. Customs and traditions: In societies where customs like widow
	remarriages are prevalent, the rate of fertility would be higher.

 vi. Government policies: The implementation of family planning, poli-
cies lowers the fertility rate in most of the underdeveloped countries
which face the problems of overpopulation.

</p>
<h1>
    Economic Determinants
</h1>

<p>
    The following are the economic determinants:

 i. Economic status: There is a negative correlation between the income
level and the family size. Poverty associated with factors such as illit-
eracy, ill health, poor diet, etc. keep the birth rate high. Low protein
content in the diet leads to weak liver in men, which cannot neu-
tralize the oestrogen of women, leading to higher reproductivity in
women. Also, poor families often cannot afford alternate recreation

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00078">78</pagenum>
   <h1>
     page no : 78
</h1>
<p>
and enjoyment. As the death rates are high in poor families, they
generally give birth to a large number of children so that. at least a
few of them survive. Economic status is, thus, found to be inversely
proportional to the fertility rates.

 ii. Standard of living: In order to maintain a high standard of living,
parents prefer small families, but poor families have more children to
increase the number of earning members in the family. High standard
of living is associated with low fertility and vice versa. According to
the studies of Prof. F. W. Natstein, the greater the value of houses, the
greater the number of children.

 iii. Urban- rural areas: People in rural areas prefer early marriages and
follow many superstitions against birth control and abortion. Rural
areas, therefore, record higher fertility rates. In urban centres, people
are generally literate and more aware. They do not encourage unsci-
entific thinking and superstitions hence the fertility rate in urban
areas is low.

 iv. Occupation: According to a survey in America, coal miners had the
largest number of children, followed by farmers, bankers, lawyers,
judges and physicians. Bookkeepers had the least number of children.
The fertility among working women is also lower than non— working
women. Thus, occupation structure also has an effect on the fertility
of a population.
</p>

<h1>
    Climatic Determinants
</h1>

<p>
    Climate is an important determinant of fertility. Countries having hot cli-
mate have higher fertility. In tropical areas, women enter into reproductive
age group early and so the period of reproduction is lengthened. Thus, hot
countries generally have high fertility rates.

</p>
<p>
    The study of human fertility forms an important part of the study of
human populations. Fertility is a process that is responsible for growth and
replacement of a population. Changes in fertility lead to changes in the
structure and size of populations.

</p>
<p>
    Fertility trends reveal that till the early part of the twentieth century,
fertility was high in many countries across the world. However, fertility tran—
sitions resulted in a decrease in infertility rates first in the more industrial—
ized and developed regions of the world, and gradually in the less developed
regions. Differential fertility is based on the levels of economic development,
education and female employment, urbanization, age at marriage, status of
women, influence of religion and so on.

</p>
<p>
     There is a direct relationship between fertility and age at marriage— the
lower the age at marriage, the longer is the fertility span, and the higher is the

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00079">79</pagenum>

<p>
fertility. Conversely, the higher the age at marriage, the shorter is the fertility
span and the lower is the fertility.

</p>
<p>
   	The declining fertility trends have resulted 1n slowing down the growth
rate of the world population. It is estimated that though the fertility rates in
the developing and underdeveloped countries continue to be relatively high,
the world’s population will stabilize in the next 300 years.

</p>
<h1>
    AGE AT MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY
</h1>

<p>
    Marriage is a social institution, which has direct impact upon the size of the
population. Religious and social customs, as well as the laws of the country,
govern the institution of marriage. Marriage gives social, religious and legal
sanction for sexual relations and parenthood. Age at marriage is an impor—
tant determinant of total fertility. In general, children born out of wedlock
are considered illegitimate. There is a direct relationship between age at mar-
riage and fertility— the lower the age at marriage, the longer is the fertility
11;: period or the fertility span, and the higher is the fertility. Conversely, the
higher the age at marriage, the shorter is the fertility span and the fertility
rate decreases.

</p>
<p>
    Marriage patterns have implications for the status of women their health
and fertility. Though out— of —wedlock births are common in many countries,
it is the entry into marriage that usually marks the beginning of exposure
to childbearing. There are differences in the mean age at marriage between
males and females, and between regions. In almost all countries of the world,
men generally marry later than women. In developed regions, the average
mean age at marriage for males is 27.9 years and for females, it is 25.2 years.
In comparison, the mean age at marriage for males in the less developed
regions is 24.9 years and for females, it is 21.4 years. Compared to men, a larger
proportion of women ever married in age group of 15—19 years.
</p>

<p>
    The difference in age at marriage for males and females varies within
and between regions. In Europe and Northern America, the mean age at
marriage is at least 29 years for both males and females (Finland, Germany,
Greenland, Iceland and Sweden); 24 years or less in the Republic of Moldova,
San Marino and Ukraine; and 21 years fOr females in Bulgaria, Gibraltar,
Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.

</p>
<p>
      In Asia, the mean age at marriage for men ranges from 22 years in Nepal
and 23 years in Tajikistan to about 30 years in Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait,
the Republic of Korea and Singapore. The mean age at marriage for women
ranges from about 18 years in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to at least 27
years in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

</p>
 <p>
     The difference in the male and female mean age at marriage is at least
four years in 21 of the 64 countries, and in only three countries (Afghanistan,

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00080">80</pagenum>

<p>
Bangladesh and Lebanon) does the age difference exceed five years. The pro—
portion of men aged 15—19 who have ever married is below 10 per cent in
almost all Asian countries except Nepal (14 per cent) and Iraq (15 per cent).
In Asia, 46 out of 65 countries show that at least 10 per cent of the women
aged 15—19 have ever married. Japan and the Republic of Korea have the
lowest proportion of ever -married women (less than 1 per cent) in age group
15—19, while in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, it is more than 50 per cent.

</p>
  <p>
    In all African countries except the Republic of Congo and Uganda, the
proportion of men aged 15—19 years who have ever married is below 10
per cent. On the other hand, at least 30 per cent of women aged 15—19 have
ever married in half of the African countries. In the Republic of Congo, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and the Niger, at least 55 per cent of women
aged 15—19 have ever been married, while Libya, South Africa and Tunisia
have the lowest proportion of ever- married women (less than 5 per cent) in
age group 15—19 in Africa.

</p>
 <p>
     In Africa, the mean age at marriage varies from 22 years (in Uganda) to
32 years (in Libya) for men, and from 17 years (in the Democratic Republic
of Congo) to 29 years (in Libya) for women. The highest age gaps in the mean
age at first marriage are the highest in Africa. The difference in the mean
age at marriage is at least five years in more than half of the countries and,
in only five countries (Cape Verde, Libya, Reunion, Seychelles and South
Africa) is the difference in mean age at marriage is less than three years.

</p>
  <p>
    In Latin America and the Caribbean, the mean age at marriage is at
least 30 years and 27 years for men and women, respectively, in at least half
the countries. The differences in the mean age at marriage are smaller in
Latin America and the Caribbean than in Africa or Asia; only in three coun-
tries (Haiti, Montserrat and Paraguay) is the age difference above four years.
In addition, while in all countries, the proportion of ever- married men in
age group 15—19 years is less than 8 per cent; the prOportion of ever— married
women in the same group is above 8 per cent in 33 of the 51 countries shown.
In Cuba, Honduras and Nicaragua, at least 29 per cent of women aged 15—19
have ever married. HoweVer, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the data
may not reflect appropriately the patterns of first marriage, given the large
proportions of consensual unions, which are common in many countries of
the region.

</p>
  <p>
     For Oceania, in only Kiribati and Marshall Islands, is. the mean age at
marriage below 25 years for men. For women, in none of the countries or
areas is the mean age at marriage less than 20 years. In most countries, the
age gap in the mean age at marriage is less than three years. Like in the
other major regions, in Oceania, fewer men than women aged 15—19 have
ever married; the proportion of ever- married men in age group 15—19 is less
than 8 per cent in all countries. However, in only 6 of the 27 countries (Fiji,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands) is the

<p>
proportion of ever -married women in age group 15—19 above 8 per cent.
Moreover, even in these six countries, fewer than 21 per cent of the women
aged 15—19 have ever married.

</p>
<p>
   	On the whole, the disparity in marriage timing for males and females
is broader in Africa than elsewhere. Of the 20 countries with the loW-
est mean age at marriage for females, 15 are in Africa while the rest are in
Asia. Similarly, of the 20 countries with the highest age gaps in the mean
age at first marriage, 16 countries are in Africa, compared to two in Asia
(Afghanistan and Bangladesh), one in Latin America and the Caribbean
(Montserrat), one in Oceania (Nauru), and none in Europe and Northern
America. Even within Africa, regional differences are apparent; a. large pro—
portion of countries with the largest age gaps at first marriage is in Western
Africa. The Democratic Republic of Congo has the highest percentage of
ever- married women in the adolescent age group (74. 2 per cent), while Iraq
has the highest proportion of ever- married men of the same age group, that
is, 14.9 per cent.

</p>
 <p>
      Fertility decline is preceded by a decline in number of marriages, and
the ‘retreat from marriage’ phenomenon that is being observed in most
developed and certain developing countries. In developed countries, early
sexual experiences outside marriages and shorter duration of marriages have
resulted 1n a decline 1n the stability of marriages.

</p>
<p>
   	Overall, the average age for first marriages is becoming older, at 22— 26
years for women and 25— 28 for men. Under 2 per cent of men aged 20— 24
are married in most regions except in South -central Asia and Oceania, while
40—70 per cent of women aged 20—24 are married in Sub- Saharan Africa,
Southeastern and central Asia, Western Asia and» Oceania. Over 90 per cent
of youth under the age of 20 are unmarried. However, in Sub -Saharan Africa
and South— central Asia, more than 20 per cent of women below 20 years are
married.

Mean Age at Marriage in India

In America, the average age at marriage varies according to social status,
family traditions and even geographical situation. Generally speaking, peo—
ple in big cities tend to marry late and wait longer to have children, normally
well into their 303. People growing up in rural communities will probably
get married for the ﬁrst time in their early twenties. In developed countries,
the average age at marriage has also been pushed back because many couples
now choose to live together for years before. even considering marriage. In
the 19505, when sharing a home before marriage wasn’t the standard, people
got married younger.

    married as soon as they turn 15 . This is the case also in many African coun—
tries, where economic factors force parents to marry off their daughters at an
early age. Nigeria has some of the lowest averages in Africa, with most men
getting married around 23 and most women at 17.

</p>
<p>
      The average age at marriage peaks higher 1n Scandinavian countries such
as Denmark, Where it is 30.2 for women and 32.5 for men. Sweden, Finland,
and Norway are closely behind. In continental Europe, the average age at
marriage is lower in the Eastern countries, where the numbers are barely 23
years of age for women in Poland and 26 for men in Romania.

</p>
 <p>
      China and Japan have joined European Countries in their high averages,
which are around 30 years old for both men and women. This is especially
true of the major metropolitan zones, but rural areas are quickly catching up
to the trend. It is important to note that, in many countries, the average age
at marriage is closely related to the number of divorces that occur every year.
Young couples have almost three times the chance of ending up divorced
than people getting married after 27 years old.

</p>

<p>
In India, the mean age at marriage for both boys and girls is low. The mini—
mum legal age at marriage has been revised several times over the decades.
It was made 18 years for boys and 13 years ~for girls in 1929, 18 years for boys
and 15 years for girls in 1955, 19 years for boys and 15 for girls in 1958, and
the final revision was made in 1978, when it was made 21 years for boys and
18 years for girls.

<p>
The data in Table 3.2 reveals that in India, the age of marriage continues to
remain low, especially in the northern states. Between 1951 and 1995, the
mean age at marriage increased for women from 15.6 to 19.4 years.

</p>
  <p>
     The World Fertility Report 2003, prepared by the Population Division
of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations
Secretariat, presents a compilation of key estimates and indicators of fertility,
nuptiality and contraceptive use for 192 countries, referring mostly to the
19705 and to the 19905 but covering earlier when necessary or more recent
periods when possible. The set of data presented permit an assessment of
the unprecedented changes in nuptiality, contraceptive use and fertility that
have occurred since the 19705s. In particular, the report documents the fol-
lowing key findings:

 i. A major worldwide shift in the timing of marriage to older ages has
occurred. The median value of the singulate mean age at marriage for
the world r05e from 25.4 to 27.2 years among men and from 21.5 to
23.2 years among women. For developed countries, the increase has
been even more striking, with the median rising from 25.2 to 28.8
years for men and from 22.0 to 26.1 for women.

 ii. Both men and women are spending longer periods of their life
being single. The median of the percentage ever- married among per-
sons aged 25—29 declined from 85 per cent in the 1970s, to 76 per cent
in the 19905 for women, and from 68 per cent to 56 per cent for men.
Again, the reductions in the percentage of ever— married persons aged
25—29 are more substantial for developed countries, whose median
values declined from 85 per cent to 62 per cent among women and
from 74 per cent to 43 per cent among men.

 iii. Delayed marriage among young adults has not yet resulted in
noticeable reductions in the percentage of persons marrying at
least once during their lifetime. Marriage or some form of consen-
sual union continues to be nearly universal. In the 1970s, in three out
of every four countries, 89 per cent or more of all men and all women
aged 45—49 had been married at least once and that figure was still
close to 89 per cent by the 1990s.

 iv. Divorce rates have increased in most cOuntries as evidenced from -
data available. In developed countries, the median rate of divorce
rose from 13 divorces per 100 for men and women in the 1970s
to 24 divorces per 100 men and 27 per 100 women in the 1990s.
In developing countries, the median rate of divorce increased from
7 to 12 divorces per 100 men and from 5 to 15 divorces per 100
women. That is, not only has there been a tendency for people to
marry late, but also the instability of marital unions has been rising.

<p>
Both trends clearly have significant implications for reproductive
behaviour.
 </p>

<p>
V. A tremendous increase in the use of family planning methods.
Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the use of contraception among
women currently married or in union increased in nine out of every
ten countries as supported by information available. The median level
of contraceptive use at the world level increased from 38 per cent of
women currently married or in union in the 1970s to 52 per cent in
the 1990s. For developing countries, the median prevalence rose from
27 per cent to 40 per cent between those dates. By the 1990s, contra-
ceptive prevalence in a quarter of all developing countries was 62 per
cent or higher.
 </p>

<p>
vi. The use of modern contraceptive methods in developing countries
has generally risen. The median use of modern contraception in
developing countries increased from 18 to 30 per cent between the
1970s and the 1990s. However, in a quarter of all developing coun—
tries, the use of modern contraceptive methods remains rare, with
levels of use remaining below 12 per cent.
 </p>

<p>
vii. Between 1970 and 2000, the world population experienced a major
and unprecedented reduction of fertility levels, driven mostly by
the decline in fertility in developing countries. Average fertility
levels in the developing world dropped from over 5.9 children per
woman in the 1970s to about 3.9 children per woman in the 1990s.
The median fertility reduction in developing countries between the
1970s and the 1990s was of the order of 1.8 children per woman and
a quarter of all developing countries appear to have achieved reduc-
tions of 2.6 children per woman or more.
 </p>


<p>
viii. While fertility was uniformly high in developing countries in the
1970s, the fertility levels of developing countries today vary over
a wide range. Thus, fertility remains above 5 children per woman
in a number of least developed countries but it has reached below-
replacement levels in about 20 developing countries.
 </p>

<p>
ix. Fertility levels in developed countries, many of which experi-
enced a ‘baby boom’ during the 1950s and the 1960s, have gener-
ally declined since 1970. The median reduction in the total fertility
of developed countries was 0.8 children per woman between the
1970s and the 1990s. By the late 1990s, only four developed coun-
 tries, Albania, Iceland, New Zealand and the United States of
America, reported a total fertility of 2 children per woman or higher.
Furthermore, in 14 developed countries, fertility was lower than 1.3
children per woman, an unprecedented low level of fertility in the
recorded history of large populations.
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00085">85</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
X. Levels of childlessness vary considerably among major areas. In
the 1990s, the proportion of childless women among those aged
45—49 tended to be high in developed countries and in countries of
the Caribbean. At least 7 per cent of women aged 45—49 were child-
less in four of every five developed countries with data, and in nine
developed countries, the proportion of childless women surpassed 10
per cent. Levels of childlessness were relatively low in Africa and Asia
in the 1990s and moderate in Latin America. Between the 1970s and
the 1990s, levels of childlessness declined in Africa, as sterility caused
by sexually transmitted diseases decreased during the 1970s and the
1980s.
</p>

<p>
xi. The profound changes in fertility levels occurring since 1970
have been made possible by major behavioural transformations
related to union formation, marriage and the use of contracep-
tion. Government policies on access to contraceptives have played
an important role in modifying reproductive behaviour. In 1976, 52
per cent of all governments reported that they had no intervention
to modify fertility levels, but by 2001 that percentage had dropped
to 32 per cent (Fig. 3.2). Government support for family planning
increased steadily since the 1970s. By 2001, 92 per cent of all gov-
ernments supported family planning programmes and distributed
contraceptives either directly (75 per cent), through government
facilities, or indirectly (17 per cent), by supporting the activi-
ties of non-governmental organizations such as family planning
associations.
</p>

<p>
The data on fertility, nuptiality, contraceptive use and policies relating to
childbearing presented in this report were selected to reflect the major trans-
formations of reproductive and nuptiality behaviour that have taken place
since 1970, that is, over the course of a generation.
</p>

<p>
FERTILITY RATE IN INDIA

India’s fertility rate  is at 3.2 and is ranked 87th in the world in terms of
fertility. There has been a marginal decrease in the country’s total fertility,
from 3.6 in 1991 to 3.2 in 2000. The reasons for the continuing high fertility
in the country include poverty, rural residence, agricultural economy, low
age at marriage especially for women, low female education and employ-
ment, and low status of women.

This doorway gives a figure for the average number of children that would be
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and
bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility
rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth
rate, since it refers to births per woman. This pointer shows the budding for
population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman is con—
sidered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in relative stability in
terms of total numbers. Rates above two children indicate populations groW—
ing in size and whose median age is declining. Higher rates may also indicate
difficulties for families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children
and for women to enter the labour force. Rates below two children indicate
populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in
general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized countries,
especially Western Europe, where populations are projected to decline dra-
matically over the next 50 years.

<p>
MEASURES OF FERTILITY

There are various methods of measuring fertility. The most commonly used
methods are as follows:
 </p>

<p>
Crude Birth Rate (CBR)

Crude birth rate is a common measure of human fertility. It is obtained by
dividing the number of births recorded in a population during a specified
year by its total numbers. This rate is called crude because the differences
in the Composition, such as age and sex, are ignored in calculating it. It is
expressed in terms of the number of births in a year per thousand of the
mid—year population. It is calculated as follows:

Crude Birth Rate = Total number of children born in a year X 1000/Mid—year population

CBR = (B1/P) x 1000

where,

B1= Live births during a year; and
P = Estimated mid-year population.

This method of calculating birth rates does not specify why birth rates are
different in different years and between different populations at the same
date. Moreover, it is not exactly accurate to find out fertility rate on the basis
of the entire population, basically because the entire population in a country

 </p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00088">88</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:88
</h1>
<p>
cannot be fertile. There cannot be fertility among children and the aged.
Therefore, another method of calculating fertility is the refined fertility rate
or the general fertility rate.
</p>

<p>
General Fertility Rate (GFR)

General fertility rate is the number of births per 1000 women of reproduc—
tive ages. The number of women of childbearing age is taken as a base for
calculating the birth rate, instead of the total population.
</p>
<p>
This method IS an improvement over CBR, as it takes into account only
the population in the reproductive age group, i..,e only the females in the
age group 15— 49, since it is only these females who can bear children. Bogue
(1969) has defined general fertility rate as the ‘number of births in a year
per 1000 women of child bearing age’. Barclay states, ‘General Fertility Rate
or General Fertility Ratio is the ratio of total yearly registered births to
the population of women of childbearing age. The purpose is to restrict the
denominator of the rate to potential mothers by excluding all men and large
groups of women not exposed to the risk of child bearing by reason of age’. It
is calculated by taking into account only the females in the reproductive age
group. It is expressed in terms of the number of children below five years of
age per 1000 females of reproductive age. It is calculated as:

General Fertility Rate =
Total number of live births in a year X 1000
Mid-year population of women in reproductive age group
This can also be calculated by using the following formula:

GFR = B/ P15-49 X 1000

Another method of calculating the fertility ratio is as follows:

FR =   [P0— 4]/[Pf15-49] x 1000

where,
P0 -4 = Number of children under five years; and
Pf15 - 49 2 Females of childbearing age.

According to Thompson and Lewis, the GFR is usually four or five times
higher than the CBR, since the women in the reproductive age group nor-
mally constitute one- fourth to one- fifth of the total population.
</p>


<p>
Age- specific Birth Rate (ABR) or Age- specific Fertility Rate (ASFR)

This is an important refinement in the measurement of fertility. It measures
the number of births in a year to women of a given age group per thousand
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00089">89</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:89
</h1>
<p>
women in that age group. It is obtained by dividing the number of births
of women in each age group by the number of women in that age group.
Women in the reproductive age group are divided into different sub-age
groups, and the fertility rate for each subgroup is calculated separately. This
calculation brings out the differences in fertility rates, in different age groups,
and it also indicates which age group(s) has the maximum fertility, Which
is helpful in targeting groups for the implementation of family planning .-
programmes. It IS calculated as follows:

Age Specific Fertility Rate =

Number of births to women in a specific age grOUP
__________________________________________________  x1000
 Mid—year population of women in that age group



ASFR = Ba /Pa x1000
where,
Ba = Number Of births to women in a specific age group; and
Pa = Mid-year population of women in that specific age group.

The ABR for the age group 20—24 is calculated as follows:

 ABR f20_24 =[B20-24]/ [Pf20—24] x 1000

f 20—24
where,
B20-24— =Number of births to women Of a given age group (for example,
20— 24); and
Pf20_ 24— Female population in that age group.

This rate has been given preference for the following reasons:

i. It is accepted that all women in all the groups do not have the same
reproductive capacity and that changes with age.

ii. It is possible to study actual cohorts (a group of people having approx-
imately the same age) of women, and to examine whether the repro-
ductive capacity of women decreased or increased with the increase
in age.

iii. ASFR helps in calculating total fertility rate and cumulative fertility
rate.

iv. It helps in formulating policies regarding family planning.

v. It reveals distribution of frequencies of births among women accord-
ing to age.
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00090">90</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:90
</h1>
<p>
vi. It helps in the analysis of fertility performance in a year.

vii. The rate identifies certain stages in the reproductive careers of differ-
ent age groups of women.
</p>
<p>
Total Fertility Rate (TFR)

The total fertility rate refers to the average number of children that each
woman will have during her lifetime. It is an average of the ASFR because,
of Course, some women will have more, some fewer and some no children at
all. It is an average of the ASFR, and is calculated by summing up the birth
rates of each age group for women in the reproductive age. It is an estimate of
the number of children a cohort of 1000 women would bear if they all went
through their reproductive years exposed to the age- specific fertility rates in
effect at a particular time.
</p>
<p>
Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR)

Total fertility includes all births, both boys and girls. GRR shows how many
baby girls, or potential future mothers, would be born to 1000 women pass-
ing through their childbearing years, assuming that age- specific birth rates
in a given year remained constant and if no women entering the childbear -
ing period died before reaching menopause. This rate is calculated by mul-
tiplying total fertility by the percentage of all births that are female births. If
the result is 1000 or more, it shows that 1000 or more daughters are being
given birth by each 1000 women of childbearing age, without taking into
account deaths of women during their reproductive period. GRR is a sum—
mary measure describing the reproductive behaviour in one year without

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00091">91</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
regard for mortality. It overlooks not only mortality, but also changing fertil-
ity.
  </p>
<p>
Net Reproduction Rate (NRR)

GRR does not take into account the mortality of infant girls before they
themselves reach the reproductive age or the age of their mothers they are
supposed to replace. It also does not consider the mortality of the parents
before they reach the end of the childbearing period. NRR is a rate that is
calculated by taking into account the deaths occurring during each five- year
period as women pass through the childbearing period. It involves the use
of life tables and calculation of how many girl babies born actually live up to
the reproductive age.
  </p>

<p>
 Child —Woman Ratio

The child— woman ratio is the ratio of young children to women of age groups
including mothers. A common ratio is that of children under five years of
age and women from 15—50 years.
  </p>
<p>
Net Replacement Ratio

This is one of the most useful measures. It relates to the number of female
births to the number of potential mothers in the existing population, i.e., the
number of women between 15 and 50 years of age. If the net replacement
ratio is less than one, the number of potential mothers in the next generation
will be reduced.

SUMMARY

. Fertility is an important demographic process that influences
birth rates and population growth. It is the ability of a woman
to conceive and carry a child to delivery. Fecundity is a bio—
logical potential and the physiological capacity to participate in
reproduction.

. Reasons for fertility decline include behavioural changes, mortality
decline and improved survival, changing demand for children, diffu-
sion of new ideas, governmental efforts in reducing fertility, change in
marriage patterns, gender roles, and so on.

. Age at marriage has a direct relationship with fertility. The lower the
age at marriage, the longer will be the reproductive span, and the
higher will be fertility. Conversely, high age at marriage shortens the
fertility span and decreases fertility.

. The mean age at marriage in India has been steadily declining over
the years, both for males and females. There are considerable inter-
state variations in the age at marriage, with Kerala having the high-
est mean age at marriage, and the states of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh having the lowest.

INTRODUCTION

Mortality is a biological and demographic process that has a tremendous
impact on population. It affects and influences the growth rate of popula-
tion, as well as fertility rates. It is one of the three main components of popu-
lation change, the other two being fertility and migration. The increase in
population in many countries, especially Europe, following the Industrial
Revolution was mainly due to a decline in death rates. Many developing
countries are going through a period of demographic transition wherein
the death rates are rapidly declining. In fact, it has been opined that the
sharp declines in mortality rates, rather than an increase in fertility rates,
are responsible for the rapid growth of population in many countries across
the world.
 </p>
<p>
The study of mortality is useful for analysing current demographic con-
ditions and for determining changing mortality conditions. Administrators
use mortality statistics to formulate, implement and evaluate public health
programmes. The study of mortality also deals with the process of death
and its effect on the population. As a demographic process, mortality also
affects fertility patterns—— it has been seen that higher mortality rates usu-
ally lead to higher fertility rates. Social demographers also study the causes
and consequences of a particular mortality rate on the population and the
society.

<p>
DEFINITION AND MEANING OF MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY

In simple terms, mortality refers to death, or the end of life. The United
Nations and the World Health Organization have defined death as: ‘the per-
manent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after birth (post-natal
cessation of all vital function without capacity of resuscitation)’ (Bhende and
Kanitkar 1991). A live birth has been defined by the United Nations as, ‘the
complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of concep—
tion, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation,
breaths or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart,
pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles,
whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached:
each product of such a birth is considered live— bOrn’ (Raj 2003). On the basis
of this definition, Hauser and Duncan concluded that, ‘...death is indicated
by the fact that after such separation the foetus does not breathe or show any
other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbili—
cal cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles’ (Raj 2003). It is evident
from the above definitions that any death prior to a live birth is not consid-
ered death. Abortions and stillbirths are categorized as foetal deaths, and not
as deaths
</p>

<p>

 Mortality data is collected for various reasons that affect the economic,
political and social life of people. Some of the important reasons are as
follows:

i. Mortality data reveal the health conditions existing in a society. They
help in finding out the extent to which a society is healthy, and the
direction of movement of society, i.e., to what extent social evils, eco-
nomic strains, negligence, provision of adequate health facilities and
so on are responsible for the occurrence of death, or how far they
have been successful in keeping down the mortality rates.

ii. Mortality data reveal the extent to which a society is geared to meet
its health problems through the public health system and medical
facilities.

iii. Mortality data is used in calculating the growth rate of population
(birth rates minus the death rates).

iv. Mortality statistics are used by administrators to plan for adequate
health facilities.

v. Mortality rates are used to study the causes of death, and adequate
arrangements are then made to ensure that these causes are properly
dealt with.

vi. High mortality rate indicates poor socio-economic conditions in
a society. There is poverty, high level of illiteracy, traditional social
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00096">96</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:96
</h1>
<p>
	customs and social evils, low status of women generally leading to
high maternal and female mortality, high unemployment levels and
general apathy towards life.

vii. Mortality data is also useful in planning for adequate and improved
health facilities.
 </p>

<p>
Morbidity refers to a state in which a person is alive, but is not able to do
anything productive, or any physical, economic or social work. If health is
defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, mor—
bidity is a situation in which either one or more, or all these conditions are
missing. Morbid individuals are those who are either physically or mentally
unfit, or are afflicted by physical or mental problems, which do not allow
them to function properly. Morbidity can take the form of physical defor-
mity, mental deficiency, depression and many other forms. A person in a
state of coma or one afflicted by an incurable or fatal disease is stated to be
morbid.
 </p>

<p>
Morbidity has far- reaching effects not only for the morbid individuals,
but also for the society. The morbid individuals cannot contribute anything
to themselves or to the family or to the nation. The state of morbidity creates
a sense of depression within morbid individuals as well as among the people
surrounding them. Such individuals feel they are a burden to themselves,
their families and the society on the whole.
 </p>

<p>
It is not easy to get adequate data on morbidity. One method is by con-
tacting and talking to morbid individuals themselves, their doctors, persons
attending to them, or family members, who can give information on their
behalf. This is usually not an easy method, since people may find it difficult
to talk of their problems or those of family members or friends. Another
method is the institutional records, such as those maintained by hospitals or
other health institutions. Surveys, either small or large, can also help collect
information on morbidity. For this, an area is selected and efforts are made to
collect data on the types of illnesses or sickness, the number of morbid indi-
viduals, treatment method, effectiveness of the treatment, follow —up meth—
ods, if any, and other related information. The government, financed bodies
and private institutions or organizations can conduct surveys. Since surveys
can be expensive, large surveys are usually taken up by the government and
related agencies, whereas private bodies generally conduct small surveys.
 </p>

<p>
MEASURES OF MORTALITY

There are different ways in which data on mortality is measured and anal-
ysed. Some of the important ways of measuring mortality are discussed in
this section.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00097">97</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:97
</h1>
<p>
Crude Death Rate (CDR)/ Crude Mortality Rate

Crude death rate is the ratio of the number of deaths, which occur in a popu-
lation during a calendar year to the total mid-year population in that year. It

is calculated as follows:

Crude death rate = Death/ Population X 1000

It is also denoted by the formula:

CDR = D/K X 1000

where,
D = Deaths registered in a year; and
K = Population of an area in that year.

This is the easiest method of calculating the mortality rate, and has the fol-
lowing advantages:

i. It is the simplest method of calculating death rates.

ii. It makes it possible to reduce the death rate to one figure.

iii. Not many details are required.

iv. The least amount of vital statistics is needed.

V. It is the most widely accepted indices of mortality.

This method also has the following disadvantages:

i. Many population groups that have variations in death rates are com—
bined together.

ii. Variations in death rates are not taken into consideration.

iii. CDRs do not indicate the rates of occurrence of events, but mixes
them up with changes in population size.

iv. This rate does not actually reveal whether deaths have taken place at
the beginning of the year or the end of the year.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00098">98</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:98
</h1>
<p>
Average Crude Death Rate (ACDR)

In many countries, the death rates experience considerable ﬂuctuations. In
order to get a realistic picture of the crude death rates, an average of the
CDRs of three years is calculated as follows:

ACDR = D2/P2 X1000

where,
D2 = Deaths in the population in the second year (of the chosen three
years); and
P2 = Population in the second year.

The ACDR can also be calculated using the following formulae:

ACDR = 1/3(D1+D2 +D3)/ P2 X 1000

or                	D2 /1/3(P1+P2 +P3) X 1000

or                	D1 + D2 + D3/ P1+P2 +P3   X 1000

Age- specific Death Rate (ASDR)

Mortality rates vary across age groups. Through ASFR, death rates can be
calculated according to different age groups. It is calculated as:

ASFR = Number of deaths in a specific age group in a population in a year/ Total population of that specific age group x1000

Theformula can be represented as

ASFR: = D5-10 / P5-10 x1000
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00099">99</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 99
</h1>
<p>
Where,
D5_10 = Number of deaths in a population in a particular age group, say
    	5— 10; and
P5_10 = Population of the specific age group.

<p>

Cause- specific Death Rate (CSDR)

Cause- specific death rate is calculated to find Out the death rates across
various causes, and the factors that cause maximum deaths; Such data will
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000102">102</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:102
</h1>
<p>
be helpful in dealing with the causes and controlling the number of deaths
resulting from them. CSDR is calculated as follows:

CSDR =Number of deaths occuring due to a particular cause in a year/ Total population in that year X 1000

There are many causes of death— some common, some not very common
and still others rare. Sometimes, it is difficult to ascertain the exact cause
of death. The WHO has attempted to categorize the causes of deaths as
follows:

i. Infections, parasitic and respiratory diseases
ii. Diseases of the circulatory system
iii. Cancer
iv. Death from violence
V. Others including gastro-intestinal diseases, diabetes mellitus, birth
injuries, and diseases peculiar to the first few weeks of life
</p>

<p>
Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)

In demographic term, infants are defined as an exact age group, age ‘zero’,
or those children in the first year of life, who have not yet completed age
one. In many societies, infants are the most vulnerable to health problems
and socio-economic conditions, and many fall prey to them. Infant mortal-
ity refers to the death of those infants who have not reached age one. The
method of calculating infant mortality is as follows:


IMR = D0-1/B X 1OOO

where,
D0-1= Death in the age group 0-1; and
B = Total registered births in an year.

In order to calculate the neonatal mortality rate (rate of death of infants)
before they complete four months of their lives, the following formula is
used:

IMR = D0-4m/ B x1000

where,
D0_4m = Death of infants within four months of their birth; and
B = Total registered births in a year.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000103">103</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 103
</h1>
<p>
For calculating the post- neonatal mortality rate, the following method is
used:

IMR =  D4m-12m/ P X 1000

where,
D4m_12m = Number of deaths of infants between 4 months and 12 months
      	of age; and
B = Total number of registered births in an year.
 </p>


 <p>
Child Mortality Rate (CMR)

Child mortality rate is the rate at which children below the age of five die in
a population. CMR is computed as follows:
 Child mortality rate

 = Number of deaths of children below the age of5/Total population of children below the age of 5 X1000

                   	CMR = D0-5/P0-5 x1000

where,
D00-5 = Death of children below the age of 5 years; and
P0-5 = Population of children below the age of 5 years.

 INFANT MORTALITY

  One of the most serious issues that many countries are facing today is the
problem of infant mortality. In many developing and underdeveloped coun-
tries, IMR even today continues to be high, indicating low socio-economic
levels of develOpment. As mentioned earlier, infant mortality can occur dur-
ing the neonatal phase when an infant is less than four months old, and
the post— neonatal phase, which includes the period between 4 months and
12 months. The second phase is critical in the life of an infant. In the first
phase, the infants are protected from the outside environment, and are usu-
ally breastfed, which protects them from infections. In the second phase,
however, the infants enter the outside environment, and are affected by the
surrounding air, food and other elements that are carriers of diseases and
infections.

The following are the two factors that result in infant mortality:

. Endogenous factors: These factors relate to the formation of the foe-
tus and are biological in nature. These factors include the age of the

<p>
mother, health of mother, birth order, period of spacing between chil-
dren, premature births, weight of infant at time of birth, congenital
diseases and so on.

. Exogenous factors: These factors are the outside factors and are
socio-economic and cultural factors that influence mortality. These
include faulty feeding system, lack of proper or adequate nutrition,
exposure to extremities of climate, poor hygiene, diseases and infec-
tions, and so on.
 </p>

<p>
Causes for High Infant Mortality

Although there are variations in the infant mortality rates across the world,
no country is free from it. In the developing and underdeveloped nations,
infant mortality continues to be high despite advances in medical and health
services. The reasons for this are as follows:

i. Causes related to birth, such as birth order, mother’s age and health at
the time of birth, premature birth, incompetence of nurses and doc—
tors attending to the mother and child, congenital diseases, lack of
proper medical facilities and so on.

ii. Exogenous or outside factors, such as negligence of infants, pollution
and unsanitary living conditions, illiteracy of parents and so on.

iii. Poverty, which results in lack of proper nutrition for the infants.

iv. Social customs, which lead to neglect of the girl child.

v. Lack of proper care in the earliest period of life.

vi. Ignorance on the part of parents regarding proper care of infants.

vii. SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, by which for inexplicable
reasons, infants die. This is also prevalent in developed countries,
where it accounts for a certain percentage of infant deaths.

viii. Spread of contagious diseases, though most epidemics have been
brought under control in many parts of the world.

ix. Lack of proper facilities or money to immunize infants from various
diseases.
 </p>

<p>
Infant Mortality in India

India is a country with high infant mortality rate. Poverty, illiteracy, social
conditions, low status of women, lack of proper care of infants and several
other causes have contributed to high infant mortality. The social and eco-
nomic conditions have not been favourable to the girl child, and despite there
being more number of female children at birth in comparison to males, the
female sex ratio continues to be negative.

Child mortality refers to the number of children who die before their
fifth birthday, and is measured per 1000 live births. In 2002, the most
recent year for which comprehensive data is available, industrialized coun-
tries had an average child mortality rate of 7 deaths per 1000 live births;
the least developed countries had a rate of 158 deaths per 1000 births.
Child mortality rates are a UNICEF yardstick for measuring a country’s
advancement.
</p>

<p>
   In the developing countries, More than 10 million children die each
year. A majority die from causes preventable through a combination of good
care, nutrition and medical treatment. Although the mortality rates for chil-
dren below 5 years dropped by 15 per cent since 1990, these rates continue
to remain high.
</p>

<p>
   Statistics show that in developing countries, one in every ten children
2 dies before its fifth birthday, compared with 1 in 143 in high- income coun-
tries. Although the child deaths have declined rapidly in the past 25 years,
this trend started reversing in a few countries during the 1990s. At current
levels of decline, only a few countries are likely to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal of the United Nations and the WHO of reducing child
mortality to one- third of their 1990 levels. No region, except possibly Latin
America and the Caribbean, is on track to achieve the target of reducing,
by 2015, the under- five mortality rates by two- thirds of their 1990 levels.
Progress in this direction has been particularly slow in Sub— Saharan Africa,
where civil disturbances and the HIV/ AIDS epidemic have driven up rates
of infant and child mortality in several countries.
</p>

<p>
   In low- income countries, the average under- five mortality rate was 121
deaths per 1000 live births in 2002. In 2002, 48 countries had child mortality
rates greater than 100 per 1000 live births. 15 countries—14 in Sub- Saharan
Africa— had mortality rates of more than 200. In lower- middle- income
countries, this figure was 40, and in upper —middle —income countries it Was
22. In high- income countries, the rate was less than 7. Approximately 70 per
cent of the deaths before age five are caused by a disease or a combination
of diseases and malnutrition that would be preventable in a high- income
country. These include acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles and
malaria. A major cause of child mortality is malnutrition, which weakens
children and reduces their resistance to disease, and accounts for more than
half of all child deaths. Another major stakeholder in child and infant mor-
tality is measles, a disease that caused over half a million deaths in 2000.
Deaths due to measles can be reduced by increased routine measles immu-
nization to at least 90 per cent coverage in all countries combined with a
‘second opportunity’ for measles vaccination either through a second dose
in the routine immunization schedule or the supplemental immunization
activities.

<p>
MATERNAL MORTALITY

The Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-1O)
defines a maternal death as ‘the death of a woman while pregnant or Within
42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of
the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or
its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.’
 </p>

<p>
The 42—day limit is somewhat arbitrary, and in recognition of the fact
that modern life- sustaining procedures and technologies can prolong dying
and delay death, ICD- 10 introduced a new category, namely the late mater-
nal death, which is defined as the death of a woman from direCt or indirect
obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than one year after termination
of pregnancy.
 </p>

<p>
According to ICD-1O, maternal deaths are divided into two groups:
direct obstetric deaths and indirect obstetric deaths.
 </p>

<p>
Direct obstetric deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications
of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and the puerperium), from inter-
ventions, omissions, incorrect treatment or from a chain of events resulting
from any of the above.
 </p>

<p>
Indirect obstetric deaths are those resulting from the previous exist—
ing disease or diseases that developed during pregnancy and which was not
due to direct obstetric causes, but was aggravated by physiologic effects of
pregnancy.
 </p>

<p>
The drawback of this definition is that maternal deaths can escape being
so classified because the precise cause Of death cannot be given even though
the fact of the woman having been pregnant is known. Such under- registra-
tion is frequent in both developing and developed countries. Deaths from
‘accidental or incidental” causes have historically been excluded from mater-
nal mortality statistics. However, in practice, the distinction between inci-
dental and indirect causes of death is difficult to make.
 </p>

<p>
To facilitate the identification of maternal deaths in circumstances where
cause of death attribution is inadequate, ICD- 10 introduced a new category,
that of pregnancy —related death, which is defined as: the death of a woman
while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective
of the cause of death.
 </p>

<p>
Why do Mothers Die?

The high rates of maternal mortality throughout much of the developing
world are the result- of serious neglect of women’s reproductive health, par-
ticularly for the poor women, as well as ineffective interventions.

. Even where fertility rates are low, the timing and spacing of pregnan—
cies, and the extent to which the births are wanted, warrant attention.

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000109">109</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:109
</h1>
<p>
 Greater access to family planning can help reduce the maternal mor-
tality rate by reducing the number of pregnancies.

. In addition to contraception, women need access to a broad range of
services. The primary means of preventing maternal  deaths is to pro-
vide rapid access to emergency obstetrical care, including treatment
of haemorrhages, infections, hypertension and obstructed labour. It is
also important to ensure that a midwife or doctor is present at every
delivery. In developing countries, only about half of deliveries are
attended by professional health staff.

. Skilled attendants must be supported by the right environment.
Life-saving interventions —antibiotics,  surgery and transportation
to medical centres — are unavailable to many women, especially in
rural areas. These women may lack the money for health care and
transport, or they may simply lack their husbands’ permission to
seek care.

. Pregnancy- related complications claim the lives of an estimated
5,15,000 women worldwide every year, with most of these deaths
occurring in the developing world. For women in industrialized
countries, the lifetime risk of death from pregnancy complications is
1 in 4085, but that risk for women worldwide is 1 in 75.

. Haemorrhage is the leading cause of pregnancy -related deaths, fol-
lowed by infection. Other causes include obstructed labour, eclamp-
sia, and other hypertension- related disorders. The majority of these
deaths could be prevented with access to quality emergency obstetric
care. Furthermore, family planning services can play a major role in
preventing maternal deaths by reducing health risks associated with
unplanned pregnancy.
</p>

<p>
Maternal Mortality in India

With 16 per cent of the world’s population, India accounts for over 20 per
cent of the world’s maternal deaths. The maternal mortality ratio, defined as
the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births, is incredibly high at
408 per 1,00,000 live births for the country (G01 1997), which is unaccept-
able when compared to current indices elsewhere in Asia. Within India, the
interstate differentials are a matter of concern, Kerala has the lowest mater-
nal mortality rate, whereas Uttar Pradesh has the highest. The states in which
female education and employment is low, the status of women is low, age at
marriage is high for women, and there is limited or no family planning and
use of birth control measures have recorded high maternal mortality rates.
Kerala is a pioneering state in many ways —it is one of the few states in the
country which has a positive female sex ratio, high women’s education levels,
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000110">110</pagenum>

<p>

 high female employment and a better status for women in general than in
most other states in the country. These are the reasons for a low maternal
mortality rate in the state of Kerala.
</p>

<p>
India: Life Expectancy at Birth

Between the life processes of birth and death is life. Life expectancy at birth
refers to the number of years an individual or a group is excepted to live at
the time of birth. Life expectancy refers to the number of years an infant
born Within a defined population may be expected to live based on the con-
ditions prevailing in that society at the time of its birth.

Total population: 62.5 years
Male: 61.89 years
Female: 63.13 years (2000 est.)

Human beings are mortal —they all have to die. Mortality refers to the death
of an individual, a state where all signs of life cease. It has many causes and
variations. Mortality transition has resulted in changes in mortality rates
across the world. In many countries, mortality rates have been steadily
declining, though not at the speed at which expected. Although mortality
affects all categories of human beings, emphasis is laid on infant and child
mortality, as well as maternal mortality. The trends in these aspects are cause
of concern to demographers and policy makers across the world.
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY

. Mortality is a biological and demographic process that has a tremen-
dous impact on population, and affects and influences the growth rate
of population, as well as fertility rates. Mortality refers to death, or the
end of life. Morbidity refers to a state in which a person is alive, but
is not able to do anything productive, or any physical, economic or
social work.

. Life expectancy at birth refers to the number of years an individual or
a group is expected to live at the time of birth. It varies within coun-
tries as well as across countries; there are rural— urban differentials
and differences.

. Mortality rates have undergone several changes, and mortality transi-
tions have resulted in declining death rates in many countries, though
in some countries this decline has not been as expected.

.Mortality rates can be calculated by using various methods. These
include crude death rate, average crude death rate, age- specific deaths

<p>
rate, cause- specific death rate, infant mortality rate and child mortal—
ity rate.

. Infant mortality refers to the death of infants below the age of one.
Neonatal infant mortality occurs within 4 months of an infant’s birth,
and post- neonatal infant mortality takes place between 4 and 12
months. There are various causes of infant mortality, including health
of mother, improper pre—natal and neonatal care, congenital prob-
lems, unhygienic surroundings, susceptibility to diseases and so on.

. Infant mortality and child mortality rates are high in India. There are
variations in these rates between states, as there are» rural —urban dif-
ferentials and male— female differentials.

. Maternal mortality is another important aspect of mortality. It is
defined as the death of women up to 42 days after Childbirth or termi—
nation of pregnancy. Causes of maternal mortality include the health
of mother, the number of children and spacing between children,
pre- and post-natal care, pregnancy- related problems, lack of prOper
nutritional food and so on.

Theories of PopulatiOn ,Page no:113

<p>
  After reading this chapter, you will be conversant with:
 . Pre - Malthusian Population Theories in the Early Periods
 - Population Philosophy During the Middle Ages
 - Malthusian Theory of Population Growth
 - Theory of Demographic Transition
</p>

<p>
 INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of demographic and population studies, several theories
have been advocated about population differentials, increase or decrease in
population, growth rate of population and various other aspects. These theo-
ries also look into the causes and consequences of less or more population.
Various theories present different viewpoints, since they relate to the size
and growth of human populations. Some earlier theories advocated a large
population with a rapid growth rate, since it was considered to be a source of
a nation’s strength and wealth, and a useful factor underlying technological
development. On the other hand, a large population has been conSidered
to be an important factor resulting in poverty, unemployment and various
other social and economic problems such as low per capita income, low lit-
eracy rates, low level of economic development and so on.
</p>

<p>
Ancient philosophers, statesmen and thinkers debated the question of
the desirable size of population, and the need for encouraging or discourag-
ing population growth. Such concern was based on military, political, eco-
nomic and social issues, and usually resulted in the formulation of a specific
population policy. The- first scientific population theory emerged only in the
eighteenth century with the publication of the work of Thomas Malthus.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, population theories will be discussed in relation to the
early periods, followed by the pre-Malthusian theories, the Malthusian
</p>

<p>
theory and the post- Malthusian theories, which include the demographic
transition theory, the theory of optimum population, and various biological,
social and economic theories.
</p>

<p>
PRE- MALTHUSIAN POPULATION THEORIES IN THE EARLY PERIODS

Several population theories preceded the Malthusian theory of population
growth. These can be classified into Greek and Roman thoughts, population
theories during the Middle Ages and ideas of Physiocrats and Mercantilists.
The early theories on population discussed various aspects of population
size and growth. They were based on the existing social, economic and polit—
ical conditions of the period.
</p>

<p>
Chinese Thought on Population

The famous Chinese philosopher Confucius and other population thinkers
had given a considerable thought to the idea of optimum population, espe-
cially since China was an agricultural nation. They also debated on the issue
of population growth in relation to the availability of resources, as well as
various methods of putting checks on population growth. The basic views of
Confucius on marriage, family and procreation favoured large families and
increase in population.
</p>

<p>
Greek Thought on Population

In the Greek scheme of political life, the individual was only a part of the
state, and was subordinate to it. The institution of marriage was considered
important, and emphasis was laid on procreation. Constant wars depleted
the population, and there was a constant demand for manpower. In Sparta,
marriage was compulsory and celibacy Was punishable by law.
</p>


<p>
Plato and Aristotle believed that, limited population Would ensure hap-
piness in a society, though a low population could make the society poor.
The laws of succession and inheritance should avoid sharp variances in fam-
ily or property structure. The childless should be permitted to adopt chil—
dren. Abnormal population growth could be checked through the practice
of celibacy. They also emphasized on the establishment of new colonies.
They believed that the low growth rate of population could be dealt with by
giving suitable rewards to the people in order to have sustained growth rate
of population. Both Aristotle and Plato believed that population and poverty
were directly related. Plato also believed that maintaining population equi-
libriums was necessary for sustaining social equilibrium. He stated that for
the highest good’ to be achieved, every city— state should have 5040 citizens,

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000115">115</pagenum>

Page no:115
</h1>
<p>
 and houses, land and property should be equally divided between them. This
ideal population advocated by Plato did not include women, children and
slaves. With their inclusion, the population would reach 50,000.
 </p>

<p>
	Other important Greek thinkers who discussed population issues
included Herodotus, Thucidides and Xenophon. Xenophon believed that a
large population was essential for the division of labour. He also advocated
the removal of all restrictions on immigration and emigration The Greeks
emphasized on maintaining a population size that was adequate for a city-
state. The quality of the population was also given importance.
 </p>

<p>
	Early thinkers believed that in order to remove poverty, it was impera-
tive that the state should take steps for increasing the income of the people.
One of the methods suggested was the removal of all state restrictions on
the coming of the foreigners in the country, and provide them all facilities in
order to increase international trade. This would increase profit, trade and
peace between the countries.
 </p>

<p>
Roman Thinkers of Population

Romans did not favour city -states; they believed in nation states— big states
and empires. The problem of population, size and growth was not given
much importance. Romans were men of action, warriors and statesmen.
They believed that a large population would enable the states to have more
soldiers to fight and help in the expansion of empire. Cicero, an important
Roman thinker, did not faVour the use of artificial means and methods for
checking population growth.
 </p>

<p>
POPULATION PHILOSOPHY DURING THE MIDDLE AGES

The Middle Ages can be divided into two parts —the periods from 400—1200
CE and 1200—1500 CE. During this period, Christian thinkers took a moral
View of the population problem. They advocated control of passions and
bachelorhood, while opposing divOrce, killing of children, abortion, etc.
It was believed that to a considerable extent, nature and natural calamities
could reduce population. High birth rates were advocated to counter the high
death rates resulting from natural calamities, and to keep the population at a
particular level. The Muslims and the Mercantilists believed in a high growth
rate of population, as more manpower wOuld lead to an increase in produc-
tion and demand fOr finished goods for consumption. Irrespective of the liv-
ing standards Of the people, high birth rates were advocated. The growth
of population would be controlled by the Spread of diseases, abortions, late
marriages, etc. People also believed that birth and death rates were predes-
tined, and efforts to check these would be futile. Since people were believed
 </p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000116">116</pagenum>
<h1>
    Page no:116
</h1>
<p>
to be the real strength of a country, the growth rate of population was not to
be checked. Moreover, attempts to check population would only prove to be
a hindrance to God’s will and as such, population growth was in the interest
of the society as a whole. However, there were some thinkers who believed
that population growth not only gave strength to a nation, but also created
several problems for the country.
 </p>


<p>
 Mercantilists

 	During the sixteenth century, the Mercantilist philosophy gained popularity.
Mercantilism is considered to be a link between the medieval and modern
periOd. The Mercantilists were primarily in favour of increased population.
Important philosophers included B. Colbest, Charles Devant and John Locke.
They stated that real happiness came with trade, because it was a means of
earning wealth. Development of trade and industry would take place only
if there was enough population, and therefore the more the population, the
more is the possibility of increased trade and commerce.
 </p>

<p>
The Mercantilists believed that a nation’s wealth was vested in the quality
of precious metals such as gold and silver in its possession. Countries that did
not possess gold or silver mines could earn the wealth by achieving a favour-
able balance of trade through more exports and less imports. This would result
in addition of gold and silver to the country’ s coffers. To increase exports,
more production was necessary, fOr which more people were required. This
increase in demand for workers necessitated an increase in population. More
manpower would result in less wages and hence more profits and production.
Both the society and individual shall have more income. In fact, the excess
population would be automatically checked by nature, and there would be no
need fOr any artificial means of checking population. More population was
also necessary to form the military for defending a country.
 </p>

<p>
Adopting certain fertility- encouraging meaSures could increase the birth
rates. These included placing disabilities on celibates, directly encouraging
marriages, encouraging fertility, decreasing or abolishing the punishments for
illegitimate births, and encouraging immigration and prevailing emigration.
 </p>

 <p>
Important Mercantilist thinkers included Niccillo Machiavelli and
Giovanni Botero. MaChiavelli observed that excessive population would
diminish through disease and want. Botero studied population in a broad
scientific manner. According to him, population would increase for some
time, but not continue to increase at the same rate. Over a period of time,
it would slow down or even decline. This decline would be caused by the
limitations imposed on the growth of population by the limited means of
subsistence available to humanity, which would act as a primary check on
population growth. Secondary checks included sterility of the soil, diseases,
epidemics and bad climate.
 </p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000117">117</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
Physiocrats

The Physiocrats belonged to France, and evolved in the mid-eighteenth
century in opposition to Mercantilist policies and ideas. F. Quensay, Robet
Turgot and Marquis Reviere, among others, did not believe that there should
be any check on population growth, as population was a source of strength.
It also caused misery and hardships. They did not favour unnatural means of
checking populatiOn growth.
</p>

<p>
Quesnay was the founder of the Physiocratic School. He believed that a
large population was desirable only if it could be comfortably maintained.
Reviere was of the opinion that in a well- administered state, population
would not increase faster than the means of subsistence. Mirabeau opined
that a large population would be desirable for the State, but agriculture should
be encouraged in order to feed the large population. According to Cantillon,
land or soil was the primary factor in the production of wealth, and the size
of agricultural production would determine the size of the population.
</p>

<p>
MALTHUSIAN THEORY OF POPULATION GROWTH

Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1766—1834) was an English
demographer and political economist, known for his pes-
simistic but highly influential views. Malthus was born in
a prosperous family. His father was a personal friend of
the philosopher and sceptic David Hume and an acquain-
tance of Jean— Jacques Rousseau. Malthus received his early
education at home, and took admission to Jesus College,
Cambridge in 1784. His main subject was Mathematics, in
which he earned a masters degree in 1791. He was elected
as a fellow of Jesus College in 1793. In 1797, he was ordained and became
a country parson. Malthus married in 1804; he and his wife had three chil-
dren. In 1805, he became Britain’s (and possibly the world’s) first professor
in political economy at the East India Company College at Haileybury in
Hertfordshire. Here, he developed a theory of demand supply mismatches,
which he called gluts. He died in 1834, and was buried at Bath Abbey in
England.
</p>

<p>
Malthus’s views were largely developed in reaction to the optimistic views
of his father and his associates, notably Rousseau and William Godwin. He
gave his ideas in his Economics of Geography in 1798, when he was working
as a priest. His views came to be widely known as the society in An Essay on
the Principles of Population -As it Affects the Future Improvement of Society,
with remarks on the Speculation of Mr. Godwin. In 1805, he wrote his famous
essay entitled An Essay on the Principles of Population or a View of its Past
and Present Effects on Human Happiness. Malthus was of the opinion that
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000118">118</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:118
</h1>
<p>
populatiOn would outpace foOd supply, leading to a decrease in food per
person. This prediction was based on the idea that population, if unchecked,
increases at a geometric rate whereas the food supply grows at an arithmetic
rate. (See Malthusian catastrophe for more information.) Only misery, moral
restraint and vice (which for Malthus included contraception) could check
excessive population growth. Malthus favoured ‘moral restraint’ (including
late marriage and sexual abstinence) as a check on population growth.
 </p>

  <p>
                      	Box 5.1
 Malthus was a political economist who was concerned about, what
 he saw as, the decline of living conditions in the nineteenth century
 England. He blamed this decline on three elements: The overproduc
 tion of young; the inability of resources to keep up with the rising
 human population; and the irresponsibility of the lower classes. To
 combat this, Malthus suggested the family size of the lower class ought
 to be regulated such that poor families do not produce more children
 than they can support
  </p>

 <p> Source: http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/malthus.html  </p>

 <p>

Up to the period When Malthus started debating the population issue,
the general idea was that population was in no way harmful to the soci-
ety. However, Malthus stated that both the governments and the propertied
class were supporting populatiOn growth, as both had their own interests
at stake. The government would get more soldiers for the army, and the
propertied class would acquire labour at cheap rates. He felt that growing
population was mainly responsible for growing poverty, unemployment and
health problems and diseases. His theory of population growth and its con-
sequences are based on these ideas.
 </p>


 <p>
Basic Assumptions of Malthusian Theory

Before formulating his theory, Malthus visited some Western countries to
collect population data and developed certain basic assumptions, which are
as follows (Raj 2003):

i. Human beings have great potentialities to produce children.
ii. In agriculture, Law of Diminishing Returns operates.
iii. Human beings need food to eat.
iv. Passion between the sexes is increasing and unavoidable.

These assumptions are diScussed in detail in Malthus’s work Essay on
Population. Thus, the basic postulate of his theory is that food is necessary
for human existence, and that passion between the sexes is necessary and
will remain so in the present. Malthus stated that the attraction between
males and females is natural and immanent, and the Sexes will continue to
attract each other. According to him, it! is almost difficult to control the birth
of children when the couples meet. Thus, there are two principal hungers
that nature has instilled in humans— the hunger for food and that for sex.
Malthus was of the view that neither of these hungers could ever be quelled
or controlled. After accepting that the two laws are fixed by nature, Malthus
stated (Bhende and Kanitkar 1991), ‘Assuming then my postulate as granted,
say that the power of population is definitely greater than the power in the
earth to produce subsistence for man. Population, when unchecked, increases
in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A
slight acquaintance with numbers will show the immensity of the first power
in comparison with the second’. According to Malthus, population could be
expected to double itself in 25 years. On the basis of the population data
collected, he concluded that population was growing in a geometrical ratio,
i.e., in the ratio of 1:2:4:8:16:32:64 and so on. After 2000 years, it will become
difficult to calculate the world population. He considered this a very serious
problem, as prosperity was not to depend on population, but population was
to depend on prosperity.
</p>

<p>
Rate of Increase of Food

  Any population needs food to survive. However, an increase in food
production is much less than the increase in population. Malthus stated that
while population was growing in a geometrical ratio, food production was
increasing in an arithmetical ratio, i.e., in the ratio of 1:2:3:4:5:6 and so on.
He concluded that on the basis of the  present average state of the earth, the
pace of food production cannot be possibly increased than its present pace.
In fact, if the increase in population was not checked, there was bound to be
shortage of food. He made it clear that ‘the Table of Nature is laid for a lim-
ited number of guests and those who come un-invited must starve’.

<p>

Malthus predicted that the rates of growth of population and food
production would create disequilibrium between the two, and that the stan-
dard of living of the people would definitely come down. This trend is surely
harmful for the society as a whole. He also believed that food production
could not be increased all of a sudden, as and when people liked. Continued
disequilibria could disturb the world order and inundate the universe with
miseries, continued physical restraints and constraints. The means of sub-
sistence would necessarily limit the population.
  </p>

<p>
Some Propositions

In one of the chapters in the Essay, Malthus put forward certain proposi—
tions, which were as follows:

i. Population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence.

ii. Population invariably increases while the means of subsistence
increases unless prevented by some very powerful and obvious checks.

iii. These checks, which repress the superior power of population and its
effects on a level with the means of subsistence, are all resolvable into
moral restraint, vice and misery.
  </p>

<p>
                         	Box 5.2

‘Since population tends to press to the limit of available subsistence;
since the power of production is beyond all comparison weaker than
the power of reproduction; and since the equilibrium between popula-
tion and resources can be maintained only by the conStant operation
of various checks, all of which are kind of either vice or misery, then
population will always grow until there is enough misery or enough
vice or more likely a sufficient mixture of both to achieve equilibrium.’

Checks on Population

Unprecedented population growth leads to problems and miseries. Malthus
stated that it was important to control population through certain checks,
which are as follows:

i. Positive checks: Positive checks tended to shorten human life.
Malthus divided them into two categories --those brought about by
natural causes, and those brought upon humankind by themselves.
  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000121">121</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
According to Malthus, nature has a very limited table. If population
continued to increase at the present growth, it would exceed food
availability. He was, therefore, convinced that it was imperative to
control growth rate of population, as unchecked growth of popula-
tion would result in severe food problem. From time to time, nature
imposes and applies certain checks to control growing population, in
the form of diseases, starvations, famines and various natural calami-
ties such as earthquakes, floods, etc. Malthus believed that nature had
a way of adjusting pOpulation according to the availability of food.
He named these checks as positive checks or the checks impOsed on
population by nature to control its growth.
 </p>

<p>
There are certain positive checks created by humankind, which include
wars, excesses of various kinds, bad working conditions and unwhole-
some occupations, severe labour, exposure to extremities of climate
and so on.
 </p>

<p>
ii. Preventive checks: Malthus stressed on the fact that the restrictions
imposed by nature to check populations were terrible, and advised
that people should themselves impose restraints so that nature was
not forced to impose it on them. People must realize that by not
checking their population, they themselves were becoming the cause
of their poverty and misery. He called the checks imposed by people
on themselves to control population growth as preventive checks,
and advocated that people should always prefer preventive checks
to nature’s horrifying checks. Self- imposed checks included restraint
from marriage, celibacy and moral restraint/ self- restraint, as people
should not in any Way indulge in immOral acts that result in produc-
tion of children. However, he advocated vice as a voluntary check on
controlling births. In fact, Malthus advocated self- restraint over the
use of contraceptives or abortions. He also believed in late marriages,
around the age of 27— 28.
 </p>

<p>
According to Malthus, migration of population was likely to temporarily
solve the food problem of a country. Emigration Or the migratiOn of peo-
ple to other countries Would be advantageous for poor nations, in terms of
availability of food. Though specialization in agriculture and production of
finished products were useful for a nation, nations that are industrially and
commercially advanced could purchase food from agriculturally advanced
nations to the extent needed.
 </p>

<p>
Malthus was vociferous in his disfavour of the Poor Laws, or laws that
provided relief to the poor. He considered poverty to be an evil that only
the poor could remedy by delaying or avoiding marriage. He advocated the
abolition of the Poor Laws, and also suggested that the poor should not
marry.

              	Box 5.3 Malthus on the Poor Laws

‘The poor -laws of England tend to depress the general condition of the poor in two
ways. The first obvious tendency is to increase population without increasing the food
for its support. A poor man may marry with little or no prospect of being able to sup-
port a family in independence. He may be said therefore in some measure to create the
poor which they maintain; and as the provisions of the country must, in consequence
of the increased population, be distributed to every man in smaller proportions, it is
eVident that the labor of those who are not supported by parish assistance will purchase
a smaller quantity of provisions than before, and consequently, more of them must be
driven to ask for support. Secondly, the quantity of provisions consumed in workhouses
upon a part of the society, that cannot in general be considered the most valuable part,
diminishes the shares that would otherwise belong to more worthy members; and thus
in the same manner forces more to become dependent ... other circumstances being
the same, it may be affirmed that countries are populous according to the quantity of
human food which they produce or can acquire, and happy according to the liberality
with which this food is divided, or the quantity which a day’s labor will purchase. Corn
countries are more populous than pasture countries, and rice countries are more popu—
lous than corn countries. But their happiness does not depend upon their being thinly
or fully inhabited, upon their poverty or their richness, their youth or their age, but on
the proportion which the population and the good bear to each other.’

<p>
The time and period when Malthus brought out his work should be taken
into consideration while analysing his ideas on the Poor Laws. The poor,
especially those in the rural areas, were numerous, and living in a pathetic
state. It was believed that the plight of the poor was mainly due to the landed
aristocracy, which controlled the government, and used it to advance the
upper classes at the expense of the poor.
</p>

<p>
Malthusian theory of population growth had considerable influence On
the demographic, social as well as political arenas. High fertility, which had
been considered an economic asset as it increased the number of workers
available to the economy, began to be considered a liability which tended
to reduce per capita output even though it increased gross output. In the
1830s, his writings strongly influenced political thinkers and brought in
changes in the Poor Laws through the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.
Malthus’s theory had significant influence on both the cofounders of mod—
ern evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. In fact,
in his book, The Origin of Species, Darwin described his theory as an applica—
tion of the doctrines of Malthus without the complicating factor of human

<p>
intelligence. Concerns about Malthuss theory also helped to promote the
idea of a national population Census in the UK.
 </p>

<p>
A Critique of Malthusian Theory

The theory of population growth propounded by Malthus won accolades
as well as brickbats. It changed the way countries looked at the population
issue. It was controversial not only during Malthuss own times, but also is
still open to criticism.

i. Malthus was a realist who was severely criticized by idealists.
According to his biographer James Bonar, ‘For thirty years it rained
refutations. Malthus was the most abused man of the age, put down
as a man who defended smallpox, slavery and child murder, who
denounced soup kitchens, early marriage and parish allowances; who
had the impudence to marry after preaching against the evils of a
family; who thought the world so badly governed that the best actions
do the most harm; who, in short, took all romance out of life.’

ii. William Hazlitt was one of the critics at odds with the Malthusian the-
ory as expressed by Malthus. Hazlitt questions the fact that Malthus
had accepted his opponent’s (Godwin’s) position of a state of perfect—
ibility (perfection) as achievable. He assumed that in such a state, the
general good is to obtain the entire mastery of individual interests,
over gross appetites and passions. He then argued that such a perfect
structure of society would fall by its own weight, or be undermined by
the principle of population. In other words, once the state of perfect-
ibility was achieved, it would be torn apart by overpopulation. Hazlitt
wondered how such a perfect society could actually come apart. He
believed that a perfect society would have a population that was fully
in control. It was beyond Hazlitt’s understanding as to how enlight-
ened, quick—sighted and public spirited people could be totally blind
to the consequences of their actions, or the impact of such actions.
Hazlitt, therefore, did not accept the premise that man was perfectible
(capable of perfection).

iii. Many critics opined that it is wrong to state that population increases
in geometrical ratio. People have become conscious of the negative
repercuSsions of large families, as well as the advantages of small fam-
ilies. This has resulted in bringing down the growth rate of population
in many countries across the world, which actually goes against the
idea of population increasing in a geometric ratio.

iv. Malthus tried to point out that every individual is interested in hav-
ing children. However, though attraction between the sexes continues

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000124">124</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:124
</h1>
<p>
   to exist, people do not necessarily want to have children, and every
marriage need not necessarily result in the birth of children. Malthus
also assumed that all the children born would survive. However, it
was seen that in countries where the birth rates are high, the death
rates are also high, leading to a balance in population.

v. Malthus’s religious beliefs prevented him from grasping the possibility
of widespread use of contraceptives. He did not foresee the increase
in the use of artificial means of birth control, which has resulted in
decreasing the growth rate of population in many countries.

vi. Malthus stated that food production would increase only in an arith-
metic ratio, whereas population would increase in a geometric ratio.
However, his prophecy of decreasing food production did not come
true, because new and scientific methods of cultivation and food pro-
duction are being used, thereby increasing the production of food
grains by several times. Most societies try to ensure that maximum
food output is available to the people. These methods include crop
rotation, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, hybrid varieties of
seeds, advanced irrigation facilities and so on.

vii. It was wrong on Malthus’s part to assume a direct link between popu-
lation growth and food increase. In many countries, the food produc-
tion is less than half of its population size, yet people in every walk
of life have sufficient food to eat. In fact, many countries, which face
shortage in production of food items, are exporting finished goods
and importing foodstuff.

viii. Malthus did not take into account the fact that population and living
standards are dependent on various factors such as favourable bal-
ance of trade, migration and so on.

ix. Malthus suggested certain unnatural methods of checking population
growth, including vice. These methods will make human behaviour
unnatural and animal-like.

x. Malthus emphasized on food production as the main means of subsis-
tence for people. This suggests that he assumed that the entire world
was vegetarian. He probably did not consider the fact that many peo-
ple across the world are non— vegetarians, and do not require food that
is produced. Therefore, food production need not necessarily limit
population.

xi. Malthus opined that a growing population was harmful for a nation.
This is not necessarily true. There are countries where manpower is
less, and where population growth is encouraged in order to meet
manpower requirements.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000125">125</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:125
</h1>
<p>
xii. Malthus explained how increasing population would pressurize
agricultural land. He placed undue emphasis on the limitation of
supply of land. He did not take into consideration vast tracts of dry,
barren land, which could be brought under cultivation. To a certain
extent, such land has helped in combating the problem of growing
population.

xiii. Malthus underestimated the importance of industrial develop-
ment. Industrialization, urbanization and increase in eduCation have
resulted in bringing down the growth rate of population in many
countries.

xiv. If Malthus’s theory were accepted, it would mean that every child
born will be considered a social curse, and that people should, in fact,
stop having children.

xv. Henry Willard and Winston Churchill have criticized Malthus by
stating that there will be a State when growth rate of population will
be automatically checked.

THEORY OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION

The theory of demographic transition is based on the stages of population
change experienced by the Western countries. During the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, industrialized Europe experienced several changes
in its population trends. There Were unprecedented declines in both mortal-
ity as well as fertility rates. Apart from these changes, industrialized Europe
also witnessed population explosion. With passage of time, there was a fur-
ther increase in rate of population growth. This was attributed to the changing
age composition of the populations caused by the initial population growth
increases. All across Western Europe, this seemingly unexplainable population
explosion coincided with the zenith of industrialization. Kirk (1996) states,
 </p>

 <p>
Demography is a science short on theory, rich in quantification.
Nevertheless, demography has produced one of the best documented
generalizations in the social sciences: the demographic transition. What is
the demographic transition? Stripped to its essentials it is the theory that
societies progress from a pre- modern regime of high fertility and high
mOrtality to a post-modern regime of low fertility and low mortality. The
cause of the transition has been sought in the reduction of the death rate by
controlling epidemic and contagious diseases.
 </p>

 <p>
An eminent demographer Frank Notestien outlined a theory which
emerged out of his observations pertaining to the effeCt of economic and
social development on the growth of population. His theory of demo-
graphic transition has prOvided the conceptual basis for demographic
researches.

<p>

According to the theory of demographic transition, all the human soci-
eties may pass through any one of the four phases at a particular point
of time. These phases are first phase or lag Phase, second phase or rapid
growth phase, third phase or stabilization phase and the fourth phase. The
change over in population dynamics from one phase to the other is called as
demographic transition.

<p>
                  	Box 5 4 The Demographic Transition Theory

 The demographic transition theory links the population increase
to economic development. This theory explains hOW after the early
Industrial Revolution, there was a huge population growth. The growth
may be due to increased employment and wages, which led to better
technological and medical advances. These advances caused a high
birth rate and low death rate because of cleaner water and modern
medicine. The Industrial Revelation led to a huge population boom.
Many believe that economics solves the population problem, but it has
not yet managed to equalize the fluctuating population growth. Birth
rates Were uSually set- off by high death rates, technology, modern med-
icine, and younger fertility rates.
 </p>

 </p>

 <p>
Demographers paid close attention to the fact that there had been a major
change in demographic history roughly coinciding with the Industrial
Revolution. By the mid-twentieth century, some countries’ total fertility rates
were getting near replacement level. Around the same time, some less devel-
oped nations were also experiencing a population explosion of their own.
Hence, in the 1940s, some demographers advanced a theory to explain pop-
ulation trends that occurred during the industrialization of Western Europe.
They tried to describe what occurred throughout Europe, and examined the
causes for such changes. The theory that examines stages of demographic
changes is known as the demographic transition theory.
 </p>

 <p>
The process of demographic transition has been explained by various
demographers. The process of demographic transition can be broadly cat-
egorized into three stages—a first stage of high birth rate and high death
rate (before the Industrial Revolution); a second stage of high birth rate and
low death rate (during industrialization), and finally to one of low birth rate
and low death rate (as a post-industrial society) (Population The Columbia
Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2004).

Blaker on Stages of Demographic Transition.
 	Blaker has classified demographic transition into five stages, which are as
follows:

First stage: This stage is also known as the high stationary stage. In this
stage, birth rate and death rate are very high, and the former exceeds the lat-
ter. Despite this, there is not much increase in the population. This stage is
found in countries that depend on agriculture as the main source of income.
Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia and many other countries are in the first stage of
transition. Up to 1920, India and China were at this stage.

Second stage: This stage is the early expanding stage. During this stage,
there is a rapid decline in the death rate, though the birth rate remains high.
The death rates start declining because of availability and use of better medi-
cal facilities and public health services. This results in population explosion
or rapid increase in population.

Third stage: This is the late expanding stage. Both the birth rate as well
as the death rate decline, though the birth rate declines gradually. A coun-
try that has attained a certain level of agricultural development and is mov-
ing toWards industrialization and urbanization will fall into this category.
Countries like Chile, Canada, Japan and the erstwhile USSR of the twentieth
century come into this category.

Fourth stage: This stage is called the low stationary stage. During this
stage, the death rate is at its lowest, and birth rates are also decreasing.
Since fertility and mortality rates are low, the growth rate of population also
decreases. The per capita income increases, there is little unemployment,
and the masses enjoy considerably high real incomes. The education levels
improve, as do the standard of living and quality of life.

Fifth stage: It is called the declining stage as the birth rate and the death
rate decline rapidly, and the birth rate falls below the death rate. This results
in a declining population. Countries such as France and Sweden are at this
stage.
 </p>

<p>
Views of ThompsOn and Notestein

Thompson and Notestein state that there are only three intermediary stages,
and not five as given by certain demographers. These stages of demographic
transition are as follows:

i. Pre- transition stage: In this stage, the birth rate is high, but as the
death rate decreases, there is rapid increase in population. There is
little control over fertility and mortality rates.

ii. Transition Stage: In this stage, both the death and birth rates decrease,
but the death rate decreases more rapidly than the birth rate. There

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000128">128</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:128
</h1>
<p>

is some control over fertility and mortality. There is slow and steady
increase in population.

iii. Post- transition stage: This is a stage in which both the birth and
death rates decrease almost equally, and population remains virtually
unchanged. Fertility and mortality both are under control.
 </p>

 <p>
Donaldson and Cowgill on Demographic Transition

Donaldson and Cowgill state five stages of demographic transition, which
are as follows:

i. First stage: This stage shows a high birth rate and initially, the death
rate is also high. The death rate starts declining, and after some time,
it begins to increase again. Such increases and decreases in the death
rate lead to fluctuations in population. When there is economic boom,
and agricultural produce is good, the death rate decreases. Famines,
droughts or floods result in increased death rate. This cycle is found
mostly in agrarian societies —countries that are basically agricultural
and industrially backward —and is dependent on food supplies.

ii. Second stage: In this stage, there is a reduction in death and birth rates.
The death rate falls at a faster rate than the birth rate. However, both
death and birth rates try to come to an equal level gradually. Employment
is available, and there are visible changes in family size and food hab-
its. Per capita income starts increasing and diseases are brought under
control. New values take the place of traditional ones, and the use of
contraceptives increases. There is relative stability in population.

iii. Third stage: This stage witnesses a very low death rate, but a very
high birth rate, mainly due to the baby boom.

iv. Fourth stage: During this stage, there is an increase in both birth
and death rates, though the birth rate increases more rapidly than the
death rate. This results in a high growth rate of population, though it
is believed that this is a rare occurrence.

v. Fifth stage: This is a stage of high fertility and low mortality. The
growth rate of population is, however, slow, mainly because of slow
decrease in the death rate in the earlier part of this stage. As time
passes, there are increases in social health services and availability of
medical services, which also result in a decline in the birth rate, and
consequently a slower growth rate of population.
 </p>

  <p>
The characteristics of population growth explained by Cowgill are as follows:

. In primitive societies, with no conception control practices, both
birth and death rates will be high and longevity will be low.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000129">129</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:129
</h1>
<p>
. Industrialization, urbanization and development of technology result
in a fall in death rates. The technology and practice of birth rate con-
trol develop after some time.

. During the period of urbanization, industrialization and develop- .
ment of technology, the extended or joint family is gradually replaced
by the nuclear family.

. With the emergence of the nuclear family, there is a decline in the
birth rate, which brings about a decline in the size of the nuclear
family.

. When a decline in the death rate permeates to the lower classes, there
is population explosion in the country.

. The upper classes are the first to use conception control devices, fol-
lowed by the middle classes and finally by the lower classes. When
the lower classes begin to use birth control measures, there is a rapid
decline in the growth rate of population, prior to which the decline
is slow.

. The urban areas first experience a fall in the birth rate. The birth rate
declines later in rural areas.

. During the period of high birth rates, female mortality remains high.
There is neglect in attitude and upkeep of girls. The female sex ratio
(number of females for every 1000 males) continues to be negative,
and there IS a domination of males over females.

. During the period of high birth rate and low death rate, health condi-
tions and life expectancy improve. The country faces the problem of
providing food, clothing, shelter and employment to people.

. Over a period of time, when old males die, the male— female ratio nor-
malizes. In urbanized and developed societies, females exceed males
because of high life expectancy.

UN on Demographic Transition

The United Nations has classified societies on the basis of population as
follows:

i. Societies that have high birth rate and high death rate

ii. Societies with high birth rate but declining death rate

iii. Societies that have high birth rate and fairly low death rate

iv. Societies with declining birth rate and low death rate

v. Societies with fluctuating birth and death rate

<p>
Stages of Demographic Transition

The demographic transition theory states that population changes can be
divided into three main stages.
 </p>
<p>
Stage I

Stage I is a period in which both high fertility and high mortality rates
prevail. The rates are usually fairly constant, and there are only a few major
fluctuations in the mortality rate as a result of events such as epidemics. In
this stage, high mortality rate deprives many households from having the
number of (surviving) children they desire, and poor health conditions
affect natural fertility. This stage represents a situation of excess demand for
children.
 </p>

<p>
Due to high mortality conditions, countries are characterized by cul-
tures and institutional structures, which promote fertility. People consider
mortality to be a phenomenon largely beyond their control. The cultures
in such nations promote fertility, aspects of which are deeply ingrained and
enforced by societal norms. Because of this, even when the reasons for high
fertility perceived households in this stage disappear, the actual practice of
high fertility is likely to continue for a considerable period.
 </p>

<p>
Even though mortality is viewed as being beyond the control of people,
the demographic transition theory presumes that all people seek good health
and long life. People rapidly adopt changes, that improve health or reduce
mortality. Due to the quick adoption of new technological and structural
methods that reduce mortality, Stage I nations experience a fairly continu—
ous and relatively sharp decline in the mortality rate beginning with the first
‘medical’ advance.
 </p>

<p>
However, in contrast to the fairly sharp and continuous decline in the
mortality rate, the fertility rate stays nearly constant during the period of
medical advances. This is because the theory assumes that cultural fertility
patterns are deep rooted, because the general public is probably unaware of
the decline in mortality rates until long after it occurs, and to be in an excess
demand situation. In other words, they are seeking more children than they
are able to bear. The main consequence of this nearly constant fertility rate
coupled with declining mortality is Stage II of the demographic transition
and the beginning of what many have termed the ‘population explosion’.
 </p>

<p>
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, countries in West Europe had high
birth and death rates. Births were high because more children meant more
workers on the farm. Since death rates were high, couples opted for more chil-
dren to ensure survival of the family. Disease and lack of hygiene accounted
for high death rates. The high birth and death rates were somewhat stable,
which resulted in slow growth of a population. Occasional epidemics would
dramatically increase the death rates for a few years.
 </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000131">131</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:131
</h1>
<p>

Stage II

Stage  of the transition starts when there is continuous decline in mortality.
In this stage, countries experience rapid population growth as a result of
the changing balance between birth and death rates. This stage witnesses
the beginning of industrialization. By the end of this stage, there is a majOr
decline in the mortality rate.
 </p>

 <p>
In the mid- eighteenth century, the death rate in West European coun-
tries declined due to improvement in sanitation and medicine. However,
birth rates remained high due to tradition and practice. This dropping death
rate, but stable and high birth rate in the beginning of Stage II contributed
to population explosion. With passage of time, children became an added
expense and were less able to contribute to the income of a family. This rea-
son, coupled with advances in birth control, resulted in reduction of the
birth rate during the twentieth century in developed countries. Populations
still grew rapidly but this growth began to slow down. Many less developed
countries are currently in Stage II of the model. For example, the crude birth
rate (CBR) in Kenya is high at 32 per 1000, and the crude death rate (CDR)
is low at 14 per 1000. This contributes to a high rate of population growth
in Kenya.
 </p>

 <p>
Stage III

Stage III witnesses a gradual decline in the fertility rate towards a low- level
equilibrium, along with a low mortality rate. The theory states that before a
country enters into Stage III, people become aware of the importance, as well
as actual decline in mortality, especially infant mortality. This knowledge
gives them the impetus to view fertility as a rational and conscious decision.
People begin to plan their families and limit fertility, by increasing the use of
artificial means of birth control. This is consciously done keeping in view the
fact that more number of children born survive, standard and cost of living,
and the desire to provide the best for children.
 </p>

 <p>
The fertility decline of Stage III is clearly slower than the decline in mor-
tality in Stage II. In fact, it has been pointed out that the decline in mortality
rate acts as a precondition for the decline in fertility rate, hinting at a relation-
ship between the decline in mortality and fertility rate. It is only after the mor-
tality rate declines and the traditional socio-economic framework changes
that a nation can undergo the fertility decline coinciding With Stage III.
 </p>

 <p>
  The socio-economic environment of countries entering this stage
encourages lower fertility to go along with the previous (Stage II) mortality
reduction. In fact, the adoption of the new smaller family norm has been
attributed to the social and economic effects of industrialization and urban—
ization. It has been argued that urban and industrial life increases contracep-
tive knowledge and availability, and also lowers the price of contraceptives.

<p>
The demographic transition theory, thus, argues that urbanization and
industrialization are the major causes of the fertility decline in the last stage.
This association between urbanization, industrialization and fertility decline
is the hallmark of the demographic transition theory.

<p>
A Critique of Demographic Transition Theory/ Critical Analysis

There are several aspects of the demographic transition theory that have
come in for criticism. Some of these aspects include:

. The demographic transition theory has little predictive or explana-
tory value. The theory could have chronicled what had actually hap-
pened to population trends during the industrialization of Europe.
In other words, if a significant mortality decline did indeed precede
a significant fertility decline. Unfortunately, the demographic transi—
tion theory does not even properly describe a large minority of the
population experiences of the developed world.

. The theory states that Stage I of an industrialized nation’s popula-
tion history consists of several important trends— an almost constant
fertility rate, and a mortality rate only affected by large-scale events
such as wars, famines and epidemics. The latter statement about the
mortality rate has come to be true, though the idea of near constant
fertility rate has not always come true.

. Standard demographic theory tells us that there are four main mecha—
nisms through which the fertility rate can be influenced or changed—
the percentage of married people in a population, the average age at
marriage, the age and gender structure/ sex ratio of the population,
and the marital fertility index. The last two factors do not seem to
have played a major role in Stage I of the fertility history of a nation.
However, the first two factors appear to be extremely important to
Stage I fertility trend changes.

. An important idea propagated by the demographic transition theory
is that there is definite causal relationship between the decline in fer-
tility and mortality rates. The theory states that the death rate or mor-
tality declines prior to the decline in the birth rate or fertility, and
that mortality decline is a prerequisite for fertility decline. In fact, the
relationship between mortality and fertility has been supported both
theoretically and statistically; however, it is only in a small minority of
cases that the major decline in mortality actually preceded the major
decline in fertility. Studies (including Francine Van de Walle’s 1986)
indicate that in general, significant fertility decline actually preceded
significant mortality decline and that the general processes of fertility
and mortality decline usually occurred simultaneously.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000133">133</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
.Since significant decline in the birth rate actually preceded decline
in the death rate, one cannot say that mortality decline has been the
most significant cause of fertility decline. It is now believed that both
declines are the result of multiple exogenous factors, some of which
stimulate both declines. This new idea represents the first major prin-
ciple of current transition theory.

.The fertility decline model of the demographic transition theory is
gaining widespread acceptance. This model calls for fertility declines
to be fairly continuous after the advent of industrialization. In fact,
urbanization and industrialization are seen as being the major causes
of fertility decline. However, during the early stages of industrializa-
tion, fertility actually exploded in many areas. The reasons for the
fertility explosion at the beginning of industrialization are as follows:

 	.  First, the urban- industrial complex has resulted in many tech—
    	nological improvements, which have decreased mortality (par-
    	ticularly infant and child) and improved the health of prospective
    	mothers. These improvements have contributed to an increase in
    	the natural supply of children. In the early stages of industrial—
    	ization (Stage II), this increase in the natural supply of children
    	raises completed fertility. However, there is also a time delay before
    	people realized that they can have more children, which results in
    	increased fertility.

 	-  The emergence of the urban- industrial complex has also resulted,
    	in several economic changes, Which are responsible for fertility
    	increases at that period of time. Immediately after the beginning
    	of industrialization, per— capita income increased. However, it was
    	not possible to know whether this increase in income would be
    	permanent or transitory. The income increase was viewed by most
    	people as transitory. Since children are a normal good, the number
    	of children demanded might temporarily increase causing another
    	reason for a surge in fertility at the advent of industrialization.

. The demographic transition theory states that the population explo-
sion that is witnessed in Stage II is the result of decline in mortality.
It is clear that an increase in fertility at the start of industrialization
contributed significantly to the population explosion. As studies have
shown, significant fertility declines usually preceded significant mor-
tality declines. Until the late nineteenth century, population explo-
sion was generally caused by fertility trends rather than mortality
trends. In many countries including the United Kingdom, it appears
that fertility has long been the controlling factor in population trends.

. Evidence indicates that ‘urbanization’ and ‘industrialization’ do not
necessarily cause fertility decline. England is a perfect example of '

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000134">134</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:134
</h1>
<p>
  how industrialization can increase fertility. The economic prosperity
associated with industrialization encouraged people to have more
children in the face of short- run income increases. In fact, urbaniza-
tion and industrialization have little or no correlation with fertility
decline.

. An important reason why urbanization and industrialization tend to
show less statistical correlation with fertility decline can be attributed
to the fact that fertility decline actually began in rural areas, espe-
cially in countries such as England and France. France was the first
country to experience significant fertility declines, and transition the-
orists found it disturbing that this decline began in rural areas. The
demographic transition theory does not help explain the importance
of rural income or the lack of a relation between urbanization, indus—
trialization and the fertility decline.

. The demographic transition theory states that the fertility decline
began in urban areas and spread to the rural areas. However, data has
also failed to show that the fertility decline spread in the other direc-
tion. In fact, urban and rural fertility declines appear, in general, to
have happened nearly simultaneously.

. Terms such as ‘urbanization’ and ‘industrialization’ encompass too
many factors to serve as useful explanatory variables of fertility declines.

. Demographic transition research has shown that fertility declines
have not been homogeneous across nations. Regional fertility dif-
ferences have been more significant than rural— urban differentials.
Current transition theory states that where we do not find significant
differences between regional fertility patterns, we should not expect
to find different local patterns of urban— rural fertility differentials.
Where regional cultural divisions are easily observable, if there is a
difference in the timing of the urban and rural fertility declines within
a given region, the urban decline occurs first. Hence, ‘urbanization’
actually does appear to have an effect on fertility when regional dif-
ferences are appropriately reckoned.

. The observance of regional differences in the fertility declines of the
demographic transition has been common to all European nations
except one. England has been a notable exception to the rule of
regional precursors. However, the English fertility decline experi-
enced a remarkable homogeneity. England did not exhibit the extreme
clustering patterns of either high or low marital fertility that were
apparent in other countries, notably Belgium, Spain and Germany.

While the demographic transition theory can be used to describe the most
probable direction in which the demographic rates evolve over time. There

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000135">135</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
are, however, exceptions to the theory, which primarily affect mortality.
Reversals in the mortality transition have been documented in association
with widespread famines and long— lasting wars, and now in many Sub-
Saharan African nations, the AIDS epidemic. For these countries, the demo-
graphic transition is stalled, if not reversed, as mortality rates Climb and life
expectancy plummets, sending countries like Botswana back from transi-
tional to early transitional status.

. Since the beginning of demographic and population studies, several
theories have been advocated about population differentials, increase
or decrease in population, growth rate of population and various
other aspects. The pre- Malthusian theories include the Greek and
Roman thought on population, influence of the Mercantilists and
Physiocrats on population change.

. The Malthusian theory on population change states that population
increases in a geometric ratio, whereas food production increases in
an arithmetic ratio. Over a period of time, this will lead to a state
where the population will outgrow the food production, and there
will be acute shortage of food in the world. Although the theory came
in for severe criticism, it is considered to be a very important theory
in the history of population studies.

. According to the demographic transition theory, populations across
the world go through several stages of transition or change. The first
stage is a stage of high birth and death rates; the second stage is one
where death rates start declining, but birth rates remain high, leading
to population increase; the third stage is one wherein the death rates
decline rapidly, and birth rates also start declining, though gradually,
leading to population explosion; in the fourth stage, both birth and
death rates decline; and the last stage is one, in which the birth rates
fall below the death rates, resulting in declining population.

 <p>
INTRODUCTION

   One of the major components apart from mortality and fertility, which affect
the population change, is ‘migration’. Migration is not a new phenomenon.
It has existed since the ancient times. Although there are no authentic
records of such migration, it is sure that people migrated from one part of
the country to the other. It is believed that most of the pre-historic period
was influenced by climate, fertility of the soil, and flora and fauna. As the
river valleys had good transportation facilities, people were more attracted
to migrate to such places. Another reason was that most of the river Valleys
served as commercial centres of business.
 </p>

 <p>
CONCEPT OF MIGRATION

Migration, together with fertility and mortality, is a fundamental element
determining population growth and structure in an area. The major difference
that characterizes the components of fertility, mortality and migration is that
while the first two are more determined by the biological factors, the last is
based entirely on the personal wishes of the persons, except in certain cases.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000138">138</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 138
</h1>
<p>
Migration is generally a deliberate movement by human beings. Thus, it is
the result of the social, economic, political and cultural circumstances to
which the human beings are exposed in their societies.
 </p>

<p>
According to the United Nations Multilingual Demographic Dictionary,
migration is defined as, ‘a form of geographical mobility or spatial mobility
between one geographical unit and another, generally involving a change
in residence from the place of origin or place of departure to the place of
destination or place of arrival. Such migration is called permanent migration
and should be distinguished from other forms of movement which do not
involve a permanent change of residence.’
 </p>

<p>
In simple terms, migration is defined as a movement from place of origin
or place of departure to a place of destination.
 </p>

<p>
Another important aspect of migration is its influence on the size of
the population. The process of migration can change the population size
drastically. On the other hand, the components of fertility and mortality do
not change the population size and structure so drastically. Thus, migration
is as important as fertility and mortality in determining the size, structure
and characteristics of the population.
 </p>

<p>
The process of migration involves interplay of demographic, economic,
social, socio- psychological and other factors. It may be over long distances
or short, it may involve a few individuals to several millions. Whatever the
nature of migration, it transforms the areas of origin and destination. Not
only is the way of life of the migrants modified, but also their metabolism
and their mentality. Thus, economic, social and cultural systems of the places
of origin and destination are transformed. Migration is also considered an
instrument of cultural diffusion and social integration resulting in a more
meaningful pattern of distribution of population.
 </p>

<p>
Migration is of interest to sociologists because they are more interested
mainly in studying the social and psychological problems associated with
it, especially those concerning migrants, the people who live in areas from
which these migrants come (sending areas) and those who live in areas
where migrants arrive (receiving areas). Data on the age, sex, mother tongue,
education and occupation of the migrants are useful to sociologists and
social psychologists, for these data enable them to plan programmes in order
to solve or control the problems arising out of migration.
 </p>

<p>
 FACTORS AFFECTING MIGRATION

Humans generally have certain motives that compel them to set out from
their places of origin to a new land. Some of the factors leading to migration
are as follows:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000139">139</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:139
</h1>
<p>
i. Absolute poverty: Dissatisfaction with ones economic status is one
of the main reasons for migration. Absolute poverty urges people to
fight out for their survival. This urge is further spurred by unexpected
events, which upset the precarious equilibrium between existence
and death. Calamities like a famine or an epidemic make it impos—
sible to survive in poverty and so man desperately seeks for alterna-
tives. Thus, migration is the most common and the easiest alternative.
Migration may be avoided mainly due to the acceptance of misery
and an attitude of apathy, which is common in such communities.

ii. Technology: People empowered with technology migrate to areas
with poor levels of technology because they can dominate or even
invade such areas easily. For example, colonization of parts of Asia
and Africa by the Europeans. People from countries with low levels
of technological development are attracted towards places that are
technologically advanced. For example, migration of people from
less developed countries to more advanced countries like the US,
the UK, etc.

iii. Availability of economic resources: The cultivation of plantation
crops in tropical America resulted in the transportation of slaves
from Africa. Similarly, people from Europe migrated to the Prairies
of the USA to exploit the vast natural resources available there.

iv. Disturbance of the existing economic equilibrium: Rural India was
self- sufficient in the past, but had been drained and exploited dur-
ing the colonial rule. This led to the migration of large mass of rural
population. In Europe also, with the industrial development and the
introduction of new means of transport, the rural agrarian popula-
tion was forced to migrate to the newly discovered America. Similarly,
economic poverty, unemployment and lack of economic opportuni-
ties due to overpopulation force people to emigrate from their native
plaCes. For example, Punjabis migrate to Canada and South Indians
to the Gulf countries like Dubai, Kuwait, etc.

 v. Geographical factors: Generally, people migrate to places where they
can find better climate, natural resources or where they can carry on
their occupations. The fear of natural disasters such as earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, floods, famines are some of the geographical fac-
tors which make people migrate. They prefer to stay in a safe and a
suitable climate for their survival.

vi. Social causes: There are many social factors whiCh cause migra-
tion. People sometimes are forced to leave their places of origin
due to the social barriers which come in their way of development.
Unbearable social restrictions also lead to migration.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000140">140</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 140
</h1>
<p>

vii. Religious causes: Humans desire to live among people of their own
ethnic, social and religious groups. This is an important cause of
migration. For instance, the emigration of Balkans due to the Turkish
dominance during the twentieth century, the driving out of Jews
from Germany, Spain, Russia, etc. Many of the Kashmiri Pandits were
forced to emigrate from Jammu and Kashmir. Communities that are
conservative, however, are found to be less mobile.

viii. Political reasons: Political compulsions force people to migrate. This
was evident especially after World War II. Migration due to political rea-
sons can be seen in the case of Palestine, Pakistan, China, Hungary, etc.

ix. Wars: Wars have been a main cause for migration throughout his-
tory. World War I displaced about 6 million people and World War II,
about 60 million people.

x. Psychological factors: A need to migrate is not sufficient. There
are also repulsive and attractive psychological impressions that are
at work. Normally, there should exist something to attract the emi-
grants. This attraction may be a reality or a psychological impression.
The search for political or religious freedom accompanied sometimes
by the need for self- preservation, in the face of persecution has been
responsible for mass exodus, though it was quite contrary to the eco—
nomic interests of the migrants. For instance, the Jews who were in
a comfortable economic situation were forced to flee from the Nazi
Germany.

xi. Demographic factors: Age is an important factor affecting migration.
It is observed that the younger generation is more prone to migrate.
Similarly, male migration is dominant for economic reasons. Yet, for
social reasons and according to customs, married females need to
migrate to the place of their in— laws.

xii. Means of transport: Migration is closely related to the available
means of transport. It surged with the development of railways, which
facilitated the dissemination of knowledge, and enabled easy travel
between towns and countries. Today, the availability of airways has
also aided in international migration.

xiii. Transfers in job: Many classes of employees in both public and pri-
vate sectors of the economy are required to periodically change their
place of employment.

xiv. Diffusion of information: Increased awareness due to increased
access to information through education, cultural. contact, spatial
interaction and improved communication technology increases the
chances of population migration.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000141">141</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:141
</h1>
<p>
xv. Aspirations of the people: With greater comforts and luxuries available
in the market, people tend to have higher aspirations. Every individual.
seeks a better standard of living. This is the main cause for the rampant
‘brain drain’ by way of emigration of Indian professionals like doctors
and engineers to richer countries like the USA, the UK, etc.

xvi. Government policy: The government policy may be favourable or
adverse to migration. The population policies of most of the coun-
tries like the UK, Germany, France, etc. discourage immigrants. Some
countries offer incentives to encourage migration of population to the
less dense areas.
 </p>

<p>
PUSH AND PULL FACTORS

Certain factors push persons away from the area of origin. Such factors are
visible in the rural areas of underdeveloped countries. Push factors include
poverty, unemployment, lack of facilities, earthquake zones, cyclone- prone
areas, etc.
</p>

<p>
Push factors are events or features of the place in which people live that
push them away from that area.

. Farming is not invested in— without invest-ment, people who live in rural areas (who
mostly farm) cannot improve yields and so have little to eat or sell.

. Extreme physical conditions such as aridity, mOuntainS— these can make life difficult,
from simple things such as the daily Weather to growing crops.

. OVerpopulation— too many people and not enough resources.

. Mechanization causes a reduction in the number of jobs— this means
people are forced to look elsewhere for jobs.

. Pressure on the land.

. Natural disasters kill crops, people and livestock— the more that is
lost, the less people have.

. Starvation— this could be caused by famine, and so people are forced
to move to where there is a food supply.

. Overgrazing— this causes soil erosion and a loss of yields.

. Local communities forced to move— war, famine, etc. can force peo-
ple to go to safer places.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000142">142</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:142
</h1>
<p>
 . Lack of services (such as hospitals and schools) — people want to find
better education and health care for themselves and their families.

. Families do not own land— this means landowners can evict people
whenever they want.
 </p>

<p>
These factors pull people to the area of destinatiOn. These include employment
opportunities, educational and medical facilities, comfortable style of living, etc.
Pull factors are events or features that pull people towards another area.

. Looking for better paid jobs— urban areas are larger and have more and a larger
variety of paid work.

. Better chance of children going to schools urban areas have schools.

. Expect more comfortable housing— with services such as electricity and water
available, this should improve quality of life.

. Religious and political activities can be carried out more safely in cities.

. Have a higher quality of life.

. Attracted to the ‘bright lights’ of opportunity— urban areas are per-
ceived as having greater chances for so many different reasons.

. Better chance of access to services— a higher concentration of them
in urban areas, should increase chances of access, as there are little (if
any) in many rural areas.

. More reliable food sources— instead of relying on growing own crops,
buy it with wages instead.

There also exist push- back forces which cause the urban migrants to return
to their rural homes. For example, environmental pollution impacts, desire
for calm and stress- free life, etc.

</p>

<p>
MODELS OF MIGRATION

Models of migration are nothing but the causes and consequences of migra—
tion as advocated by various theorists. Each theorist has stressed on one or
the other factor or cause that result in migration, thus, developing various
models of migration. Some of them are discussed below:
</p>

<p>
Ravenstein’s Laws of Migration

  Ernest Ravenstein is known as the earliest migration theorist. Ravenstein, an
English geographer, used census data from England and Wales to develop
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000143">143</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 143
</h1>
<p>
his ‘Laws of Migration’ (1889). He states that migration was governed by a
‘push— pull’ process; that is, unfavourable conditions in One place (oppres-
sive laws, heavy taxation, etc.) ‘push’ people out, and favourable conditions
in an external location ‘pull’ them in. Ravenstein’s laws state that the pri-
mary cause for migration was better external economic Opportunities; the
volume of migration decreases as distance increases; migration occurs in
stages instead of one long move; population movements are bilateral; and
migration differentials (e.g., gender, social class, age) influence a person’s
mobility.
</p>


<p>
(Source: http://family.jrank.org/pages/1170/Migration-Theories-Migration.html)
</p>

<p>
In the late nineteenth century, E. G. Ravenstein formulated what is called the
‘Laws of migration’. According to this,

i. The majority of migrants go only a short distance;

ii. Migration proceeds step by step;

iii. Migrants going long distances generally go by preference to one of the
grand centres of commerce and industry;

iv. Each current of migration produces a compensating counter current;

v. The natives of town are less migrating than those of rural areas;

vi. Females are more migratory than males Within their country of birth,
but males more frequently venture beyond;

vii. Most migrants are adults— families rarely migrate out of their country
of birth;

viii. Large towns grow more by migration than by natural increase;

ix. Migration increases in volume With the development of industries
and commerce and improvement in transport facilities;

x. The major direction of migration is from the agricultural areas to the
industries and commerce; and

xi. The major causes of migration are economic.

These laws have been modified, though not fundamentally, by subsequent
research.
</p>

<p>
Neo-classical Model

According to O.S. Srivastava, the neo-classical economists propounded their
migration models with reference to the wages being equal to the marginal pro-
ductivity. They argued that if wage differentials exist, and if there is no hindrance
and if the people are ‘economic men’, people will migrate from places of
low wages to places of high wages till the wages at different places are more or
less equal and so is the marginal productivity of labour at all the places.

<p>
Everett Lee’s Model of Migration

Everett Lee has given the various factors that are associated with regard to
the process of migration. These factors are categorized into follows:

i. Factors associated with the area of origin and  destination:
A combination of various factors affect in driving away people from
a specific area, or to hold on to an area or also to attract to an area.
There are significant differences in the factors that are associated
with the place of origin and destination. A balanced analysis is made
before migration takes place. It is usually a known fact that people
have more knowledge about their places of origin than the places of
their destination.

ii. Intervening obstacles: Distance and  transportation are gener—
ally considered intervening obstacles in the process of migration.
However, these obstacles are no longer considered obstacles with the
development of technology.

iii. Personal factors: These factors are of utmost importance because,
instead of the actual factors associated with the place of origin and/
or destination, the individual’s perception of these factors is found to
influence on the actual act of migration. Individual differences, too,
play their part, as some people are generally resistant to changes of
any kind, especially to a change of residence, while others are eager
for such a change.
 </p>

 <p>
Therefore, Lee opined that the decision to migrate is never completely ratio-
nal, and hence it follows that it is always possible to come across exceptions
of any type of generalization about migration.
 </p>

 <p>
Lee also gives an account of the characteristics of the migrants, the vol-
ume of migration and also about the streams and counterstreams of migra-
tion. According to O. S. Srivastava, Lee is of the opinion that migrants are
the persons who are ambitious or who cannot get any job at the place of
their original residence or cannot get jobs there to suit their skills, knowl-
edge, or aspirations; or, who do not find the total environment agreeable,
for example, the socio-cultural conditions, the climate, etc. In Lee’s model,
the volume of migration depends on the diversity of people and places. The
volume of migration will naturally be high if obstacles are less. Migration
develops through definite streams. Each stream of migration becomes a
counterstream of an earlier migration.
 </p>

 <p>
Lewis’s Model of Migration

Lewis is of the opinion that migration from rural to urban areas must be
encouraged as there exists large scale of disguised underemployment and
 </p>

<p>
 unemployment in the rural areas. Generally, in rural areas, all the family
members are involved in the agricultural production, be it small or large
farms. A family wOrking in small farms can be withdrawn as it does not
affect the productivity of the land. This means that these people were not
necessary in such agricultural production and was having zero marginal
productivity. If such people were transferred to works or places that resulted
in positive marginal physical productivity, it would contribute to the devel-
opment of the rural and urban economies, agricultural and industrial sectors
and to the nation as a whole. The government should take up several public
work programmes to divert these people to such works. This will be an effective
way for achieving development and which is not non- inflationary. It
will raise not only the productivity and employment opportunities, but also
the income of these persons. The government should ensure that there is an
orderly transfer of surplus manpower from the rural/ agricultural sector to
the urban/ manufacturing sector.
</p>

<p>
TYPES OF MIGRATION

Economists, sociologists, statiSticians and geographers have made many
attempts to classify the different types of migration:
 	In -migration occurs due to pull factors like industry, employment
opportunities, etc. It accelerates the economic prosperity of an individual
or a group.
	Out-migration occurs due to push factors or unfavourable conditions
of an area. This would lead to depressed economic condition in the area.

 Migration can be further classified into internal and international migration.
</p>

<p>
Internal Migration

	Internal migration basically refers to migration that takes place within a
country’s national boundaries. Internal migration includes rural— urban,
rural— rural, urban— rural and intra- urban migration.
</p>

<p>
Rural- Urban

   Migrations from rural to urban areas are generally the most common form
of internal migration especially in countries experiencing industrialization
and rapid technology change. Economic development and rise in per capita
income have led to a large bulk of internal migration from villages towards
towns and suburbs.

	Rural— urban migration is mainly for economic motives. In areas of
departure population pressure, modernization of agriculture and traditional

system of land tenure have been some of the key push factors. Rapid increase
of employment opportunities is a major pull factor in urban areas. The
development of railways has contributed to the unprecedented rural— urban
migration. The improved transport facilities have enabled greater cultural
diffusion and increased awareness. Cultural contrasts still inhibit internal
migration in some countries like India.
 </p>

 <p>
Thus, rural— urban migrants are mostly the economically backward population
in underdeveloped countries; but in advanced countries, such movement
has led to connecting the labour surplus and unemployment in rural
areas. Such rural migrants may be either changing their line of occupation
from agriculture to a non-agricultural one or may be in searCh of their first
employment. The main employment attractions are factories, shops, offices,
construction and public services. Towns also offer amenities like schools,
shops, entertainments, public utilities, etc.
 </p>

<p>
The inconveniences in urban areas are high costs of living, housing and
transport, noise, atmospheric pollution, etc. Slums and shantytowns develop
due to unplanned and unbalanced rural— urban migration.
 </p>

<p>
In few countries, small towns act as intermediate stations for the flow of
rural— urban migrants. This kind of stepped migration is not a common fea-
ture though. The drift of population away from core of the city core towards
the outskirts is due to the growing land values and the improvements in
transportation.
 </p>

<p>
Rural- Rural

Failure of crops, lack of opportunities for remunerative work, better medi—
cal facilities, escape from social persecution / ostracization and marriage are
some of the factors which lead people to migrate from one rural area to
another.
 </p>

<p>
Urban- Rural

  	As we know, economic gain is one of the main factors for migration, but
since urban areas are more economically developed than rural areas with
better facilities and Opportunities urban- to rural migration does not take
place commonly. Such migration takes place due to the puSh— back forces
of the urban areas. These forces include the stress filled and busy life of the
cities, high crime rates, lack of fresh air and open space, moral decay, envi—
ronmental pollution, etc. Thus, people who prefer a calm and quiet lifestyle
may migrate to rural areas. Such a migration generally does not lead to eco—
nomic development. In developing countries, workers employed in the city
also reside in sub—urban and surrounding rural areas, and need to shuttle up
and down everyday.

<p>
Inter-regional or  Intra -urban/ Urban Migration

	Most recent inter-regional migrations have been from rural and urban areas
of one region to urban areas of another. People migrate from the less favoured
parts of the country to the more favoured parts. Inter—regional migration is
associated with metropolitan development. People from the surrounding
towns and smaller urban centres are attracted to the ‘big- city’, its lifestyle
and the sea of opportunities it offers. The growth in Mumbai’s population
and the cities of New York, Chicago and others in the northeastern parts of
the United States IS due to such preferential migration.
 </p>

<p>
   Apart from the preceding description about various types of internal
migration, Table 6.1 explains the typology, destination and the reasons for
such migration. Here, you can also observe some other reasons for these
various types of migration apart from the preceding discussion.
 </p>

<p>
International Migration

 	International migration means the movement of people from one country
to another. It consists of two main processes— immigration and emigration.
These terms are used to refer to the movement of people into or outside a
particular country or territory.
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000148">148</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:148
</h1>
<p>
 	People who migrate are called migrants. People leaving a country are
called emigrants and those arriving in a country are called immigrants.
 </p>

<p>
 	In the mid-1990s, about 145 million people lived outside their native
countries, and each year, the number is increasing by anywhere from 2 million
to 4 million. In the mid-1990s, the largest immigration flows were from
Latin America and Asia into North America, and from Eastern Europe, the
countries of the former Soviet Union and North Africa into Northern and
Western Europe. The Middle East draws migrants from Africa and Asia and
hosts millions of refugees from within the region. There is a considerable
migration within Asia, Africa and Latin America.
 </p>

<p>
  	International migration also depends on the political situations of the
country than individual or personal choices. In 1947, the partition of India
led to the migration and influx of millions of people into India, which caused
changes in the spatial, demographic and economic aspects of both the borders
of India and Pakistan. It can lead to the evolution and functioning of
Western capitalism. The establishment of various colonies around the world
by the Europeans was due to the international migration. Urban areas seem
to be the most secure choice for immigrants in developing their careers and
achieving their goals in life. Thus, the recent trend is that the educated youth
of the less developed countries are migrating to the cities of the developed
countries either for jobs or for pursuing higher education.
 </p>

<p>
IMPACT OF MIGRATION

The effects of migrations are not merely a reallocation of human resources,
but studying its effects on space and man are also essential. Thus, we analyse
the effect of migration on the area experiencing in-migration, the area
experiencing out-migration and the migrants themselves. Migration is also
considered a sensitive index of changing patterns of economic opportunities
and the cultural landscape.
 </p>

<p>
Spatial Impact

These consequences are the most relevant to geographers. The reception areas
absorb people hungrily, the countryside fills up and new lands are opened
up. There are changes in the distribution and density of the population.
 </p>

  <p>
Some areas experience a diminishing population, with towns decaying,
countryside emptying and their fields lying waste.
 </p>

<p>
For instance, the rising urbanization during the past century upset the
population distribution of many countries. The towns are being inflated
while the rural areas are being depopulated. Urban sprawl is a phenomenon
that can be commonly observed when migration into the city is high.

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000149">149</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
 Impact on Population

 	Migration affects the statistics and the character of the population at the
source and destinatiOn areas. Belief systems, education, habits as well as
tradition and Culture are modified. People tend to be more scientific and
logical in their thinking when they migrate to advanced societies. Their
belief in God as the Supreme power is reduced. Sex ratio is disturbed and
age pyramid may assume strange shapes. Migration leads to increased levels
of education in the society. Men are more prone to migration than women,
therefore the departure zones become depopulated of their men folk mainly
the young men, and the reception areas experience a lack of women. This has
been observed even in the early stages of long distance migration. This distortion
has led to mixed marriages leading to the evolution of a new strange
culture. Such a change in demography has been observed in the migration
of Indians to South Africa, and the Chinese to South-east Asia. Even within
a country, such demographic distortions are observed between the rural and
urban centres.
 </p>

 <p>
 	In the less developed countries of Africa, it has been observed that the
males leave their women in the village for good, while the scarcity of females
in the towns encourages immorality and bad habits. In advanced countries
like the USA, the situation is different, both men and women leave the rural
areas leaving the elderly population. Thus, there is no distortion in the sex
composition, but a change in the age structure is observed.
 </p>

 <p>
Any change in the migration pattern leads to fluctuations in the popula-
tion structure. Rapid urban growth leads to increased adult population with
males dominating at first, but later, equilibrium is reached when the adult
women produce children.
 </p>
<p>
 Let us now look at the impacts of migration on the home country and
 receiving country with their advantages and disadvantages.
 </p>

 <p>
Advantages and Disadvantages— Home Country

The advantages and disadvantages on home country due to migration are as
follows:

. Advantages

	.   Increased productivity and efficiency of the experienced workers
   	who have returned.

	.  Unskilled migrants become semi-skilled with training and
   	experience.

	. Transfer of saving leads to progress.

	. Socio-economic development due to the influence of way of life of
  	returned migrants.

  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000150">150</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:150
</h1>
<p>
. Disadvantages

. Emigration of young population disturbs the eConomy.

. Emigration of educated and healthy population affects economic
development.

. Migrants may settle down permanently in the foreign country.
</p>

<p>
Advantages and Disadvantages- Receiving Country

The advantages and disadvantages to the receiving country due to migration
are as follows:

. Advantages
     	. Immigrants provide skilled labour for economic growth.

     	. Continued growth and production due to working immigrants.

     	. When foreign workers leave the country they become self-reliant.
       	in the long-run.

. Disadvantages

    	. Initial setback for the country when foreign workers leave the
      	country.

   	. Overpopulation leading to housing, pressure on services, pollution, etc.
  </p>

<p>
Social Consequences

	Migration leads to acculturation and enculturation. It also brings about
changes in the values, ideas, beliefs, and attitudes of the migrant population.
It also helps in decreasing the gap between the various cultures, which can
result in culture contact.
  </p>

<p>
Migrants suffer from various kinds of deprivations in the destination
areas. Food, housing would be of major problems, which has led to the
develOpment of slums. These slums with no inadequate facilities, such as
water, drainage, would lead to unhygienic conditions. Such unhygienic conditions
make these migrants more vulnerable to dreadful diseases. Migrants
who work as labourers also suffer from occupational health hazards due to
their working conditions. The children of these migrants often do not receive
schooling or education due to their poor economic conditions.
</p>

<p>
Biological Consequences

	The transplanted individuals find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings
with new customs and contacts. These changes cause a loss of rural identity;
there is large— scale blending of all kinds of people, and no distinction

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000151">151</pagenum>

<p>
 is maintained. Migrants from rural centres suffer from lack of fresh air and
open space and changes in diet as well. It is observed that migrants to large
industrial cities have a higher incidence of diseases as compared to the
natives who are acclimatized to the city environment.
</p>

<p>
Economic Consequences

 The area of origin of the migrants loses its active, enterprising young population.
This young population exploits all the facilities necessary for growth
and education available in the area. The brighter side of this phenomenon
is that not all the young leave the area and so facilitate better reorganization
of the community, with lower unemployment and with a higher standard of
living. The United States of America has benefited from immigration during
various stages of its history. Initially, it was the early immigrants from
England and France who introduced the plantation farming successfully in
the USA, then during the twentieth century, it was the migration of skilled
labour from Europe that brought with them the technical know—how and
introduced large- scale industrialization by making use of the available vast
reserves of natural resources in the area. In the recent times again, we see the
immigration of the best human resources from different parts of the world
especially from India serving in the information technology industry.
</p>

<p>
 	Migration into an area leads to improvements in other sectors of economy
of that area. Transport and communication facilities are the most influenced,
which in turn affect all other economic activities.
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY

. One of the major components apart from mortality and fertility,
which affect the population change, is ‘migration’. Migration together
with fertility and mortality is a fundamental element determining
population growth and population structure in an area.

. Migration is generally a deliberate movement made by the human
beings. Thus, migration is the result of the social, economic, political
and cultural circumstances to which the human beings are exposed
in their societies.

. Another important aspect of migration is its influence on the size
of the population. Migration can change the population size very
drastically.

. Migration is also Considered an instrument of cultural diffusion and
social integration resulting in a more meaningful pattern of distribution
of population.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000152">152</pagenum>

<p>
. Poverty, availability of economic resources and employment opportunities
in urban areas, technology, social, political, psychological,
demographic, transfers in jobs and aspirations of people are some of
the important factors which affect the process of migration. Apart
from these, there are many push and pull factors that cause migration.

. Models of migration are nothing but the causes and consequences
of migration as advocated by various theorists. Each theorist has
stressed on one or the other factor/ causes that cause migration. Some
of them are Ravenstein’s law of migration, Everett Lee’s model and
Lewis’s model of migration.

. Migration can be classified into internal and international migration.
Internal migration basically refers to migratiOn that takes place
within a country’s national boundaries.

. The process of urbanization refers to the increase in the size and density
of population in cities because of the migration or movement of
the population from the rural areas.

. The effects of migrations are not merely a reallocation of human
resources, but studying its effects on space and man are also essential.
Migration leads to many demographic, social, economic and biological
consequences.

INTRODUCTION

Population of a country refers to the number of people living in that country
at a particular point of time. The number of people is actually counted after
every 10 years. This process of counting is called the census of population.
In India, the last census was conduCted in 2001 and prior to that in 1991. For
example, the 1991 census gave India’s population as 84.63 crore. It means
that at the sunrise of 1 March 1991, India’s population was 84.63 crore. The
census of population provides infOrmation not only about the size of population,
but also about its various features such as sex composition, age composition,
growth rate, level of literacy, density, etc. The rate of national growth
is expressed as a percentage for each country, commonly between about
0.1 per cent and 3 per cent annually. We can find two elements associated
with population —natural growth and overall growth. Natural growth represents
the births and deaths in a country’s population and does not take into
account migration. The overall growth rate takes migration into account.
Increased population growth generally represents problems for a country— it
means growing need for food, infrastructure and services. These are
expenses that most developed countries have little ability to provide today,
let alone if population rises dramatically.

<p>
GROWTH OF INDIA’S POPULATION

India is the world’s second most populous nation. In recent times, the
growth in Indian population has witnessed a downscale. This present trend
of slowdown in the population growth is expected to continue as people
realize the benefits of raising smaller families. Many eminent demographers
have stated that in the next few years, the growth rate of the population will
decline faster than anticipated. Experts opine that the change is linked to
higher media exposure of the advantages of smaller families. The concept
of more-children-means—more—hands-to-earn (once) ruled the roost in a
country where almost 30 per cent of the people live in abject poverty. The
statistics show that the population grew to 936 million in 1996/97 (April— March)
from 920 million a year earlier. In the previous years, the figure (of
annual growth) used to waver between 18 and 19 million.
</p>

<p>
India’s high population growth results in increasingly impoverished
and sub-standard conditions for growing segments of the Indian
population. As of 2007, India ranked 126th on the United Nations’ Human
Development Index, which takes into account social, health, and educational
conditions in a country. Population projections for India anticipate
that the country’s population will reach 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion by 2050.
While only the Population Reference Bureau has published projections
out to 2100, they expect India’s population at the close of the twenty- first
century to reach 1.853 billion to 2.181 billion. Thus, India is expected to
become the first and only county on the planet that will ever reach a population
of more than 2 billion (recall that China’s population is likely to drop
after reaching a peak of about 1.46 billion in 2030 and the USA isn’t likely
to see a billion).
</p>

population.htm)
</p>

<p>
Family planning officials opine that the government has taken some
measures to encourage smaller families, which include literacy campaigns,
particularly among women, and making many voluntary organizations
to educate rural Indians on the benefits of having rewer children.
Organizations often use folklore and music to help increase awareness
about family planning. India’s current population of 936 million is second
only to China’s 1.2 billion. The rate of population growth, 2.1 per cent per
annum in the 1980s, fell to 1.8 per cent during 1990—94, according to the
World Bank report.
</p>

<p>
 It is projected that India will have a larger population than China by the
year 2045, when the United Nations projections indicate a total population
of India of 1.501 billion and of China of 1.496 billion. India, with an annual
population growth rate of 1.65 per cent, is the largest contributOr to world
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000155">155</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
Rural Population

  Predominantly, rural population in India is estimated to be approximately 70
per cent. In such areas, children are considered to be an asset rather than a
liability. This idea emanates from the belief that in agricultural —based economies,
more helping hands are required and every additional child would
mean many more people to help in carrying out the agricultural-based activities.
In rural areas, children are needed as labourers on farms. In urban areas,
they are needed to work in the informal sector to earn money for their families.
This is why, rural birth rates in India are higher than in the urban areas.
 </p>

 <p>
Slow Pace of Urbanization

Owing to the slow pace of urbanization, the socio-economic factOrs associated
with urbanization such as high literacy, more employment, higher status
for women, higher standard and cost of living, and so on are limited.
Socio-economic characteristics associated with rural settlements such as low
literacy, dependence on agriculture, influence of religion and adherence to
traditional social customs and beliefs are predominant. This has contributed
largely to the high growth rate of population in the country.
 </p>

 <p>
High Level of Illiteracy

India has a literacy rate of approximately 60 per cent. Female literacy rate
is still lower. Differentials can be seen even in rural urban areas while rural
ones are seen to be much lower. Illiteracy and lack of awareness of availability
and use of family planning methods has resulted in a high growth rate of
populatiOn in rural areas.
 </p>

 <p>
Religious Beliefs

Religious beliefs reinforce the doctrine that children are a gift of God and
human beings have no right to interfere in the natural process of birth.
Culture or religions sometimes make it unacceptable to use contraception.
This belief in turn again restricts the use of birth control measures.
 </p>

 <p>
Desire for a Male Child

In most religions, there is a belief that a male child is a means for attaining
salvation. In addition to this, a male child is also required to carry forward
the family name. There is also a belief that a son will look after his parents
in their old age. Hence, couples desire to have a male offspring. Women also
have a large number of children due to high level of infant mortality.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000156">156</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:156
</h1>
<p>
Minimal Use of Birth Control Measures

Population in rural areas generally make minimum use of family planning
methods because of religious beliefs, social customs, illiteracy and lack of
awareness of use of family planning methods adopt the minimal use of contraceptives.
Lack of family planning education automatically results in the
high growth of population in such areas.
 </p>

 <p>
Low Status of Women

Since there is basically a patriarchal society in India with a few exceptions
such as Kerala, women are not given the choice of planning or spacing their
children. It is the men who decide these matters in a large number of households.
Low female literacy rates, low female employment opportunities and
patriarchal societies result in women being relegated to the background.
 </p>

 <p>
Low Age at Marriage

Another factor responsible for the high growth of population in India is
the span of fertility. Since the age at marriage in India is low, the fertility or
reproductive period of adults is long, and the chances of having mOre number
of children is high. Indian laws say that men cannot marry before 21 and
women before 18 years.
</p>

<p>
POPULATION CHANGES IN INDIA

The population of less economically developed countries are growing very
rapidly. Most are at stage 2 and 3 of the demographic transition model. They
have declining death rates and high birth rates. Therefore, natural increase
is high. Death rates are declining because of improvements in sanitation
and health care. Birth rates are high for a number of reasons as mentioned
earlier.
 </p>

<p>
India’s population is estimated to be around 1 billion. It has one of
the highest population growth rates in the world. In the last 10 years, its
population has increased by 181 million. If this growth rate continues, it
could become the world’s most populated country by 2020. However, India’s
population growth rate is slowing down. This is particularly the case in the
southern state of Kerala. In Kerala, a number of initiatives have been taken
to reduce population growth. More women are being educated in the state
while in the rest of the country, around half of all women cannot read or
write. However, in Kerala 85 per cent of women are literate. Better— educated
women are more likely to keep their children healthy. Therefore, infant mortality
has dropped. This has led to a drop in birth rates, because if all children
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000157">157</pagenum>

Page no: 157
</h1>
<p>
who are born survive, families no longer get through to have a couple of extra
children to replace those who die. Also, contraception is more widely available
and the status of women has improved significantly. They are no longer
seen as a burden— they are regarded as an asset. Traditionally in India, when
a woman gets married, the family has to pay money to the bridegroom’s family.
This is called dowry. However, in Kerala it is the bridegroom’s family who
pays dowry to the bride’s family.
</p>

<p>
According to the provisional results compiled for the Census of India
2001, the population of India at 0:00 hours of 1 March 2001, stood at
1,027,015,247 comprising 531,277,078 males and 495,738,169 females. Thus,
as widely believed and expected, India became only the second country in
the world after China to officially cross the one billion mark. It is certainly
most unlikely that in the history of mankind any country other than India
and China would be shaping the lives and future of over a billion people.

<p>
The above statement presents the population of India as recorded in
each decadal census since 1901. Some other indicators of growth rate such
as decadal growth rate, change in decadal growth, average annual exponential
growth rate and progressive growth rate over 1901 during each decade
have also been presented in this statement. Thus, the population of India,
which at the turn of the twentieth century, was only around 238.4 million
increased by more than four times in a period of hundred years to reach
1027 million at the dawn of the twenty- first century. Interestingly, the population
of India grew by one and half times in the first half of the twentieth
century, while in the later half it recorded almost a phenomenal threefold
increase.
</p>

<p>
There was decadal growth of population in India during 1901—2001.
India’s population growth during the twentieth century can be charted and
classified into four distinct phases as follows:

i. 1901—21: Stagnant population.
ii. 1921—51: Steady growth.
iii. 1951—81: Rapid high growth.
iv. 1981—01: High growth with definite signs of slowing down.
</p>

<p>
The story of population growth in India is in tune with the classical theory
of demographic transition. During the nineteenth century, India witnessed
a fluctuating and stagnant growth of population, which drifted into the
twentieth century until 1921. Thereafter, the country passed through all
the phases of demographic transition and is now Widely believed to have
entered the fifth phase, usually characterized by rapidly declining fertility.
The crucial question is, how long will this phase extend and when will
India achieve a stable population? The National Population Policy (NPP),
2000, adopted by the Government of India states that ‘the long-term objective
is to achieve a stable population by 2045, at a level consistent with the
requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and
environment protection’. It has been assumed in the policy document that
the medium- term objective of bringing down the total fertility rate (TFR)
to replacement level of 2.1 by 2010 will be achieved. It was envisaged that
if the NPP was fully implemented, the population of India had to be 1013
million by 2002 and 1107 million by 2010. However, in 2001 itself, India
had already exceeded the estimated population for the year 2002 by about
14 million. It will no doubt require a Herculean effort on the part of the
government and the people to achieve the much- cherished goal of a stable
population.

<p>
   In absolute terms, the population of India increased by a whopping
180.6 million during the decade of 1991—2001. The absolute addition to the
population during the decade 1991—2001 is more than the estimated population
of Brazil, the fifth most populous country in the world. Although,
the net addition in population during each decade increased consistently,
the change in net addition shows a steady declining trend over the decades
starting from 1961. While 27.9 million more people were added between
the decade 1981— 91 and 1971— 81, this number declined to 17.6 million for
the decades between 1981— 91 and 1991— 01. This implies that as a result of
the combination of population momentum and somewhat delayed fertility,
although India cOntinues to grow in size, its pace of net addition is on the
decrease. The percentage decadal growth during 1991—2001 has registered
the sharpest decline since independence. Almost half of the country’s population
lives in five states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal
and Andhra Pradesh.
</p>

<p>
The percentage decadal growth declined during the census decade
1991— 2001 as compared to the previous census decade in all the
states/ union territories except Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim,
Nagaland, Manipur, Gujarat, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.
These states and union territories that have shown increases in
percent decadal growth together constitute about 32 percent of India’s
population.
</p>

<p>
During the inter-censal period 1991—2001, a decline of more than five
percentage points in decadal growth rate from the previous census decade
was recorded for the states of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Arunachal
Pradesh, Delhi, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh,
and also for the union territories of Lakshadweep, Pondicherry and Andaman
and Nicobar Islands. These twelve states and union territories together
account for 22.61 per cent of the country’s population. In fact, among the
major states, Andhra Pradesh registered the sharpest drop of 10.33 percentage
points during the said period followed by Chhattisgarh (7.67) and West
Bengal (6.89). Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Meghalaya,
Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu
and the union territory of Chandigarh have shoWn a decline of one to
five percentage points in their growth rates during 1991—2001 as compared
to 1981— 1991. These twelve states and union territories together account for
37.54 per cent of total population. In Rajasthan and Jharkhand, the decline
in percentage decadal growth is less than one percentage point. These two
states account for 8.12 per cent of India’s population. Thus, almost two— third
of the Indian population lives in states and union territories, which show a

CONSEQUENCES OF POPULATION GROWTH IN INDIA

Environmental Pollution

Environmental pollution is one of the serious problems faced by the people
in India. Rapid population growth, industrialization and urbanization
are adversely affecting the environment in the country. Although the relationship
is complex, population size and growth tend to expand and accelerate
these human impacts on the environment.  All these in turn lead to
an increase in the pollution levels. However, environmental pollution not
only leads to deteriorating environmental conditions but also has adverse
effects on the health of the people. India is one of the most badly affected
countries where environment is concerned. It is paying a heavy price for
it. Population growth and increasing urbanization is directly linked to the
environment and health of the people. Rapid population growth plays an

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000161">161</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:161
</h1>
<p>
important role in environmental problems of the country, from deforestation
to land degradation, air and water pollution to the spread of disease. The
considerable magnitude of air and water pollution increases the number of
people suffering from respiratory and water—borne diseases and often leads
to deaths and serious health hazards. There is an urgent need to control population
and environmental pollution in the country, for better health of the
present and future generations.
</p>

<p>
Growth of Per Capita Income

Demographers often ask whether there exists a long- run relationship
between growth rates of population and per capita income in India. They
seek to discover the direction of causality between the above- mentioned
variables. To discover the relationship and direction of causality, studies
employ different kinds of tests. Findings show that there exists a long- run
relationship between growth rate of population and per capita income, and
there is an unidirectional causality from growth of population to growth of
per capita income in India.
</p>

<p>
Poverty

Everywhere in the world, in every kind of culture, the poorest people have
the most children. Those who think that poverty causes population growth
favour direct economic aid, jobs and capital investment. ‘Take care of development,’
they say, ‘and the birth rate will take care of itself’. Poverty does
cause population growth and population growth does cause poverty. It
becomes difficult when population increases. It means increaSing control of
both parts of the cycle, the ability to choose your family size, and the ability
to make a living with something more than your hands and the hands of
your children.
</p>

<p>
Population Pressure

High density of population refers to a situation where there are more
number of people per square area. Population growth and land shortage,
fragmentation and degradation have been identified as key problems
in the development and conservation of areas affected by this problem.
Studies related to population pressure examine through a demographic
survey and questions, issues connected to the use of and attitudes towards
family planning. Problems concerning land are examined through a survey
of current land uses and the use of and attitudes towards a range of
sustainable agricultural techniques. In the past decade, approaches to
resource conservation and management have evolved towards a greater
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000162">162</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:162
</h1>
<p>
	consideration of local community needs and opinions. If conservation is
going to succeed in the long term, it must involve local people directly
and actively in all stages of the management and decision- making process.
Pressure on land leads to problems such as housing, food and basic
amenities of the population living in a particular area. It also leads to over-
crowding that results in the depletion of the resources. Overpopulation is
one of the main hindrances to economic and social development. It also
leads to unemployment as more number of people are found to compete
for limited job opportunities.
</p>

<p>
increase of Manpower Resources

 Growth in population also has some positive effects. An increase in the
availability of manpower resources leads to more working hands and skilled
labour. There is no dearth of labour in any sector and this in turn leads to the
development of industry in any nation that has high growth of population.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, it can be said that populations grow according to the
number of individuals who are capable of reproduction. At the same
time, their growth is limited according to scarcity of land or food, or the
presence of external forces such as predators. It is true that among the
several classes in the society, those having the greatest economic self-
sufficiency show, in general, the lowest birth rate. In modern times, the
fall in birth rates is more a result of attitude and awareness rather than
aspects such as fertility. Fertility in human kind does not change in a
short period of time. Low birth rates among the urban dwellers are the
result of a mental attitude plus the knowledge necessary to make that
attitude effective. Efforts are being made for the implementation of the
same model also to the rural folk. Once this is achieved, a sustainable
development can take place.
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY

. Population of a country refers to the number of people living in that
country at a particular point of time. To arrive at a reasonable estimate
of how the world’s population will grow in the next 50 years,
one has to look at birth and death rates. On the whole, the rate of the
world’s population growth is slowing down. Throughout the 1960s,
the world’s population was growing at a rate of about 2 per cent per
year. By 1990, that rate was down to 1.5 per cent, and by the year 2015,
it is expected to drop to 1 per cent. Family planning initiatives, an
ageing population and the effects of diseases such as AIDS are some
of the factors behind this rate decrease.

	. In India, the last census was conducted in 2001 and prior to that in
1991. For example, the 1991 census gives India’s population as 84.63
crore. It means that at the sunrise of 1 March 1991, India’s population
was 84.63 crore. The census of population provides information not
only about the size of population, but also about its various features
such as sex composition, age composition, growth rate, level of literacy,
density, etc.

. India is the world’s second most populous nation. In recent times,
the growth in Indian population has witnessed a downscale. This
present trend of slowdown in the population growth is expected to
continue as people realize the benefits of raising smaller families.
Many eminent demographers have stated that in the next few years,
the growth rate of the population will decline faster than anticipated.
Experts opine that the change is linked to higher media
exposure of the advantages of smaller families. The concept of
more—children-means-more—hands-to-earn (once) ruled the roost
in a country where almost 30 per cent of the people live in abject
poverty.

. The government has taken some measures to encourage smaller families,
which include literacy campaigns, particularly among women,
and making many voluntary organizations, educate rural Indians on
the benefits of having fewer children.

. India conducts a census every 10 years. The population was 548
million in 1971, 683 million in 1981, 846 million in 1991 and it has
crossed the 1 billion mark in 2001. A wider media exposure generated
by India’s economic reforms launched in 1991 is helping to slow
population growth. The aspirations of people to lead a better life after
being exposed to an accessible electronic media are making them
realize the virtues of a small family.

. Rapid population growth, industrialization and urbanization are
adversely affecting the environment in the country. There exists a
long- run relationship between growth rate of population and per
capita income. Everywhere in the world, in every kind of culture,
the poorest people have the most children. Those who think that
poverty causes population growth favour direct economic aid, jobs
and capital investment. Poverty does cause population growth and
population growth does cause poverty. High density of population
refers to a situation where there are more number of people per

INTRODUCTION

 Population distribution refers to the pattern of where people live; the location
of people within an area. The population of the world is unevenly distributed
for a number of reasons. There are reasons which attract people
which may include mineral resources, temperate climate, the availability
of water and fertile land. There are also factors which repel people, these
include dense vegetation, swamps, mountainous areas, limited accessibility
and political or religious oppression.

<p>
The composition of population is one of the interesting and significant
aspects of social demography. The study of population composition provides
information about different kinds of people found in any given population
and the differences that exist among the different groups. This chapter mainly
covers the composition of population through biological attributes, such as

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000166">166</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 166
</h1>
<p>
sex and age; also rural— urban distribution of population, occupational composition,
and religions in India; literacy and birth rates in India. In social
demography, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the basic personal,
social and economic characteristics or attributes of any population.
 </p>

 <p>
CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULATION COMPOSITION

A population is spread into subgroups, according to certain characteristics.
For instance: when sex is considered, the entire population is classiﬁed
into two groups: males and females. If religion is considered, the entire
population is divided into different religious groups. The study of population
composition and characteristics, thus, relates to the distribution of one or
more of these characteristics or attributes within a population. This type of

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000167">167</pagenum>
<h1>
page no:167
</h1>
<p>
analysis promotes an understanding of the issues related to a given population.
These include the proportion of males and females in a given population,
the distribution pattern of population such as children, young adults,
and elderly persons and percentage of literate and illiterate population. It
also aims at finding out and measuring changes and its characteristics over
a period of time.
 </p>

<p>
The characteristics or attributes that are incorporated in the study of the
composition of the population are classified into two groups: (i) ascribed
characteristics and (ii) achieved characteristics.
 </p>

<p>
Ascribed Characteristics

Ascribed characteristics are biological or culturally assigned. These are
properties of an individual and the individual has very little control over
them. These characteristics broadly cover race, ethnicity, gender, caste,
height and religion. The ascribed characteristics are more or less equally
caused by ‘nature’, i.e., genetics and by ‘nurture’, i.e., parenting during early
childhood. The term is often used with reference to show how people with
a certain ascribed characteristics are systematically treated differently than
other members of the society which is perceived as unfair. Thus, the study
of casteism refers to the study of the ways that people of a certain caste and
cultural background are systematically ill— treated by the society at large.
There are debates over whether or not a given trait is ‘really’ an ascribed
characteristic even though, anyone born with particular characteristics
pertaining to nationality, religion and caste may be later changed eXercising
one’s individual’s choice. In this sense, it may be considered ascribed
characteristic.
 </p>

<p>
Achieved Characteristics

Achieved characteristics reflect the social status, prestige and the ability
of an individual to acquire an established position in the society
as a result of individual accomplishments. These are normally open
to the individual’s choice. The marital status, educational attainment,
labour force status, occupations, industry and others are the achieVed
characteristics.
 </p>


 <p>
Sources of Data for the Study of Population Composition

Information about population characteristics and composition are primarily
obtained from the national census. The demographic surveys also offer data.
The population censuses are the main source of information beginning from
the inception of the Census of India in 1871 to the present.

<p>
  In this chapter, the population composition of India in terms of sex ratio,
age structure, urban— rural population, occupational composition, religions,
literacy and birth rate in India are discussed.
</p>


 <p>

Relation Between Sex and Age Structure
of Indian Population

Sex and age are the basic characteristics, or the biological attributes, of any
demographic group. These influence not only the demographic structure,
but also social, economic and political structure of any country. Biological
characteristics influence birth and death rates, internal and international
migration, marital status composition, manpower, the gross national product,
planning regarding educational and medical services, and housing.
These kinds of information or statistics are necessary for the promotional
campaigns to carry out in different parts of the country, as these determine
the needs of the clients in quantitative terms. The attitude of society towards
children, the youth and elderly people is affected by the sex— age distribution
of the population.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, population data are classified based upon sex and age. The
data on fertility, mortality, migration, marital status and economic characteristics
are initially presented separately for males and females; later they are
cross- classified according to age. Sex and age are significant for the reason
that these are the visible, indisputable and convenient indicators of social status.
Each individual is attributed a certain status in the society on the basis of
sex and age. Similarly, an individual’s expected role in the family and society
is associated with sex and age. These are culturally determined and vary from
one culture to another. Even within the same culture, these are transformed
over a period of time. In the traditional Hindu family, status is accorded on
the basis of sex and age. For instance, men are considered more significant
than women, and the elderly are considered more important than younger
people. Women’s roles are well defined and described from birth onwards
and are mostly confined to the kitchen. But, this situation has changed in the
urban areas, due to the employment of women. In oriental societies, elders
are considered storehouses of experience and wisdom, and consequently as
advisers and consultants. In the Western society, the ‘youth cult’ and a ‘youth-
oriented culture’ are prevailing in which the aged have no place. The roles and
the status of the individuals shape the demographic condition.
</p>


<p>
SEX RATIO

Sex is an easily identifiable characteristic and its dichotomous nature
presents some problems for classification. In order to examine the sex
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000169">169</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 169
</h1>
<p>
composition of any population, two procedures are adopted by and large.
They are (i) the percentage of males in the population or masculinity proportion
and (ii) the sex ratio. Of these two procedures, the latter is more
frequently used in the study of population.
</p>

<p>
The sex ratio of a population is expressed as the number of males per
1000 females or as the number of females per 1000 males. The sex structure
is based on the former definition of sex ratio and is followed the world over,
though the Indian Census has preferred to follow the latter definition. When
the sex ratio is said to be defined as the number of males per 1000 females,
the sex ratio above 100 indicates a high sex ratio, while that below 100 is Considered
to be a low sex ratio. The sex ratio of the total population at a point
of time is known as ‘the overall sex ratio’.
</p>

<p>
Determinants of Overall Sex Ratio

 The sex— age composition of any population is determined by past trends in
 fertility, mortality and migration, whereas the overall sex ratio is the result of
 the combined outcome of the following three factors:

i. Sex ratio of newborn babies or the sex ratio at birth

ii. Sex ratio of the deceased persons

iii. Sex ratio of the new migrants

Each of these three factors plays a significant role in determining the overall
sex ratio.
</p>

<p>
Sex Ratio at Birth

  There is no 1:1 relationship in the male and female births. The number of male
babies is always to some extent higher. An examination of the sex ratios of
registered births for a large number of countries over a wide range of periods
indicates that the sex ratio of births is above 100 for nearly all countries from
which complete data are available. Sex ratio at birth is determined biologically,
and therefore, only insignificant variations are observed from population
to population. It appears that nature’s balance is slightly more favourable
to males at birth. The sex ratio at birth depends upon the sex ratios of two
biological antecedent events: (i) sex ratio at the time of conception and (ii)
sex ratio of foetal losses or deaths. The sex of foetus is determined at the time
of fertilization. But, there is no direct means of observing this ratio at conception.
Many researchers, however, attempted to estimate it indirectly on
the basis of the sex ratio of birds. The sex ratio at conception, known as the
primary sex ratio, is much higher than the sex ratio of live births or foetal
deaths. An examination of these ratios of stillbirths shows that there is a comparatively
higher proportion of male babies to stillborn babies.

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000170">170</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 170
</h1>
<p>

 The sex ratio at birth is determined primarily by biological factors, variations,
and is caused due to demographic factors though only of a small magnitude.
The most important of the demographic factors is the age of mothers
and the order of live births. There is a reverse relationship between the age of
the mother and the birth order of the child on the one hand, and the sex ratio
at birth on the other. Among the lower- order births, especially the first- and
second- order births, the sex ratios are higher. In other words, comparatively
more male babies are born between the first and the second born. Lower-
order births are associated with the lower age of the mother and the sex ratio
of births.
 </p>

 <p>
It is found that during the two World Wars and the post-war period, the
sex ratio at birth had showed an increase in some of the European countries.
It is considered by some biologists that, as many men had lost their
lives in these wars, some ‘meta- biological force’ was in operation, attempting
to redress the war losses. However, later it was realized that during the
wars and the post-war period, the age at marriage had gone down in Europe.
As a consequence, the age of childbearing also came down and resulted in
an increase in the births of the newborn babies. As the sex ratio of birth is
high for first— and second— order births, the result is an increased sex ratio of
births.
 </p>

 <p>
Sex Ratio of Deceased Persons

Differential mortality of males and females is another important factor that
influenced the overall sex ratio and the sex ratio at various ages. Compared
to the sex ratio of births, those of deceased persons show greater variations
from country to country. Data on sex ratios of the dead in various countries
indicate that with the exception of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the difference
in the values of the sex ratios of the deceased are much above 100.
In other words, more than 1000 males die per 1000 females. The male foetus
is biologically more delicate than the female foetus and is, therefore, at a
disadvantage, with the result that there is a higher proportion of male babies
in stillbirth. Even after birth, the male baby continues to be biologically disadvantaged.
This fact is reflected in the higher male mortality rates not only
on the sex ratio of foetal deaths, i.e., gestation period, the first day, in the
first week, the first month and the first year, but also throughout life. In fact,
in most countries, the crude death rates for males are higher than those for
females.
 </p>

  <p>
Sex Ratio of Net Migrants

The third factor affecting the overall sex ratio of any population is the sex ratio
of the net migrants that is essentially socio—economic in nature. Migrations
are ordinarily sex- selective. In most countries, the volume of international
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000171">171</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:171
</h1>
<p>
migrations is not significant enough to have any marked impact on the sex
structure of the population. Internal migration is sex selective, but more so
in the case of males. When persons of one sex dominate among internal
migrants, the sex ratios of the various regions of the country are affected.
In India, the proportion of males is high among the migrants who go from
rural areas to urban areas.
</p>

<p>
Sex Ratio in India: An Analysis from 1901 to 2001

Indian Census has the tradition of bringing out disaggregated information
by sex ratio on various aspects of population. The first and foremost is the
simple count of males and females. A change in sex composition largely
reflects the underlying socio-economic and cultural patterns of a society
in different ways. Sex ratio is an important social indicator to measure the
extent of prevailing equity between males and females in a society at a given
point of time. It is mainly the outcome of the interplay of sex differentials in
mortality, sex selective migration, sex ratio at birth and, at times, the sex differential
in population enumeration.

<p>
The trends in sex ratio for the past 100 years in respect of all the states
and union territories, except Arunachal Pradesh due to the non-availability
of the data, present the nature of sex ratio. In 1901, 11 states and union territories
had sex ratio of more than unity. Among these, except Kerala all other
states and union territories have revealed a downward slide. The major states
that are largely responsible for the decline in the overall sex ratio in India
are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh,
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Although the sex ratio in Punjab is
consistently low, it has shown a long-term upward trend and has not contributed
to the overall deterioration in sex ratio of the country. In Rajasthan,
the sex ratio kept fluctuating in a narrow margin and always remained at a
low level. Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are the states where the
sex ratio has remained more or less stagnant. In West Bengal, the sex ratio
declined sharply between 1901 and 1941 and followed a gradual turnaround
in an upward path to reach 934 in 2001.
  </p>

   <p>
The sex ratios of different populations are imbalanced. It is estimated
that around the year 2000, the world had 986 females against 1000 males.
Table 8.4 presents the global sex ratio and that of the 10 most populous ,
countries in the world as estimated for the year 2000. Except Indonesia and
Japan, the other Asian countries showed low sex ratios. The mere weight of
the population of these four Asian countries with low sex ratio appears to
be largely responsible for the overall prevalence of males over females in the

<p>

The trends in the sex ratio of a few selected countries for the period 1950—2000
are examined to understand the trends of different countries. It is interesting
to note that the sex ratio in the USA, Indonesia, Russian Federation and
Japan has always remained above unity for the last 50 years. The most dramatic
decline of about 200 points in the sex ratio is seen in the Russian Federation. In
the USA, it has shown an improvement from 1002 to 1029 in the last 50 years.
Bangladesh has shown a continuous improvement in its sex ratio to reach from
880 in 1950 to 953 in 2000. Pakistan and China too have showed an improvement.
Thus, among the major nations of the world, India is the only exception.
 </p>

<p>
Negative Sex Composition in India

The sex ratio of Indian population is the current interest of the demographers,
social scientists, women’s groups, research scholars, and various planners
and policy makers. Several reasons are attributed to the consistently low
levels of sex ratio and their further decline in the country. They are as follows:

i. Neglect of the girl child resulting in their mortality at younger ages
ii. High maternal mortality
iii. Sex selective female abortions
iv. Female infanticide
v. Change in the sex ratio at birth
 </p>

<p>
The imbalance in the number of males and females starts much after birth.
There are in fact more number of females than males at birth. However,
the social conditions are responsible for a negative female sex ratio. Many
demographers believe that this creates an uneven social imbalance.

<p>
The high sex ratio observed in India and in other culturally similar
Countries is rather unusual as compared to other developing and developed
countries. There are certain factors that are responsible for this unusual pattern
of a higher number of males than females in the total population. These
factors are as follows:

i. Differential enumeration of males and females in the Indian Census;
ii. Unusually high sex ratio of births in India;
iii. Higher mortality of females in India; and
iv. Male- dominated international migration.
 </p>

 <p>
 Differential Enumeration of Males and Females in Indian Census

In a developing country like India, there is a possibility of disproportionate
enumeration of males and females in the Census counting. In
other words, the high sex ratio in India is due to under—enumeration of
females or over- enumeration of males. After a careful study of the high
sex ratio in the Indian population, the demographers came to the conclusion
that tuner- enumeration of females cannot explain more than an
exceptionally small part of the numerical imbalance between males and
females.
 </p>

<p>
Sex Ratio of Births

Male predominance at birth is primarily a biological phenomenon and does
not differ much from country to country. Studies in India indicate that the
Indian sex ratio at birth is keeping in tune with this biological pattern. The
low proportion of females in India is due to a large extent to higher female
mortality.
 </p>

<p>
High Mortality of Females

The male foetus is known to be biologically weaker than the female foetus.
This biological disadvantage is reflected in the higher male mortality rate on
the first day, in the first week, the first month and the first year of life. The
evidence of higher female mortality is the main explanation for the imbalance
between males and females in India. The social scientists suggest that
the higher mortality rates of females in India are attributed to the inferior
status they are accorded as second— class citizens. The aversion to the female
children is found even in the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries.
The numerous KAP studies, i.e., the studies of knowledge, attitude and practice,\
with respect to family planning in India revealed the strong preference
the parents have for male children. Besides, they preferred to have at least

 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000179">179</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 179
</h1>
<p>
two sons before accepting a terminal method of family planning. There is
a differential treatment given to the sick male and female children —The
female children are given free traditional treatment or did not receive any
specialized treatment, while male children received treatment from qualified
doctors. Maternal mortality rates in rural India are shockingly high.
</p>

<p>
Male- dominated International Migration

Sex selective international migration is very insignificant and, therefore, has
not affected the sex ratio in India. The excessive female mortality in India
because of the low status of women is an important factor contributing to
the higher proportion of males in the total population. The sex ratio of the
population has risen from 1029 males per 1000 females in 1901 to 1079 in
1991 and then fallen slightly to 1071 in 2001. The latter is probably due to
the improved coverage of females in the 2001 as compared with the 1991
Census and the same seems to be the case With the reported declines in 1951
and 1958.
</p>

<p>
The historical sex bias in favour of males in India and the rise in the sex
ratio still needs an explanation. If it is due to the anti- female bias of Indians,
this bias is increasing to yield the trends in increasing male preference over
the twentieth century. But,
</p>

</h1>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000181">181</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
The paradox is resolved by observing, from the table, that the life expectancy
for females did not catch up with and surpass that for males till
1981. This fall in lag in female mortality as compared with that for males
is sufficient to explain the rising sex ratio. If the successive cohorts of children
born in the intervals between decennial censuses experience higher
rates of survival than those that have preceded them, then those cohorts
will be correspondingly larger. If the boys in each of those new cohorts
experience slightly greater improvement than the girls, we might well find
that while all children gain in survival, during the period of population
transition, the number of males would become larger than the number of
females.
  </p>

The sex ratio in the age group 0—6 has decreased at a much faster pace
than the overall sex ratio of the country after 1981. The decreasing sex ratio
in this child population perhaps has a cascading effect on the population
over a period of time leading to diminishing sex ratio in the country. The
imbalance that has set in this early age group is difficult to remove and would
remain to haunt the population for a long time to come. Demographically,
the sex ratio of 927 of the population in the age group 0—6 does not appear
to augur well for the future of the country. Sharp declines are reported in
the child sex ratios during 1991—2001 in Himachal Pradesh from 951 to
897, Punjab from 875 to 793, Chandigarh from 869 to 845, Uttaranchal
from 948 to 906, Haryana from 879 to 820, Gujarat from 928 to 878 and
Maharashtra from 946 to 917. Perhaps, the sharp declines in the child sex
ratios are indicative of an underlying trend of sex selective abortions in
these areas and some more data is awaited in order to draw definite conclusions
in this regard.

<p>
AGE STRUCTURE

The distribution of the population according to age is one of the significant
characteristics of Indian population. The age structure of a population
affects a nation’s key socio-economic issues. Countries with young populations
(high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while
countries with older population (high percentage of those aged 65 and over)
need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be used
to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid growth of
unemployed young adult population can lead to unrest.
  </p>

<p>
The United Nations has defined age as ‘the estimated or calculated
interval of time between the date of birth and the date of census, expressed,
in complete solar years’. It is recommended that information about age
should be collected in the census by asking the date of birth of the individual
(day, month and year) or by asking a direct question in order to obtain

  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000182">182</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:182
</h1>
<p>
information on the age at the last birthday or by asking both these questions
together. Though the question on the date of birth obviously yields
more accurate information of age, it is not always possible to obtain the
date of birth from a population in which the majority is either illiterate or
semi -literate. In such a situation, asking about the age completed on the last
birthday gathers information.
 </p>

<p>
AlthOugh it is easy enough to ask questions on age, it is extremely difficult
to obtain correct information about age when people are illiterate or
semi- literate and are ignorant about their oWn age. In India, it is not uncommon
for enumerators or investigators in a census or demographic survey
being told, ‘I do not know my age or may be I am 30 or 35 years old or otherwise
you decide how old I am’, etc. The practice of registering births is not
yet followed widely in India, so birth certificates are not available. The Indian
age data, therefore, show concentration of population at a certain age, mostly
in numbers ending with 0 or 5. Errors in age reporting also creep in because
of carelessness in reckoning age, misunderstanding of the question or deliberate
misstatement. As the age data is defective because of several reasons,
demographers first evaluate them to determine the nature and magnitude of
errors and then make the necessary adjustments before using such data for
demographic analysis.
 </p>

<p>
Analysis of the Age Structure

The data on age is available in the form of single years, i.e., the number of
persons in the population of age 13, 14, 15, etc. In the demographic analysis,
the age data as available is not used. Usually, the data is classified into the following
five age groups: (i) 0—4; (ii) 5—9; (iii) 10—14; (iv)15—19; and (v) 20—24.
It is classified into mutually exclusive age groups. This kind of data is used in
the analysis of the age structure of any population and also for a wide variety
of analytical purposes.
 </p>


<p>
The age structure of any population is most commonly studied with the
help of a simple mathematical measure like the percentage distribution and
an equally simple measure like the age pyramid. The other measures used
for such an analysis of the age structure are the average age (mean, median,
mode) and a few other indices based on the distribution of persons in various
age groups.
 </p>

<p>
The simplest measure is the percentage distribution of the population
based on the absolute numbers in various 5-year age groups. It indicates the
number of persons in an age group from out of the total number of persons
considered. This measure helps in forming an idea about the age structure of
any population, and is used for describing it. It is also used to compare the
age structure of two or more populations at a point of time or to compare the
age structure of the same population at different points of time.
 </p>

<p>
Age Pyramids

  The age— sex histograms known as the age— sex pyramids are used precisely
to compare the age structures of two Or more populations at a point of time
or to compare the age structure of the same population at different points of
time. It is a graphical approach adopted in the study of the age structure of
population.
 </p>

<p>
  A population pyramid represents the age and sex structure of a population
using bar graphs to represent the percentage or number of people in
each age— sex group. In contrast to a typical bar graph, the graphs are on their
sides with the axis in the middle. This means that they often take the shape
of ‘pyramids’ as the size of the population in the upper ages is smaller than
that in the lower ages. This graph allows one to compare the relative size of
age and sex groups at a glance.
 </p>

 <p>
Age Pyramids Developing and Developed Countries

Let us examine population pyramids for typical ‘developed’ and
‘developing’ countries of the world in 1990. These figures very graphically
indicate the different age structures for the two sets of countries.
The developing countries have a pOpulation structure that resembles
a pyramid with a broad base of young and a small apex of old population.
Mexico in 1995 is an example of a pyramid fOr a developing
country.
 </p>

<p>
The developed countries are beginning to lose their ‘pyramidal’
shape as they become more straight up and down With almost equal
number of people in adjacent age groups until the ages of high death
rates begin after age 65. Finland 1n 1996 IS an example of a pyramid
for a developed country.
 </p>

<p>
Dependency Ratio

Dependency ratio is a measure of the portion of a population that is
composed of dependents (people who are either too young or too old
to work). The dependency ratio is equal to the number of individuals
aged below 15 or above 64 divided by the number of individuals
aged between 15 and 64, expressed as a percentage. A rising dependency
ratio is a concern in many countries that are facing an ageing population,
since it becomes difficult for pension and social security systems to
provide for a significantly older, non- working population. Another crucial
aspect in the study of the composition of the population is the dependency
ratio. It indicates the number of dependents per worker, and is computed
on the basis of three broad age groups, i.e. below 15, between 15 and 59 or
15 and 64, and above 60 or 65. The population in the age group 15—59 or
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000184">184</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:184
</h1>
<p>
15—64 is considered the working population. Those below 15 are considered
young dependents, and those above either 60 or 65 are considered old
dependents.
</p>

<p>
Countries that have a high dependency ratio have more people who are
not of working age, and fewer who are working and paying taxes. The higher
the number, the more are the people who need looking after.

The following formula is employed in computing the dependency
ratio:


Dependency Ratio  = (P0-14+P60/ P15-59)K

where,
P0-14+P60+ and P15_ 59 denote the population in the age groups 0-14, 60+
and 15— 59, respectively, and
K = 100.

Young Dependency Ratio = (P0-14/P15-59) K

Old Dependency Ratio   = (P60+/P15-59) K

Total Dependency Ratio = Young Dependency Ratio
                     	+ Old Dependency Ratio
</p>

<p>
The dependency ratio is not a completely accurate measure for assessing
the dependency burden, because not all persons in the working age are
employed and all those in the dependent age are not economic dependents.
This measure, however, provides a broad idea of economic dependency in
any population and IS widely used.
</p>

<p>
The age structures of different populations are usually compared in
terms of broad age groups that identify persons in the working age, children
as being under the working age and others as being above the working age;
these age groups are: below 15, 15—64 and above 65.
</p>

Ageing : Demographic Transition in India

Ageing is the most significant outcome of the process known as demographic
transition. A decrease in fertility leads to a decline in the proportion of the
young in the population. The decline in mortality means a longer life span
for individuals. Ageing involVes a shift from high mortality/ high fertility to
low mortality /low fertility rate and consequently an increased proportion
of older people in the total population. India is undergoing such a demographic
transition.
</p>

<p>
   In 1947, when India became independent from the British rule, life
expectancy was around 32 years. Improvements in public health and medical
services controlled specific infectious diseases and consequently a decrease
in the death rates. Life expectancy at birth rose steadily and by 1990 had
reached 60 years (60.51 for females and 60.31 for males). Improved sanitation,
increased attention to maternal health and better childcare facilities
greatly reduced infant mortality. Government sponsored family planning
measures made some impact, especially in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
Total fertility rates (i.e., the average number of children a woman will
have had by the end of her reproductive life) decreased from 5.97 in 1950 to
3.56 in 1990. It is estimated that by 2000, the crude birth rate may be around
25 and the crude death rate less than 9 per 1000 population. The shape of the
population pyramid will gradually Change from a wide base/ narrow top, to
a barrel- shaped form.
</p>

<p>
The UN defines a country as ‘ageing’ where the proportion of people
above 60 reaches 7 per cent. By 2000, India exceeded that proportion (7.7
per cent) and is expected to reach 12.6 per cent in 2025.
</p>

<p>
Indian culture, like many other Asian cultures, emphasized filial piety.
Parents are honoured as gods. It is considered the duty of a son to respect
his parents and take care of them. Even today, in India, old parents live with
son/s and their families. Living with the eldest son and his family is the most
common arrangement. Indian society is patriarchal and after marriage sons
bring their wives to the parental household to live. This tradition assured
that old people would have younger in- laws and grandchildren to care of
them. Also, the caste and kin groups exert pressure on younger members to
obey and respect elders.

<p>
In modern India, retirement age is fixed at 58 for most of the Government
jobs, and 60 years in the universities. For all practical purposes, people
above 60 are considered ‘senior citizens’. In academic research, retirement
age is often taken as an index of aged status. Chronological age of 58 or 60
is considered the beginning of old age. The aged population of India is currently
the second largest in the world. The absolute number of the above 60
population in India will increase from 76 million in 2001 to 137 million by
2021. Table 8.9 shows the gradual rise in the elderly population in India.

</p>

<p>
Demographers have worked out the dependency ratio, which basically
takes into account the working versus non—working sections in the population
and find it rising steadily. This means the burden of a larger group of
elder people is to be borne by a relatively smaller group of younger working
adult

Demographic changes influence health, economic activity and social conditions
of people. As the age structure of developing countries changes,
demands on resources by different segments of population are expected
to grow. From the available information, two assumptions are made. First
of all, the prolongation of lifespan does not necessarily mean that ‘life has
been added’ to these extended years. Secondly, the state is not likely to have
adequate resources to meet the demands on its services created by a larger
number of elderly people. India, as one of the largest and most stable democracies
in the Asian region, has its share of developmental problems. There
are many priorities that may push the interest of the older people to the
background.
</p>

<p>
   Urbanization is the process in which the number of people living in cities
increases compared with the number of people living in rural areas. A
country is considered urbanized when over 50 per cent of its population
lives in urban places.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the first countries to become urbanized were the Great Britain
and some European countries. Their urbanization was relatively slow, allowing
governments’ time to plan and provide for the needs of increasing urban
population.
</p>

<p>
Urbanization is most rapid in the Third World countries, where the
world’s largest cities exist. Mexico City, the world’s largest city, has a population
of more than 18 million, and is estimated to grow to over 26 million by
the year 2000. Sao Paulo, Brazil, has more than 16 million people and it is
estimated to reach 24 million in the year 2000.
</p>


<p>
URBANIZATION IN INDIA

Urbanization is the movement of population from rural to urban areas and
the resulting increasing proportion of a population that resides in urban
rather than rural places. It is derived from the Latin Urbs a term used by the
Romans to a city. Urban sociology is the sociology of urban living; of people
in groups and social relationship in urban social circumstances and situation.
Thompson Warren has defined it as the movement of people from communities
concerned chiefly or solely with agriculture to other communities
generally larger whose activities are primarily centred in government, trade,
manufacture or allied interests. Urbanization is a two- way process because
it involves not only movement from village to cities and change from agricultural
occupation to business, trade, service and profession, but it also
involves change in the migrants’ attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviour
patterns. The process of urbanization is rapid all over the world. Facilities
like education, health care system, employment avenues, civic facilities and
social welfare are reasons attracting people to urban areas. The census of
India defines some criteria for urbanization. These are:
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000189">189</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:189
</h1>
<p>
Population is more than 5000
The density is over 400 persons per sq km
75 per cent of the male population engages in non-agricultural
occupations.
 </p>

 <p>
Cities are urban areas with population more than 1 lakh.
Metropolises are cities with population of more than one million.
 </p>

 <p>
(Source: www.sociologyguide.com)
</p>

<p>
It is a recognized fact that differences exist between the population living
in rural areas and that living in urban areas. Many countries of the world
are at present undergoing rapid urbanization. Any demographic study of
urbanization is mainly concerned with the level and tempo of change in the
distribution of the population between urban and non- urban areas. Such a
demographic study is important because it provides the basic information
that enables us to formulate development plans and to implement development
programmes.
 </p>

<p>
The concept of an urban place embraces the area demarcated as urban
regardless of boundary- determining criteria. The following are some of the
criteria that are used to determine the urban status of an area:

i. Size of the population
ii. Density of the population
iii. Prominent economic activity
iv. Administrative function or structure, i.e., the type of local
government
 </p>

<p>
The United Nations has defined the urban localities into three types: (i)
administrative, (ii) economic and (iii) ecological. The administrative urban
locality is based on the type of the government. The economic definition
conSiders the type of eConomic activity of the working population, with no
more than a specified percentage of their economically active population
engaged in agriculture, and the ecological definition of agglomerations covers
the internationally recommended definition of localities as population
cultures within the contours of dense settlement, irrespective of administrative
delimitations, size or economic type.
 </p>

<p>
The United Nations has identified three main types of localities in the
classification of urban areas: (i) agglomerations or clusters of population
without regard to official boundaries or administrative functions; (ii) localities
with fixed boundaries, having a legally recognized ‘town’ status, some
form of local government and an official designation as ‘city’, ‘borough’, ‘urban
district’ or ‘municipality’; and (iii) minor civil divisions, such as communes
with fixed boundaries, that actually comprise the entire country and may or
may not have local government or ‘town status’.

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000190">190</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:190
</h1>
<p>
In India, since the 1961 Census, a rigorous definition of ‘urban’ is adopted.
In the earlier census operations, all municipal areas continue to be classified
as ‘urban’ irrespective of whether or not they fulfil the other criteria and the
definitions continue to be administrative oriented. Non- municipal areas are
entitled to be classified as urban, if they fulfil the following conditions:

. There should be a population density of not less than 1000 persons
per square mile.

. Should have a population of 5000 or more.

. Three- fourths of the population should be engaged in non— agricultural
operations.
 </p>

<p>
The fact that all municipal areas are automatically considered urban
occasionally makes comparisons difficult even among areas in the same
country, because, according to the Constitution of India, each state is
allowed to determine the municipal status of a unit. It is obvious that it is
not possible to adopt a uniform definition of ‘urban’ areas for all countries
of the world. The United Nations recommended that due to the national
differences of the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas,
the distinction between urban and rural population is not yet amenable to
a single definition applicable to all countries. Hence, each country should
decide for itself which areas are urban and which are rural. But, this kind
of classification makes it difficult to make international comparisons.
The International Urban Research Center at the University of California,
Berkeley has offered the decisive factor for deciding whether or not a locality
is urban should be the size of the population in that locality, that should
be fixed at 20,000 or more. This recommendation has received wide support
internationally.
 </p>

<p>
Locality

A locality is defined as ‘a distinct population cluster (inhabited place, settlement,
population nucleus, etc.) of which the inhabitants live in closely adjacent
structures’. The locality usually has a commonly recognized name, but
it may be named or delineated for purposes of the census. Localities are not
necessarily the same as the smallest civil division of a country.
 </p>

<p>
Urban Agglomeration

It is a large locality of a country such as a city or a town that is often a part of
an urban agglomeration, which comprises the city or town proper and also
the suburban fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent
to its boundaries. The urban agglomeration is, therefore, not identical with
the locality, but is an additional geographic unit that includes more than one
locality.

 </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000191">191</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
Urban population refers to the population that lives in urban areas,
whatever be the criteria for adopted ‘urban’. Urban growth refers to changes
in the size of either an urban place or an urban population. Growth in an
urban place may take place as a result of an expansion of the boundaries of
an urban area or of reclassification of areas as urban according to predetermined
criteria. Growth in an urban population may take place because of
the consequent growth of an urban place as a reSult of the above two reasons,
or because of a natural increase and net migration.
</p>

<p>
According to the Census 2001, in India, out of the total population of
1027 million, about 285 million live in urban areas and 742 million in rural
areas. Thus, around 28 out of every 100 persons in India live in urban areas.
This is only 2 more than the number that lived in urban areas a decade ago.
For every 100 persons living in rural area of India, 39 live in urban areas,
which are 4 more than the number in 1991. The percent urban population
and urban— rural ratio (urban population per hundred rural population)
are the commonly used measures of degree of urbanization. In the year
2000, about 47 per cent of the world population is living in urban areas. .It
effectively meant that for every 100 people living in rural areas of the world,
90 lived in urban areas. Given below are the percentages of urban population
and urban— rural ratios for the year 2000 as estimated by the United
Nations for various regions, continents and 10 most populous countries of
the world.
</p>

<p>
 The degree of urbanization in world, regions, continents
and top 10 most populous countries in the world. The two measures
of degree of urbanization included are the percent urban population
and urban— rural ratio. While in the more developed countries about three
quarters of people live in urban areas, in the least developed countries only
around a quarter of the population live in urban areas. Among the continents,
the lowest proportion of urban population is found in Asia which
is only 37 per cent. Brazil is the most urbanized and Bangladesh is the
least urbanized among the 10 most populous countries in the world; theSe
have around 81 per cent and 25 per cent of the population living in urban
areas, respectively. In terms of urban- rural ratio, the developed regions
of the world had three times as much population living in urban areas in
comparison to rural areas. In contrast, in the least developed countries,
only about a third of every hundred persons living in rural areas live in
urban areas. The urban— rural ratios for Africa and Asia are almost equal
to around 60. It is much less when compared with Europe, North America
and South America. The degree of urbanization in India is the lowest in
the world.

OCCUPATIONAL COMPOSITION

The entire population of India is not involved in the production of goods and
services consumed by the entire population. The economically active population
is that part of human resources which actually takes part, or tries to
take part, in the production of goods and serviCes. The study of the economically
active population or labour force occupies an important position in the
field of social demography. The economic and social development of a nation
depends on the number of economically active persons, the quality of their
work and the regularity of their employment. The statistics on labour force
are available from the national census. The analysis of the census provides
information about the occupation composition, its absolute size as well as
the proportion of the adult population constituting it. These statistics, thus,
provide an inventory of nation’s supply of labour engaged in or available for
economic activity. Labour force participating rates are useful to understand
the extent to which women, children and the aged participate in economic
activity. A study of the labour force also covers employment, unemployment
and underemployment as well as the industrial and occupational structure
of the population.
</p>

<p>
According to the United Nations definition, ‘an economically active
pOpulation comprises all persons of either sex, who furnish the supply of
labor available for the production of economic goods and services during
the time reference period chosen for the investigation.’ It also includes persons
in the civilian labour force and those serving in the armed forces.
</p>

<p>
The two categories are differentiated in the following manner:
</p>

<p>
Employed

The employed category comprise all persons, including family workers, who
worked during the time reference period established for data on economic
characteristics, or who had a job in which, they were temporarily absent
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000194">194</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no : 194
</h1>
<p>
	because of illness or injury, industrial dispute, vacation, the leave of absence,
absence without leave or temporary disorganization of work due to such
reasons as bad weather or mechanized breakdown. In the censuses reports,
the employed are further classified into main worker, marginal worker and
non- worker.
</p>

<p>
   Main worker is a person who had participated in work in a major part,
i.e., 6 months or more of the preceding one year before the date of enumeration.
If the period is less than 6 months, the person is considered a marginal
worker; those who do not qualify as either main workers or marginal workers
are classified as non- workers in the census. In 1981 Census, the terms ‘main
activity’ and ‘workers’ as used in the 1971 Census were clubbed and a new
term main worker emerged. Hence, the three categories: (i), main worker, (ii)
marginal worker and (iii) non- worker. The period of work was 183 days or
more for main workers and less than 183 days for marginal workers during
the reference period. In the 1991 Census, all questions on workers and non-
workers remained the same as in the 1981 Census, including collection of
information on ‘Seeking| Available’ for work from non- workers to the number
of entrants to the labour force. In the 2001 Census, this information was
collected not only from non- workers but also from marginal workers.

The workers are classified into four categories:

i. Cultivator.
ii. Agricultural labourer.
iii. Worker in household industry.
iv. Other workers; these are those engaged in some economic activity
during the last one year but were not cultivators or agricultural
labourers or engaged in household industry.
</p>

<p>
  The information is collected based on the nature of occupation or the actual
work that a person did during the last one year. These incorporated persons
work in an office, factory, firm, workshop, business house, bank, school, shop,
etc. Besides, full details of the type and nature of industry, trade or service,
the sector of economy in which the person was engaged is also provided.
</p>

<p>
Unemployed

The unemployed category are those persons, who during the time reference
period, were not working but were seeking work for pay or profit, including
those who never worked before. It also includes people who are not seeking
work because of temporary illness, because they made arrangements to start
a new job subsequent to the time reference period, or because they were
on temporary or indefinite lay-off without pay where employment opportunities
are limited. In brief, it comprises all persons engaged in, or actively

 </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000195">195</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:195
</h1>
<p>
seeking, productive work in some branch of the economy during a specified
period of time. The terms such as ‘ labour force’, economically active population’,
and ‘working population’ are used synonymously in demographic
literature.
</p>

<p>
Population that is Not Economically Active

This group compriSes the following categories:

i. Homemakers are persons of either sex, who are not economically
active and engaged in household duties in their own home. For example,
housewives and other relatives who are responsible for the care of
the home and children.

ii. Students belonging to either sex, who attend any regular educational
institutions, public or private, for systematic instructions at any level
of education.

iii. Income recipients including both men and women who receive
income from property or other investment, royalties or pensions for
economic activities in the past.

iv. Others are persons of either sex, who receive aid or private support,
as well as all other persons who do not fall in any of the mentioned
categories, like the children who do not attend school.

In the 1971 Census of India, on the basis of their main activity the classification
of economically active or not active population is done. In the 1981
Census of India, a question on whether one was ‘seeking or available for
work’ in the case of non- workers and marginal Workers was introduced.
</p>

<p>
Time Reference Period

The United Nations has recommended that the time reference period should
not be longer than one Week, while collecting the data on economically
active population. In the Census of India 1971, the reference period of work
in case of regular employment in trade, profession, service or business was
one week prior to the date of enumeration. For those who are engaged in
seasonal work such as cultivation, livestock keeping, plantation work, household
industry and others, the time reference period was the last Working
season prior to the date of enumeration. If any person had regularly worked
for at least half of the normal number of days during the major portion of
the working season, he or she was treated as a worker. In the Census of India
2001, the time reference period for considering a person as a worker was
‘one year’ preceding the date of enumeration. Certain types of economic
activities such as agriculture, household industry like jaggery making, etc.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000196">196</pagenum>

<p>
are carried on either throughout the year or only during certain seasons or
parts of the year depending on some local circumstances. In such cases, the
time reference period was the broad time span of the agricultural seasons
preceding the enumeration. The economic activities pursued by the person

RELIGIONS IN INDIA


Religion is one of the oldest basic socio—cultural characteristics associated
with the humans and civilizations created by them over thousands of years
of known history. Different communities and people perceive religion in
their own unique way. For some, religion has evolved as an established set of
beliefs, rituals and traditional practices and worship of one Supreme Being
or deity that may be their own caste/ tribe deity, or village deity. At the same
time, some others may worship a number of gods and goddesses. Still, there
are others who practice and perceive religion in their own way and these
beliefs are codified in various scriptures or inherited and handed over from
one generation to another. Only a handful few claim to be atheists. However,
despite deviations in the manifestation of their expressions of belief, people
generally believe in one or the other divine power that created the universe
and is taking care of all human beings. A large number of religion returns
encountered at each census in India confirm that different people understand
and express religious identity in their own way. The population census
provides people collectively an opportunity to express their individual faith/
belief freely, in small or large numbers, which ultimately enter and find place
in the official records.
</p>

<p>
Religion returns in the Indian census provide a wonderful kaleidoscope
of the country’s rich social composition, as many religions have originated
and certain other religions of foreign origin have flourished to a great extent
here. India has the distinction of being the land from where certain important
religions of the world namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and
Jainism originated. Our country is also the origin of some of the indigenous
faiths/ tribal religions that have survived the influence of many major religions
for centuries and are still holding ground firmly. Regional co-existence
of several religious groups in the country makes it unique and the epithet
‘unity in diversity’ is brought out clearly in the census reports.
</p>

<p>
Religions in the Indian Census Reports

From its inception, the Census Reports of India contains information about
the religious affiliation as expressed by the people of India. Population Census

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000197">197</pagenum>

<p>
in India has the rare distinction of being the only instrument that collects
the individual information on this diverse but most common Characteristic
Of the Indian population but keeps it confidential except for aggregating
it at certain minimum geographic level. Religion being one of the basic
socio-cultural characteristics of any society, due emphasis and care is taken
while collecting information with regard to the followers of various religions
including the minor religious beliefs, faiths and persuasions. The information
collected through census questionnaire is tabulated and presented in
the form of religion tables. The religion data gathered and disseminated at
the decennial census generates immense interest in various ways among all
sections of the society and reflects the social composition and dynamics at a
particular point of time. The precise names of various religions are expressed
a bit differently in the census. By and large, there is complete consistency
in the expressions used for signifying a particular religion. But, its scope of
inclusion varied marginally while tabulating and publishing data.
</p>


<p>
In the 1872 Census, the religion of each person was recorded, for example,
Hindus, Mohammedans, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsees, Jews, etc.
In case of those persons who believed in the divinity of Christ, name of the
particular sect or church to which they belonged to was recorded such as
Armenian, Baptist, Greek, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Wesleyon, etc.
Native converts into Christianity were shown as Native Christians. Persons
who returned to their religions such as Brahmos, Buddhists, Chinese, Jains,
Jews, Parsees, Sikhs, etc. were recorded without any further subdivision.
In the 1891 Census, the term Animistic was adopted comprehensively for
the religions of forest tribes who did not accept Hindu system and were not
converted into either Christianity or Islam. In the first census after independence
that took place in 1951, actual religion name as reported by the
respondent, for example, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist,
Zoroastrian, Jew, other religion (tribal) and other religion (non- tribal) was
recorded for each and every individual.
</p>

<p>
In the Census of India 2001, as in the previous censuses, the information
relating to this important characteristic of all individuals was collected
as reported by them. Since the provision of individual slips was dOne
away within the Census 2001, the individual responses to the question on
religion were recorded in the HousehOld Schedule only for each member
independently.
</p>

<p>
One of the unique features of Indian Census is that it captures the
diverse cultural heritage of the country at the population enumeration and
keeps its identity intact while collating and tabulating basic population data.
The Primary Census Abstract for the Total Population, the Scheduled Castes
Population and the Scheduled Tribes Population released earlier provided
basic population characteristics of the total population by residence and sex
for India, at the state, district, town and city level. The first report on religion

<p>
data succinctly brings out the salient population characteristics by different
religious affiliations of the population.
     	Some of the key findings from the Census reports are as follows:
</p>

<p>
Population of Religious Groups, Their Distribution and Growth Rate

   At the national level, of the 1028 million population, 828 million (80.5 per
cent) have returned as their religion as Hindus followed by 138 million (13.4
per cent) as Muslims and 24 million (2.3 per cent) Christians. While 19 million
(1.9 per cent) are of Sikh religion; 8 million (0.8 per cent) are Buddhists
and 4.2 million (0.4 per cent) are Jains as per the 2001 Census. In addition
to these, 6.6 million belong to ‘Other Religions and Persuasions’ including
tribal religions which are not a part of the six main religions stated above.
About 7 lakh (or 0.7 million) persons have not stated their religion.
</p>
<p>
The Sikh population has recorded the lowest decadal growth rate of 16.9
per cent during 1991-2001 and has also shown declining trends in the growth
since 1961—71. The growth rate of Hindu population has come down from
22.8 per cent in 1981—91 to 20.0 per cent in 1991—2001. Similar trends are
</p>


<p>
 The data excludes Mao- Maram, Paomata and Purul subdivisions of Senapati District of Manipur.
 The data is ‘unadjusted’ (without excluding Assam and the Jammu and Kashmir); the 1981 Census was not
conducted in Assam and 1991 Census was not conducted in Jammu and Kashmir. It should also be noted that
about 40 per cent of the Hindus speak Hindi while the rest speak Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati,
Kannada and other languages. Almost 70 per cent of the Muslims speak Urdu while the rest speak Kashmiri,
Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil, Gujarati and other languages. About One— third of the Christians speak Malayalam,
one- sixth speak Tamil while the rest speak a variety of languages.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000199">199</pagenum>

<p>
observed among Buddhists that declined from 36.0 per cent in 1981-91 to 23.2
per cent during 1991—2001. The Muslim growth rate declined from 32.9 per
cent during 1981—91 to 29.3 per cent during 1991—2001, while for Christians
it increased from 17.0 per cent to 22.1 per cent during 1991-2001. In addition,
Jain population has also registered growth rate of 26.0 per cent against very low
growth rate of 4.6 per cent during 1981—91. In brief, the emergence of ‘Other
Religions and Persuasions’ is one of the key findings of the» Census 2001.
</p>

<p>
Sex Ratio of Population (Number of Females per Thousand Males)

At the national level, Christian population has the highest sex ratio of 1009
females per thousand males at the 2001 Census followed by ‘Other Religions
and Persuasions’ (992), Buddhists (953) and Jains (940). Sex ratio of Sikh
population is 893, which is the lowest among the different religious communities.
Sex ratio among Muslim population at the national level is 936 which
is just above the national average of 933 for all religions while a shade lower
is the Hindu population sex ratio at 931.
</p>

<p>
   	Among the states, the highest sex ratio (1058) is reported among
the Hindu population in Kerala followed by Chhattisgarh (990) and
Pondicherry (987). Kerala is again at the top (1082) followed by Pondicherry
(1097), and Tamil Nadu (1020) among the Muslims. It may be noted that
13 states and union territories recorded a sex ratio of over 1000 among
the Christians. Goa has returned the highest sex ratio of 1107 among the
Christians followed by Pondicherry and Delhi. Delhi has returned the
highest sex ratio among Sikh population (925) followed by Chandigarh
(910). Punjab having the maximum Sikh population has a low sex ratio of
897. In other states and union territories also, the sex ratio among the Sikh
population is below 900. Chhattisgarh has the highest sex ratio among the
Buddhists at 1012 followed by West Bengal (981). Maharashtra and Jammu
and Kashmir reporting substantial Buddhist population have a sex ratio of
961 and 941, respectively. Majority of the states (20) and union territories
returned the sex ratio of less than 900 among the Buddhist population.
Among the major states, Kerala has returned the highest sex ratio of 996
for Jains. In Gujarat and Rajasthan also, the sex ratio of Jains is high at 969
and 960, respectively. In 20 states, Iain population has a sex ratio between
901 and 950 While this pattern is seen in 10 states for the Hindus and 12
for the Muslims.
</p>

<p>
Sex Ratio in the Age Group 0—6 (Number of Female Children to the
Male Children in Age Group 0—6)

An alarming fact that emerged in the 2001 Census is declining child sex ratio
in the age group 0—6 in many states and union territories. At the all- India
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000200">200</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:200
</h1>
<p>
level, the Sikh population has recorded the lowest child sex ratio of 786 at
the 2001 Census preceded by Jains at 870. Christians have reported the highest
child sex ratio of 964 followed by Muslims at 950 and Buddhists at 942.
Hindus have reported a child sex ratio of 925 that is slightly lower than the
national average of 927 for the total population. Persons professing ‘Other
Religions and Persuasions’ have recorded the highest child sex ratio of 976
at the national level. This pattern is also evident in majority of the states and
union territories.
</p>

<p>
Among the major states, Chhattisgarh has the highest value of child sex
ratio 975 while Haryana the lowest at 816 for the Hindu population. Hindus
child sex ratio in Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh,
Mizoram and Jammu & Kashmir is below 900. Among Muslims; Jammu
& Kashmir has the highest child sex ratio of 980 whereas Punjab has the
lowest at 879. Haryana has also reported Muslim child sex ratio of 895. As
regards Christians, in 20 states and union territories, the child sex ratio is
above 951. As opposed to this, in 27 states and union territories, the child
sex ratio of Sikh population is below 900. The picture is further depressing,
as in nine states and union territories including Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi
and Haryana, the child sex ratio is below 800 among Sikhs. Sixteen states
and union territories have a child sex ratio below 850 among Jains while
nine states and union territories fall in this range among Buddhists. Among
the major states having large Jain population, sex ratio in the age group 0—6
is low at 832 in Gujarat and 878 in Rajasthan and 906 in Madhya Pradesh.
Northern states of Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan have
reported child sex ratio among Buddhists below 900 while, in Jammu and
Kashmir it is 961. It may be seen that sex ratio in age group 0—6 is very
depressing in northern states for all the religions barring a few exceptions.
It would be pertinent to point out that due to small numbers (population),
ratios tend to fluctuate and show erratic patterns. The child sex ratio patterns
among the major religious communities in some of the states such as
Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat depict similar but pronounced bias against the
girl child irrespective of their religious affiliations.
</p>

<p>
There exists a relationship between female literacy rate and proportiOn
of child population in the age group 0—6 among various religious groups. The
variable child population can be assumed to be a reasonable proxy for fertility
levels for the recent period preceding the census. Generally, it has been
argued that in developing countries high female literacy rate usually has a
positive dampening effect on lowering fertility, other factors being constant.
Thus, there is a negative relationship between female literacy (a minimum
level of educational level) and fertility. The level of proportion of child population
in the age group 0—6 is not the same for each of the religious groups
for corresponding female literacy rate but is definitely showing a negative
relationship as female literacy rate increases for all the religious groups. This
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000201">201</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:201
</h1>
<p>
indeed is a positive sign and shows that irrespective of religious affiliations,
investments, creation of background environment and facilities that lead to
improving female literacy would prove beneficial in lowering fertility faster
and as a long-term stable solution.
</p>

<p>
Jain population clearly demonstrated that high female literacy is a significant
contributing factor. On the other hand, Muslim population has higher
proportion of children aged between 0—6 years (18.7 per cent). This is clearly
reflected in the overall lower female literacy rate among Muslim women and
possibly of its improvement in recent years. The past legacy of low female
Muslim literacy, which is to some extent true even for segments of the Hindu
population, such as the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes among
them, has possibly had a (negative) role to play in not accelerating the pace
of fertility decline. It is, therefore, imperative that governments invest in
improving the overall female literacy, particularly for Muslims and sections
of Hindu society. These communities in turn need to respond positively and
faster than ever before and remove, if there exists any, female bias in educating
their women, both girls and adolescents. This is one definite proactive
step to improve the status of women in India by empowering them across
the religious group in the long run. The trends on the relationship between
female literacy and proportions of child population aged 0—6 are clearly Visible
and discernible from the 2001 Census data on religion. It is sensible
for the policy makers and planners to examine such issues in greater depth.
Among the larger states, Tamil Nadu has a distinct and secular fertility pattern
as none of the religious communities are having more than 13 per cent
population in the age group 0—6 years and the range varies from the lowest
10.4 per cent among Sikhs to 12.9 per cent in Muslims. Thus, the message
and practice of fertility limitation is widely dispersed and proportion of
child population has permeated to all religious communities.
</p>


<p>
PARSI POPULATION IN INDIA—THE WRITING ON THE WALL
"SIGNS OF DEFINITE DECLINE"

The Parsi population deserves an exceptional but definite mention and place
in this volume due to their very small numbers not only in India but also
in the world. As per the 2001 Census, the Parsi population in the country
is 69,601 (33,949 males and 35,652 females) as against their population of
76,382 (37,736 males and 38,646 females) in the 1991 Census. This is a clear,
visible but extremely unfortunate decline of a rich civilization of Zoroastrians
and its people. It is apparent from the 2001 Census results that urgent and
drastic interventions are required by all concerned including possibly by the
government and definitely the Parsi community leaders to ensure survival of
Parsi population in India. Fertility improvement innovative initiatives rather

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000202">202</pagenum>

<p>
than fertility control measures adopted by the community so far are possibly
the need of the hour before it reaches a point of no return. It is expected that
this loud and clear message from the 2001 Census results awakens the country
and the Parsi community from the deep slumber it is possibly in and have
a beneficial effect for them.
</p>

<p>
The Census of India 2001 reCorded the Parsi population at 69,601 with
an overall decline of 6781 persons or 8.9 per cent Over the 1991 Census figures.
It is distressing and disturbing to see that the community which has
excelled for so long, practically in all fields, social and economic among others,
continues to register sharp declines in its absolute population and the
dark clouds are threatening its fading away into history.
</p>

<p>
The absolute decline in Parsi population registered at the Census 2001
is both upsetting and alarming. It is unbelievable that a great and progressive
community as the Parsis is facing a serious prospect of fading away
from the canvass of the Indian communities. It is alarming because, it is
not a sudden epidemic or natural catastrophe which is the root cause of this
phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
About half a century ago, the prescription suggested, which unfortunately
remained unheeded, is as follows: For the Parsi population to maintain
its strength, its reproductive rate must be increased by about 20 per
cent; where five children are now born, the number will have to be increased
to six. During the last few decades, the average Parsi has found his income
increasingly insufficient to meet his standard of living. As a natural corollary,
the age at marriage has increased and the family Size decreased. In these circumstances,
if an increase in the birth rate without a corresponding increase
in the family income will prove detrimental to the health of the community
and loWer the expectation of life. The future survival of the community in
such a scenario appears to be bleak at the moment unless something dramatic
happens and the community is able to come out of this tail spin of a
shooting star. However, this wakeup call of grave concern may possibly alter
the situation for good before the community decides to pass a final judgment
for itself with or without the intervention of Others in the civil society.
</p>

<p>
Literacy and education are reasonably good indicators of development in
a society. Spread and diffusion of literacy is generally associated with essential
qualities of today’s civilization such as modernization, urbanization,
industrialization, communication and commerce. It forms an important
input in the overall development of individuals enabling them to comprehend
their social, political and cultural environment better and respond to it
appropriately. Higher levels of education lead to a greater awareness and also
contribute in improving economic conditions. It acts as a catalyst for social
upliftment enhancing the returns on investments amidst almost every aspect
of development effort, whether it is health, hygiene, population control and
environmental degradation control, empowerment of women and weaker

<p>
sections of the society. Improved levels of literacy also are prerequisite for
acquiring various skills.
 </p>

<p>
Literacy is one of the important social characteristics on which information
is obtained from every individual in the census. For the purpose of the
census, a person aged 7 and above, who can both read and write with understanding
in language, is treated as literate. A person who can only read but
cannot write is not literate. In the censuses prior to 1991, children below 5
years of age were necessarily treated as illiterates.
 </p>


<p>
The ability to read and write with understanding is not ordinarily
achieved until one had some schooling or at least some time to develop these
skills. It was, therefore, decided in the 1991 Census that all children in the
age group 0—6 will be treated as illiterates by definition and the population
aged 7 years and above only is to be classified as literates or illiterates. The
same criterion has been retained in the Census of India, 2001, also. It is not
mandatory that to be treated as literate, a person should have received any
formal education or acquired any minimum educational standard. Literacy
status can be acquired through adult literacy classes or by attending any non formal
educational system. Persons who are unfortunately blind and read in
Braille are also treated as literates.
 </p>

<p>
In Censuses up to 1981, it was customary to work out the literacy rate
taking into account the total population. Since literacy rate is more meaningful
if the subpopulation in the age group 0—6 is excluded from the total
population, it was decided in 1991 to use the term literacy rate for the population
in the age group of 7 years and above. The same concept is continued.
The literacy rate taking into account the total population in the denominator
is termed ‘crude literacy rate’.
 </p>

<p>
It is important to take note of the changes in absolute numbers to
observe their impact on the literacy trends in the country from the number
of literates and illiterates among the population aged seven years for India
from the 1991 and 2001 censuses. Of the 836,650,839 population recorded
for the country at the Census of India 1991, as many as 686,569,914 persons
were aged 7 years and above. Out of these, 358,402,626 were literates and
328,167,288 were illiterates. At the Census of India 2001, out of the provisional
total population of 1,014,651,658, the number of persons aged 7
years and above is 858,219,615. Out of these, 562,010,743 are literates and
296,208,952 are illiterates. There is an increase of 171,649,781 persons in
the age group of 7 years and above during 1991—2001, while 203,608,117
additional persons became literates during the decade. The significant milestone
reached in the Census of India, 2001 is that the total number of illiterates
has come down from 328,167,288 in 1991 to 296,208,952. Thus, for the
first time since independence, there is a decline in the absolute number of
illiterates during a decade. This is a major shift in improving literacy status
in India.

BIRTH RATES IN INDIA

India is the largest democracy in the world. It accounts for more than 16 per
cent of the world’s population around mid- 1998. This 16 per cent lives on less
than 2.5 per cent of the total land area of the planet Earth. Between 1995 and
2000, the population of the world is estimated to increase at the rate of 1.33
per cent per year, adding an average of 78 million persons each year. More
than one- fifth of this increase is estimated to be accounted by the increase in
population in India and this contribution is the largest, even larger than the
contribution of China, the most populous country in the world. Projections
prepared by the United Nations suggest that by the year 2050, population of
India will increase to 1529 million which will account for more than 17 per

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000208">208</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
	cent of the estimated world population of 8909 million. This means that of the
projected 2854 million increases in world population in the 50 years between
2000 and 2050, 515 million or more than 18 per cent will be confined to India
alone. These projections also indicate that by the year 2050, India will become
the most populous country in the world, surpassing China. Since nearly one- fifth
of the population increase in the world during the next 50 years will take
place in India, population stabilization in the world as a whole will depend on
the pace of demographic transition in India.
 </p>

<p>
The annual count of births in India over the last few years has shown a slowdown
in the decline of the birth rate of the world’s second most populous
country. It has been stated that the Vital rates from the country’s Sample
Registration System confirm what has recently been suspected: Fertility
decline has reached a classic ‘plateau’, with the downturn coming to an end,
at least for now. The pace of fertility decline has slowed, as is evident in the
large northern states, and for major states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan
and West Bengal among others. There is a fear that if the fertility decline
does not resume, the large states could grow even more rapidly, gaining an
increasing share of the national population. In that event, fertility could even
rise, a possibility that is rarely considered.
 </p>

<p>
Experts maintain that in a country with 1.1 billion people, the birth rates
at the state level are particularly important given the wide variations among
the populous northern states and the effect those states have on the national
rate.
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000209">209</pagenum>

<p>
India recognized that the problem of rapid population growth would
become a serious national issue as early as in 1955, and has the world’s oldest
population policy. At that time, women in India averaged about six lifetime
births. With mortality rates falling, particularly maternal and infant rates,
India’s population, which was about 350 milliOn at Independence in 1948,
was growing at an ever increasing rate.
</p>

<p>
Since adopting the population policy, the country’s fertility has fallen
in fits and starts. By 2000, women Were having an average of about 3.3 children.
As has often been observed, a good part of the national fertility decline
occurred in the southern states, which generally have higher rates of literacy
and education, along with greater equality for women. For example, in Tamil
Nadu, birth rates have declined to about two children per Woman.
</p>

<p>
It is agreed that future fertility decline in India must come from the large
and highly illiterate northern states in the so- called ‘Hindi belt’. The birth
rates for Uttar Pradesh (population of 175 million at the 2001 Census), Bihar
(110 million), and Madhya Pradesh (81 million), along with Gujarat (51 million),
are shown as representative examples. Here, the slowdown in fertility
decline is evident, and a similar conclusion could be reached for major states
such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal, among others.
</p>

<p>
India’s National Population Policy 2000 calls for the country’s fertility to
reach the ‘replacement level’ of about 2.1 children by 2010, so that population
growth would eventually reach zero. This calls for an accelerated fertility
decline in the high- fertility states of the north.
</p>

Advantages of the Study of Population Composition

In addition to studying the changes in population characteristics or attributes
over a period of time, a study of population structure and its composition
also takes into consideration the distribution of these attributes and
their comparisons at a point of time. To study the structure and characteristics
of any population is not enough. It is necessary to seek explanations for
any changes that may have occurred and Visualize the consequences of these
changes. To probe further, investigating the reasons for any change in the
composition of population will lead to its demographic, social and economic
consequences.

. The study of population composition helps in an elaborate study of
any population and thus makes comparisons possible.

. The data on population composition is useful in the preparation of
inventories of human resources, so necessary for effective developmental
planning.

. When reliable information on births and deaths is not available from
the civil registration system, it may be obtained by utilizing the data

</p>

<p>
on the age— sex distribution of population attributes that provide
material for the study of the social and economic structure of the
population and the changes in this structure, if any.
  </p>

<p>
S U M M A R Y

. The composition of population is one of the interesting and significant
aspects of social demography and it provides information about
different kinds of people that are found in any given population and
the differences that exist among the different groups.

. The characteristics or attributes that are incorporated in the study of
the composition of the population are classified into two groups: (i)
ascribed characteristics and (ii) achieved characteristics.

. Ascribed characteristics are biological or culturally assigned and the
achieved characteristics reflect the social status, prestige and the ability
of an individual to acquire an established position in the society as
a result of individual accomplishments.

. Sex and age are the basic characteristics or the biological attributes
of any demographic group and these influence not only the demographic
group but also social, economic and political structure of any
country.

. The sex ratio stands at 933 to India as a whole, as per the Census of
India, 2001. It is a minor improvement, compared to the 1991 Census,
which had 927 females for every 1000 males. Many demographers
believe that left on its own, this is an unalterable constant and creates
an uneven social imbalance.

. Ageing is the most significant outcome of the process known as
demographic transition and India is undergoing such a demographic
transition.

. The urban— rural distribution of the people indicates the growth of
urbanization. It increased from about 11—17 per 1000 during 1901—
2001. The levels of urbanization were low at the beginning of the
twentieth century and there is not much change in the beginning of
the twenty— first century.


. The economic and social development of a nation depends on the
number of economically active persons, the quality of their Work and
the regularity of their employment, i.e., the occupational structure.

. Employed are classified into main worker, marginal worker, and non worker
and the workers are classified into four categories: (i) cultiva-

<p>
tor, (ii) agricultural labourer, (iii) worker in household industry, and
(iv) other workers, those who are engaged in some economic activity
during the last one year but were not cultivators or agricultural
labourers or engaged in household industry.

. In percentage terms between 1991 and 2001, the population increased
by 21.2 per cent and the workers by 27.2 per cent. While the net addition
of male population between 1991 and 2001 was to the order of
91 million (20.8 per cent) the net addition of male workers Was 49
million, registering an increase of 21.8 per cent. It is remarkable to
note that the percentage increase in the female workers between 1991
and 2001 was 40.6 per cent when the female population during the
corresponding period increased by 21.7 per cent.

. From its inception, the Census Reports of India contained. information
about the religious affiliation as expressed by the people of India.
Religion being one of the basic socio-cultural characteristics of any
society, due emphasis and care is taken while collecting information
with regard to the followers of various religions including the minor
religious beliefs, faiths and persuasions. The information collected
through census questionnaire is tabulated and presented in the form
of religion tables.

. In the Census of India 2001, as in the previous censuses, the information
relating to this important characteristic of all individuals Was .
collected as reported by them and the individual responses to the
question on religion were recorded in the Household Schedule only
for each member independently.

. Some of the key findings from the Census reports are: (i) Population
of religious groups, their distribution and growth rate, (ii) Sex ratio
of population (number of females per thousand males), and (iii) Sex
ratio in the age group 0- 6 (number of female children to the male
children in age group 0-6). One of the alarming facts that emerged
from the 2001 Census is declining child sex ratio in the age group 0— 6
in many states and union territories.

. The Census of India 2001 recOrded the Parsi population at 69,601
with an overall decline of 6781 persons or 8.9 per cent over the 1991
Census figures. It is distressing and disturbing to see that the community,
which has excelled fer so long, practically in all fields, including
social and economic, continues to register sharp declines in its absolute
population.

. Literacy is one of the important social characteristics on which information
is obtained of every individual in the census. For the purposes
of census, a person aged 7 and above, who can both read and write

  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000212">212</pagenum>

Page no:212
</h1>
<p>
  with an understanding in language, is treated as literate. A person
who can only read but cannOt write is nOt literate. In the censuses
prior to 1991, children below 5 years of age Were necessarily treated
as illiterates.

. There is an increase of 171,649,781 persons in the age group of 7years
and above during 1991-2001, while 203,608,117 additional persons
became literates during the decade. The significant milestone reached
in the Census of India 2001 is that the total number of illiterates has
come down from 328,167,288 in 1991 to 296,208,952, in 2001. Thus,
for the first time since independence, there is a decline in the absolute
number of illiterates during a decade.

. Literacy rates for persons, males and females at the Census of India,
2001 by states and union territories present the trends in literacy.
Kerala with a literacy rate of 90.92 per cent holds the first rank in
the country, closely followed by Mizoram (88.49 per cent) and
Lakshadweep (87.52 per cent).

. The study of population composition is crucial for the development
of any nation.

INTRODUCTION

Increased density of population creates problems that transcend national
boundaries. Accordingly, regulation of population growth Within nations is
a proper subject for ‘policy formulation’ by governments across the globe.
In recent years, the poor regions of the earth have been swept by a ‘popula-
tion revolution’. Though it has attracted comparatively little attention, it is
nevertheless both unprecedented and likely to have serious repercusSions
in future. Ironically, this revolution is ‘policy-triggered’, and is brewing in
the corridors of the government. Among other diverse countries like Africa,
Asia, and Latin America, a single idea has rapidly gained currency: a modern
government should have a population ‘policy’— an array of laws and
measures, specifically aimed at shaping the composition, size, and rate of
change of the national population.
 </p>

<p>
	In the Third World, the Indian government was the first to endorse the
principle of an active ‘population policy’. It took the first step towards population
-Control measures in December 1952, with the adoption of its First Five- Year
Plan. The Plan was a document which included a long- run governmental
objective of directing the country’s population towards ‘a level consistent with
the requirements of the national economy’. By the mid— 1980s, over 30 governments
in the less developed regions of the world followed suit. This group
included the governments of six of the world’s ten most populous countries.
By the late 1980s, more than 70 of the world’s governments reported that they
viewed their national ‘fertility’ or ‘population growth rates’ as ‘unsatisfactory’.
They considered policy interventions to alter these rates to ‘appropriate’.
</p>

<p>
The adoption of comprehensive ‘population policy’ marks an eventful
change in the conception of the role of government in civic life. In the past,
governments were often called upon to perform their duties with demonstrable
demographic consequences— the regulation of immigration, for
example, or the eradication of communicable disease. The demographic
impact of such programmes, however, was typically subsidiary to their primary
objective of preServation of national sovereignty, the promotion of
public health, etc.
</p>

<p>
POPULATION POLICY: ISSUES AND CONCEPTS

There is a need to improve the understanding of interaction of social, economic,
cultural, political and environmental conditions with demographic and
health trends. It is important to study its contribution in formulating effective
population, health, and development policies and programmes. For better or
worse, global population is increasing by about 1.5 per cent per year, a growth
rate that in less than half a century will double the number of people who
live on the planet. There is unanimity in identifying an inverse relationship
between disproportionate growth rate of population and economic development.
It is very difficult to achieve stable economic development, as growing
population negates the fruits of new development.
</p>

<p>
Concept of ‘Population Policy’

Population policy is a comprehensive term, which includes all efforts used
by any government to control and change the existing population structure.
The UNESCO Population Commission Report of the Adhoc Consultative
Group of Experts of Population Policy includes measures and programmes
which help in achieving economic, social, demographic, political and other
collective goals through critical demographic variables, such as size, growth
and distribution of population.

</p>

<p>
Gunar Myrdal defined a population policy as a social policy at large.
He stated that a population programme must fit itself into the Whole fabric
of social life. It includes programmes and policies related to increase or
decrease of death and birth rates, increase in population growth rate, distribution
of population and So on. According to Spengler, a population policy
covers all such population problems that influence either distribution or
quality of population.
</p>

<p>
A population policy can be either explicit or implicit. Under an explicit
policy, problems influencing demographic characteristics or processes are
directly tackled and solved. In an implicit policy, population problems are
solved under economic, social or political policy. Population policy can also
be formulated bearing in mind immediate as well as long-term objectives.
Objectives of a population policy can be quantitative, qualitative as well as
spatial. According to Frank Ntoestein, the main objective of population policy
today is to ensure that there is a reasonable gap between the fall of death
rates and birth rates.
</p>

<p>
Paul Meadows has said that national population policy should have
norms as well as methodology. The norms should be that the birth of children
should be well planned. The birth and number of children should be
optional. Children should be planned in such a way that parents can ensure
proper education and maintain good health for them. Such norms should
help in keeping population at a reasonable level. In methodology, he suggests
that there should be improvement in production, increased availability of
food supplies, sufficient storage of food, late marriages and certain restrictions
on producing more children.
</p>

<p>
The field of population studies looks into the impact of population
changes on the social and economic development of both rich and poor
societies. To a certain extent, modern governance is predicated on the idea
that national directorates can and should act to improve the material well being
of their subjects. An understanding of the specific economic and social
consequences of population change has been developed. Hence, a growing
number of governments have seen merit in the prospect of shaping the
demographic contours of their country so that national welfare and social
prosperity might be ‘scientifically’ advanced. In other words, governments
are making efforts to control growth rate of their populations in order to
optimize the positive consequences of growth and development.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for all involved, contemporary population policies have
in large part been promoted and adopted on the basis of a serious misconception.
The relationship between ‘population change’ and ‘economic development’
is as yet rather poorly understood. For many, the relationships
between the two are at best highly tentative. Still others are characterized by
false precision or misplaced specificity. And despite the authority that population
‘scientists’ today lend to the worldwide effort to promote birth control,
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000216">216</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 216
</h1>
<p>
evidence proves that voluntary ‘family planning’ programmes resulting in
sustained changes in ‘fertility norms’ is to an extent still a myth. None of this
augurs well for the populations upon which far- reaching and purportedly
scientific population policies are to be applied.
</p>

<p>
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF POPULATION POLICY

Viewed along the lines of historical necessity, population policies are aimed
at drawing attention to the relation between exploding population numbers
and poverty, pollution, illiteracy, unemployment, resource- conflict,
etc. Population policies are deliberately constructed or modified institutional
arrangements or specific programmes through Which governments
influence, directly or indirectly, demographic change. For any given country,
the aim of population policy may be narrowly interpreted as bringing
about quantitative changes in the membership of the territorially delimited
population under the government’s jurisdiction. Governments’ concern
with population matters can also extend beyond the borders of their own
jurisdictions. Thus, international aspects of population policy have become
increasingly salient in the contemporary world.
</p>

<p>
Additions to the population are primarily the result of individual
decisions concerning ‘childbearing’. Within the constraints of their social
milieu, these decisions reflect an implicit calculus (weighing of pros and
cons) by parents about the private ‘costs’ and ‘benefits’ of children. But, neither
costs nor benefits of fertility are likely to be restricted only to the family;
they can also impose burdens and advantages on others in the society.
Such externalities, negative and positive, represent a legitimate concern for
all those affected.
</p>

<p>
The, generality of the definition lends itself to varying interpretations. For
any given country, the aim of population policy may be narrowly interpreted
as bringing about quantitative changes in the membership of the territorially
delimited population under the government’s jurisdiction. Additions
to membership are affected only through ‘births’ and ‘immigration’, losses
are caused by emigration and by deaths. Concern with this last component
is usually seen as a matter for health policy, leaving fertility and migration
as the key objects of governmental interest in population policy. More
broadly, policy intent may also aim at modification of qualitative aspects
of these phenomena— fertility and international migration —including
the composition of the population by various demographic characteristics
and the population’s spatial distribution. Furthermore, governments’ concern
with population matters can also extend beyond the borders of their
own jurisdictions. International aspects of population policy have become
increasingly salient in the contemporary world. .

<p>
HISTORICITY OF POPULATION POLICY

Rulers of any political unit have a stake in the size and composition of
the population over which they have authority, hence an incentive to try
to influence demographic change in a desired direction. Thus, ‘population
policy’ may be said to have a long history, starting at least with the empires
of the ancient world. Greater numbers tended to connote greater wealth and
power, at least for those at the apex of the social pyramid. Measures encouraging
marriage and sometimes immigration testify to the prevailing populationist
sentiment among rulers throughout history. But, the control of the
premodern state over fertility in traditional societies was limited. The dominant
influence setting the patterns of reproduction was located in a deeper
layer of social interaction. In the premodern societies, fertility, an important
element affecting population change, was a social rather than an individual
issue. All societies, if at varying degrees, grant a measure of self- sovereignty
to their members. Individuals have certain rights over their directions in life.
But, this is always subject to some constraints, not only biological but also
social. Well before rights and obligations are formally codified in legal terms,
they are established through spontaneous social interaction.
</p>

<p>
Restrictions on freedom take the form of social expectations and
pressures that indiViduals can ignore only at considerable personal costs.
Typically, there is a strong expectation that men and women should marry
and have children. Parental and kin obligations in the matter of bringing up
children are well understood by all adults and are informally enforced by
the community. In most of the societies, marriage is considered a social and
legal sanction for procreation. It is understood that children are to be born to
married couples only; that a man can have one wife at a time; that a husband
is obligated to support his wife and children; and that he can expect reciprocal
services from them. Informal rules shaped by community interest tend
effectively to regulate the entry of foreigners. The fabric of such demographically
relevant behavioural stances, supported by internalized personal norms
and buttressed by religious injunctions, is a product of social evolution; ‘how
effective such institutions are’ becomes an important determinant of societal
success. As the British demographer Alexander Carr Saunders states,
‘that persons and groups of persons are naturally selected on account of the
customs they practice, just as they are selected on account of their mental
and physical characters. Those groups practising the most advantageous
customs will have an advantage in the constant struggle between adjacent
groups over those that practice less advantageous customs. Few customs can
be more advantageous than those whiCh limit the number of a group to the
desirable number. . .. [In the traditional society] there would grow up an idea
that it was the right thing to bring up a certain limited number of children,
and the limitation of the family would be enforced by convention.’
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000218">218</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
Given the harsh biological and economic constraints premodern societies
invariably experienced, that ‘desirable number’ took for granted fairly high
fertility, high enough to provide a sufficient margin of safety over mortality
(since death or mortality rates were high, birth or fertility rates were also
high, in order to compensate for the losses through mortality). Successful
soCieties —societies that survived to the dawn of the modern era —obeyed
the biblical injunction to be fruitful and multiply. This multiplication was
necessarily very slow. But, traditional demographic regimes resulting from
spontaneous social interaction achieved modest growth rates at varying levels
of fertility and mortality. Early modern Western Europe succeeded in
maintaining a relatively low average level of mortality by means of keeping
birth rates low, primarily by means of a fairly high average age of marriage
and substantial proportions that remained permanently single. A contrasting
pattern, in India, early and universal marriage resulted in a high level
of fertility, but the population growth was slow due to high death rates that
balanced the level of the birth rate. With respect to the rate of population
growth, these different combinations of birth and death rates in traditional
societies were very similar. The potential for rapid population growth that
might be triggered by a fall of mortality was, however, much higher when the
‘premodern equilibrium’ was the result of a combination of high ‘mortality’
and high ‘fertility’ (the earlier stage of demographic transition).
</p>

<p>
The earliest clear formulation of the population problem as a problem
of coordination among individual preferences leading to a potential state
intervention in the matter of fertility was given by William Foster Lloyd, an
Oxford mathematician and economist, in an essay published in 1833. In the
spirit of the Malthusian concerns of his time, Lloyd envisaged the possibility
of overpopulation even under conditions when all families have only the children
they actually want. He suggested the direction in which remedy ought
to be sought. The simple fact of a country being overpopulous is not, of itself,
sufficient evidence that the fault lies in the people themselves, or a proof of
the absence of a prudential disposition. The fault may rest, not with them as
individuals, but with the constitution of the society, of which they form a part.
Population policy should therefore strive towards institutions and incentive
systems —a constitution of the society —that provides the signals to individuals
guiding them to behave in harmony with the collective interest.
</p>

<p>
FIVE-YEAR PLANS AND POPULATION POLICY

India, the second most populous country in the world having a meagre
2.4 per cent of the world’s surface area sustains 16.7 per cent of the world’s
population. Realizing the inevitable high population growth during the initial
phases of demographic transition and the need to accelerate the pace

</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000219">219</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 219
</h1>
<p>
of the transition, India became the first country in the world to formulate a
National Family Planning Programme in 1952, with the objective of ‘reducing
birth rate to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at a level
consistent with requirement of national economy’. The First Five- Year Plan
stated ‘The main appeal for family planning is based on considerations of
health and welfare of the family. Family limitation or spacing of children is
necessary and desirable in order to secure better health for the mother and
better care and upbringing of children. Measures directed to this end should,
therefore, form part of the public health program.’ Thus, the key elements of
health care to women and children and provision of contraceptive services
have been the focus of India’s family planning and population policies right
from the time of independence. Successive Five- Year Plans have provided
the policy framework and funding towards this goal. People were educated
about the advantages of small family and the methods to achieve it. New initiatives
were taken and policies were framed based on the studies conducted
at regular intervals on the population growth.
 </p>

<p>
First Five-Year Plan (1 951 -56)

The planners agreed that there was a considerable need and necessity for population
control in India. They felt that first of all the people should be made
to realize the need and necessity of controlling population. Towards this goal,
they felt the need of scientific analysis of causes of increasing population in
the country and also the methods to be used to control births. Then their
other aim was as to make the Indian masses realize the necessity of the programme,
to anticipate the likely hindrances and the appropriate methods to
overcome these. The planners also desired that family planning programme
should be made an integral part of the health services and that in the hospitals,
doctors should be persuaded to convince the couples of reproductive
age to adopt the programme. The people should be educated in a manner
which is suited to educational level of the masses. In order to implement these
ideas in 1953, the Family Planning Research and Programme Committee
was set up. A year later in 1954, the Family Planning Grants Commission
was set up. During the First Plan, a provision was made for an expenditure of
Rs 65 lakh out of which 14.51 lakh was actually utilized, i.e., 77.7 per cent
remained unutilised. In fact, the states did not show much interest in
the implementation of the programme. During the period under review,
147 family planning Clinics were opened, out of which only 21 were in the rural
areas. In addition to this, 205 privately run clinics were financially assisted.
 </p>

<p>
Second Five-Year Plan (1956——60)

The Family Planning Programme was a modest programme during the
Second Five— Year Plan; but this time somewhat more importance was

  </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000220">220</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 220
</h1>
<p>
attached to it. This now became an action—cum-research-oriented programme
and the following were decided:

i. Family planning facilities and advices should be made easily available.

ii. More facilities to be provided to the workers engaged in the
	programme.

iii. People should be educated about aspects of birth, death, etc.

iv. Research should be carried about aspects of birth, death, etc.

v. The centres which are financially assisted should be regularly
   inspected.

vi. Every town having a population of 50,000 or above should have at
	least one family planning clinic.
</p>

<p>
During the plan period, Rs 5 crore was earmarked for the purpose. It was also
proposed to open clinics in 3000 urban and 2000 rural areas. An independent
Family Planning Board was set up and Rs 2.156 crore was spent and thus only
43.2 per cent of the total earmarked expenditure could be utilized. Family
planning facilities were provided in 330 urban and 1864 rural health centres.
By the end of the Plan, each state had at least one family planning unit.
</p>

<p>
Third Five-Year Plan (1961—65)

During the Second Five-Year Plan, Government took steps for propagation
of the Family Planning Programme. Large— scale posters were distributed.
Family planning films were exhibited all over the country. Voluntary associations
were given liberal financial assistance and social workers were encouraged
to participate in the programme. In fact, the society paid considerable
attention to the entire Family Planning Programme. By a law, the lowest age
of marriage of a girl was fixed at 15 years and education also considerably
spread. With the help of mass media, message of family planning was sent
to every village. Health and family planning centres became useful information
centres for the whole programme. But, when the position was reviewed
after the census of 1961, it became amply clear that population had increased
at a much faster rate than what was expected. Therefore, during the Third
Plan, serious attention was paid to the whole programme. Now, extensive
approach was adopted and following were decided to be followed:

i. More propaganda for Family Planning Programme should be carried
out and people should be educated more in this regard.

ii. In the urban areas, 2100 and in rural areas, 6100 clinics should be
opened.

iii. Para—medical personnel should be given intensive training.

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000221">221</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 221
</h1>
<p>
iv. The people working outside the public sector should also be provided
with facilities for technical training for making the programme of
family planning a success.

v. Family planning material production should be increased.

vi. In every clinic, material and workers for family planning be made
easily available.

vii. Female education should be encouraged so that women become quite
conscious of the significance of the programme.

viii. There should be research in the fields of development of studies
of human genetics and studies in the physiology of reproduction.
Development of more effective local contraceptives, development of
a suitable oral contraceptive and follow-up of sterilization cases, both
in males and females, to investigate possible aftereffects should be
encouraged.
 </p>

<p>
To begin with, a sum of Rs 50 crore was allotted for the programme which
was subsequently reduced to Rs 27 crore. Actual expenditure, however, was
Rs 24. 36 crore. During the plan period, in every state a family planning
bureau was opened. By the close of the plan, 4840 rural, 21, 752 semi- -rural
and 1856 urban centres were at work.
 </p>

<p>
Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-73)

With the passage of time, more and more need and necessity of Family
Planning Program was being realized, with the result that in the Fourth Five-
Year Plan, the programme was given top priority. The planners wanted to
bring down the birth rate to 25 per 1000 and that at least 90 per cent couples
in the reproductive age should use one or other method of family control.
Under the plan outlay, Rs 302 crore was provided for the programme, out
of which, Rs 75 crore was provided for research, training and propaganda.
Some of the important guiding principles of the plan were as follows:

i. There will be extensive propaganda for family planning and mass
media will be extensively used for the purpose.

ii. Family planning material will be distributed through 6 lakh centres.

iii. By 1973— 74, birth rate will be brought down to 32 per 1000 and by
that period, the use of contraceptives, oral pills, etc. Will be made
widespread by four times.

iv. Women to whom IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device) do not
suit will be provided pills for daily use.

v. Material of operations will be provided to 7000 clinics and 1000
mobile vans will also be commissioned into service.

 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000222">222</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 222
</h1>
<p>
vi. Training will be provided to 1000 medical and 1,50,000 para-medical
personnel.

vii. Family planning centres will be responsible for after delivery care.
 </p>

<p>
As the programme progressed, it became clear that family planning material
was being used by only those who were already of advance age and already
had three or four children. It was also seen that this material was being extensively
used by literate rather than illiterate women. It was estimated that 22.8
per cent of the estimated total of 11 crore eligible couples of reproductive age
group were covered by the programme and by March 1979 as many 343 lakh
births had been averted.
 </p>

<p>
  It was increasingly felt by the Government that the Family Planning
Programme in India could not be a success unless the workers were properly
trained. It was, therefore, decided that family welfare workers should be
multipurpose workers. The programme was started in the states of Andhra
Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Uttar
Pradesh. Seven training institutes were set up for the purpose, which train
district level officers, medical officers and others. Under this scheme, up to
1974—75, almost 3000 people received training. During 1977—78, thousands
of personnel in 60 districts were trained and multipurpose services were
provided in 88 districts. During 1980—81, a large number of personnel were
trained in 123 more districts.
 </p>

<p>
India is a vast country in which people of reproductive age group are
spread both in the villages and cities. It is estimated that at any point of
time, there were about 13.5 crore couples in reproductive age group. The
programme of family planning in India could be successful only when the
people were properly educated and motivated. Mass media, song, drama
and extension education are the methods through which the people were
approached and educated for Family Planning Programme. For promoting
the programme, co—operation of trade unions, co-operatives, Panchayats
and other local institutions was also sought. Department of Family Planning
also distributed very good printed material for the consumption of masses,
both in the urban as well as rural areas.
 </p>

<p>
Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974-79)

Under the Fifth Five-Year Plan, about Rs 560 crore was earmarked for the
Family Planning Programme. Some of the important features of the programme
during this period were as follows:

i. The programme was run along with other health programmes in the
   hospital.

ii. Co—operation of the local leaders and other influential persons was
 	sought.

 </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000223">223</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>

iii. Essential material Connected with family planning was supplied.

iv. Workers were given adequate training.

V. Adequate attention was paid to healths of child and mother.

vi. Urban family planning centres were setup and mobile vans were
maintained.
 </p>

<p>
Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980—85)

During the Sixth Five—Year, Rs 10,000 million was earmarked for the Family
Planning Programme. The aim was to reduce the net reproductive rate
and to bring down average family size to 2—3 children from the existing
2-4 children. The birth rate per thousand was brought down from 33 to 21
and death rate from 14 per cent to 9.60 per cent of the eligible couples who
were brought under family planning.
 </p>

<p>
Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985—90)

In the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the outlay for the family welfare and population
programmes was fixed at Rs 3256 crore. The targets fixed being effective
couple protection rate 42 per cent; crude birth rate 29.1 per cent, crude death
rate 10.4 per cent and infant mortality rate (IMR) 90 per cent.
 </p>

<p>
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992—97)

To impart new dynamism to the Family Welfare Programme, several new
initiatives were introduced and ongoing schemes were revamped in the
Eighth Five-Year Plan. The broad features of these initiatives are discussed
in the following:
 </p>

<p>
The World Bank—assisted Area Projects which seek to upgrade infrastructure
and development of trained manpower have been set up during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Two new Area Projects namely India Population
Project (IPP) VIII and IX have been initiated during the Eighth Plan. The
IPP—VIII project aimed at improving health and family welfare services in
the urban slums in the cities of Delhi, Calcutta, Hyderabad and BangalOre.
IPP-IX operated in the states of Rajasthan, Assam and Karnataka.
 </p>

<p>
An USAID- assisted project named ‘Innovations in Family Planning
Services’ has been taken up in Uttar Pradesh with specific objective of reducing
TFR from 5.4 to 4 and increasing CPR from 35 per cent to 50 per cent
over the 10 years project period.
 </p>

<p>
Recognizing the fact that demographic and health profile of the country
is not uniform, 90 districts which have CBR of over 39 per 1000 (1991 census)
were identified for differential programming. Enhanced allocation of
financial resources, amounting to Rs 50 lakh per year per district, was made
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000224">224</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
for upgradation of health infrastructure in these districts from 1992—93 to
1995—96. This amount is being used for providing well-equipped operation
theatres, labour rooms, a six-bedded observation ward and residential quarters
for paramedical workers in five PHCs (primary health centres) of each
district per year. All the block level PHCs of these 90 districts have been
covered.
 </p>

<p>
Realizing that the propagation and motivation of the people by the
Government alone for adaptation of small family norm would not be sufficient,
greater stress has been laid on the involvement of NGOs to supplement
and complement the Government’s efforts. Four new schemes for increasing
the involvement of NGOs have been evolved by the Department of Family
Welfare.
 </p>

<p>
The target fixed for the Eighth Plan of a national level birth rate of 26 was
achieved by all states except the states of Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
 </p>

<p>
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997—2002)

The technological advances and improved quality and coverage of health
care resulted in a rapid fall in the crude death rate (CDR) from 25.1 in 1951
to 9.8 in 1991. In contrast, the reduction in the crude birth rate (CBR) has
been less steep, declining from 40.8 in 1951 to 29.5 in 1991. As a result, the
annual exponential population growth rate has been over 2 per cent in the
last three decades. During the Eighth Plan period, the decline in CBR has
been steeper than that in the CDR and consequently, the annual population
growth rate has been around 1.9 per cent during 1991—95. The rate of
decline in the population growth further accelerated during the Ninth Plan
period. Although there was a decline in CBR and CDR in all states, the rate
of decline in CBR was slower in some states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
There are substantial differences in CBR and IMR between states and even
within the same state, there are substantial differences between districts. The
efforts of the Family Welfare Programme during the Ninth Plan was to minimize
the existing disparities by providing resources to fill the crucial gaps
in infrastructure and manpower in primary health care in both urban and
rural areas, and to improve the operational efficiency Of the health system.
The emphasis on improving the access and quality of reproductive and child
health services enabled the increasingly aware and literate families to attain
their reproductive goals in harmony with the national goals.
 </p>

 <p>
Reduction in the population growth rate has been recognized as one of the
priority objectives during the Ninth Plan period. The high population growth
rate has been identified due to: (i) the large size of the population in the reproductive
age —group (estimated contribution 60 per cent); (ii) higher fertility
due to unmet need for contraception (estimated contribution 20 per cent);
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000225">225</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:225
</h1>
<p>
and (iii) high wanted fertility due to prevailing high IMR (estimated contribution
about 20 per cent).
 </p>

<p>
While the population growth contributed by the large population in the
reproductive age group recognized to continue in the foreseeable future, the
other two factors were given effective and prompt remedial action.

The following were the objectives during the Ninth Plan:

i. To meet all the felt- needs for contraception.

ii. To reduce the infant and maternal morbidity and mortality so that
there is a reduction in the desired level of fertility.
 </p>

<p>
The following were the strategies during the Ninth Plan:

i. To assess the needs for reproductive and child health at PHC level and
undertake area- specific micro planning.

ii. To provide need- based, demand— driven, high quality, integrated
reproductive and child health care.
 </p>

 <p>
In order to give a new thrust to efforts to achieve a more rapid decline
in the birth rate, death rate and the population growth rate, the National
Development Council (NDC) set up a Sub-committee on Population
(1992) and endorsed its recommendations in 1993. The Sub- committee
recommended that there should be a paradigm shift in the Family Welfare
Programme and the focus should be on the following:

. Decentralized area- specific planning based on need assessment.

. Emphasis on improved access and quality of services to women and
children.

. Providing special assistance to poorly performing states/ districts to
minimize the differences in performance.

. Creation of district- level databases on quality, coverage and impact
indicators for monitoring the programme.

. The International Conference on Population and Development
(ICPD) at Cairo in 1994 advocated a similar approach.

. A convergence between national (the NDC Sub-committee) and
international (ICPD) efforts improved funding of Family Welfare
Programme during the Ninth Plan period.
 </p>

<p>
During the Ninth Plan period, the Department of Family Welfare implemented
the recommendations of the NDC Sub-committee. Centrally defined
method- specific targets for family planning were abolished. The emphasis
shifted to decentralized planning at the district level, based on the assessment
of community needs and implementation of programmes aimed at fulfilment
of these needs. State- specific goals for process and impact parameters for
 </p>

</h1>
<p>
maternal and child health and contraceptive care were worked out and used
for monitoring progress. Efforts were made to improve the quality and content
of services through training to upgrade skills for all personnel and building up
a referral network. The Department of Family Welfare set up a consultative
committee to suggest appropriate restructuring of infrastructure funded by
the states and the centre and revise norms for re-imbursement by the centre
and has started implementing the recommendations of the Committee.
Monitoring and evaluation became a part of the programme and the data was
used for mid-course corrections. The Department has drawn up the National
Population Policy 2000 (NPP 2000), which aims at achieving replacement
level of fertility by 2010. A National Commission on Population was constituted
in May 2000, in line with the recommendations of the NPP 2000.
</p>

<p>
Some of the major areas of concern included:

i. The massive interstate differences in fertility and mortality; fertility
and mortality rates are high in the most populous states, where nearly
half the country’s population lives;

ii. Gaps in infrastructure, manpower and equipment, and mismatch
between infrastructure and manpower in primary health centres
(PHCs)/ community health centres (CHCs); lack of referral services;

iii. Slow decline in mortality during the 1990s; the goals set for mortality
and fertility in the Ninth Plan were not achieved;

iv. There has been no decline in the maternal mortality ratios (MMRs)
over the last three decades, while neonatal and infant mortality rates
have plateaued during the 1990s;

v. The routine service coverage has declined, perhaps because of the
emphasis on campaign mode operations for individual components
of the programme;

vi. In spite of the emphasis on training to improve skills for the delivery
of integrated reproductive and child health (RCH) services, the
progress in in-service training has been very slow and the anticipated
improvement in the content and quality of care has not taken place;

vii. Evaluation studies have shown that the coverage under immunization
is not universal even in the best performing states while coverage
rates are very low in states like Bihar; elimination of polio is yet to be
achieved; a

viii. The logistics of drug supply has improved in some states but remains
poor in populous states; and

ix. Decentralized district-based planning, monitoring and mid-course
correction utilizing the locally generated service data and Civil
Registration was not yet been operationalized.

<p>
Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002-07)

The pressing objective of the NPP 2000 is to address the unmet needs for
contraception, health care infrastructure and health personnel, and to provide
integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care.
The medium-term objective is to bring the TFR to replacement levels by
2010, through vigorous implementation of intersectoral operational strategies.
The long-term objective is to achieve a stable population by 2045, at
a level consistent with the requirements of sustainable economic growth,
social development and environmental protection.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of these objectives, the following national socio-demographic
goals to be achieved in each case by 2010 are formulated:

. Address the unmet needs for basic for reproductive and child health
services, supplies and infrastructure.

. Make school education up to age 14 free and reduce dropouts at primary
and secondary school levels to below 20 per cent for both boys
and girls.

. Decrease infant mortality.

. Diminish maternal mortality.

. Achieve universal immunization of children against all vaccine preventable
disease.

. Prop up delayed marriage for girls.

. Accomplish common access to information or counselling and services
for fertility regulation and contraception with wide basket
choices.

. Achieve 100 per cent registration of births, deaths, marriage and
pregnancy.

. Contain the spread of AIDS and promote greater integration
between the management of reproductive tract infections and
sexually transmitted infections and the National AIDS control
organization.

. Bring about convergence in implementation of related sector
programmes so that family welfare becomes a people— centred
programme.

If the National population policy 2000 is fully implemented, we foresee
a population of 1107 million (110 crore) in 2010, instead of 1162 million
(116 crore).

Population growth in India continues to be high on account of the
large size of the population in the reproductive age  —group (estimated

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000228">228</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
contribution 58 per cent). An addition of 417.2 million between 1991
and 2016 is anticipated despite substantial reductions in family size in
several states, including those which have already achieved replacement
levels of TFR. This momentum of increase in population will continue
for some more years because high TFRs in the past have resulted in a
large proportion of the population being currently in their reproductive
years. It is imperative that the reproductive age group adopts without
further delay or exception the ‘small family norm’, for the reason
that about 45 per cent of population increase is contributed by births
above two children per family.
</p>

<p>
Higher fertility due to unmet need for contraception (estimated contribution
20 per cent). India has 168 million eligible couples, of which just
44 per cent are currently effectively protected. Urgent steps are currently
required to make contraception more widely available, accessible and
affordable. Around 74 per cent of the population lives in rural areas, in
about 5.5 lakh villages, many with poor communications and transport.
Reproductive health and basic health infrastructure and services often
do not reach the villages, and, acCordingly, vast numbers of people cannot
avail of these services.
</p>

<p>
High wanted fertility due to the high infant mortality rate (IMR) (estimated
contribution about 20 per cent). Repeated child births are seen as
an insurance against multiple infant (and child) deaths and accordingly,
high infant mortality stymies all efforts at reducing TFR.
</p>

<p>
Over 50 per cent of girls marry below the age of 18, the minimum legal
age of marriage, resulting in a typical reproductive pattern of ‘too early,
too frequent, too many’. ArOund 33 per cent births occur at intervals of
less than 24 months, which also results in high IMR.
</p>

</p>

<p>
During the Tenth Plan, the paradigm shift, which began in the Ninth Plan,
will be fully operationalized. The shift was from:

. Demographic targets to focusing on enabling couples to achieve their
reproductive goals;

. Method— specific contraceptive targets to meet all the unmet needs for
contraception to reduce unwanted pregnancies;

. Numerous vertical programmes for family planning and maternal
and child health to integrated health care for women and children;

. Centrally defined targets to community assessment and decentralized
area micro planning and implementation of programme for health
care for women and children, reduce infant mortality and reduce
high fertility;

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000229">229</pagenum>
 <h1>
Page no:229
</h1>
<p>
. Predominantly women centred programmes meeting the health care
needs and emphasis on the involvement of planned parenthood;

. Supply- driven service to demand driven service; improved logistics
ensuring adequate and timely supplies the needs; and

. Service provision based on providers’ perception to addressing
choices and conveniences of the couples.
  </p>

<p>
The population growth rate continues to be high due to the following reasons:

. The large size of the population in the reproductive age- group
(accounting for an estimated 60 per cent of the total population
growth)

. Higher fertility due to the unmet need for contraception (contributing
to around 20 per cent of the population growth)

. High wanted fertility due to the prevailing high IMR and other socioeconomic
reasons (estimated contribution of about 20 per cent of the
population growth).
  </p>

<p>
The Tenth Plan fully operationalized its efforts to:

. Assess and meet the unmet needs for contraception;

. Achieve reduction in the high desired level of fertility through programmes
for reduction in IMR and MMR; and

. Enable families to achieve their reproductive goals.
  </p>

<p>
If the reproductive goals of families are fully met, the country will be able to
achieve the National Population Policy goal of replacement level of fertility
by 2010. The medium- and long-term goals will be to continue this process
to accelerate the pace of demographic transition and achieve population stabilization
by 2045. Early population stabilization will enable the country to
achieve its developmental goal of improving the economic status and quality
of life of the citizens.
  </p>

<p>
Reductions in fertility, mortality and the population growth rate will be
major objectives during the Tenth Plan. The following are 3 of the 11 monitorable
targets for the Tenth Plan and beyond:

. Reduction in IMR to45 per 1000 live births by 2007 and 28 per 1000
live births by 2012

. Reduction in maternal mortality ratio to 2 per 1000 live births by
2007 and 1 per 1000 live births by 2012

. Reduction in decadal growth rate of the population during 2001—
 2011 to 16.2.

<p>
FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMME

Population growth has long been a concern of the government, and India has
a lengthy history of explicit population policy. In the 1950s, the government
began, in a modest way, one of the earliest national, government- sponsored
family planning efforts in the developing world. The annual population
growth rate in the previous decade (1941—1951) had been below 1.3 per cent,
and government planners optimistically believed that the population would
continue to grow at roughly the same rate.
</p>

<p>
Implicitly, the government believed that India could repeat the experience
of the developed nations where industrialization and a rise in the standard
of living had been accompanied by a drop in the population growth
rate. In the 1950s, the existing hospitals and health care facilities made birth
control information available, but there was no aggressive effort to encour-
age the use of contraceptives and limitation of family size. By the late 19603,
many policy makers believed that the high rate of population growth was
the greatest obstacle to economic development. The government began a
massive programme to lower the birth rate from 41 per 1000 to a target of
20—25 per 1000 by the mid- 19703. The National Population Policy adopted in
1976 reﬂected the growing consensus among policy makers that family plan-
ning would enjoy only limited success unless it was a part of an integrated
programme aimed at improving the general welfare of the population. The
policy makers assumed that the excessive family size was part and parcel
of poverty and had to be dealt with as integral to a general development
strategy. Education about the population problem became a part of school
curriculum under the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974—78). Cases of government-
enforced sterilization made many question the propriety of state-sponsored
birth control measures, however.
</p>

<p>
During the 19803, an increased number of family planning programmes
were implemented through the state governments with ﬁnancial assistance
from the central government. In rural areas, the programmes were further
extended through a network of primary health centres and subcentres. By
1991, India had more than 150,000 public health facilities through which
family planning programmes were offered. Four special family planning
projects were implemented under the Seventh Five—Year Plan (1985—89).
One was the All-India Hospitals Post—partum Programme at district and
subdistrict—‘level hospitals. Another programme involved the reorganization
of primary health care facilities in urban slum areas, while another project
reserved a speciﬁed number of hospital beds for tubal ligature operations.
The ﬁnal programme called for the renovation or remodelling of intrauter—
ine device (IUD) rooms in rural family welfare centres attached to primary
health care faCilities.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000231">231</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:231
</h1>
<p>
Despite these developments in promoting family planning, the 1991
census results showed that India cOntinued to have one of the most rapidly
growing populations in the world. Between 1981 and 1991, the annual
rate of the population growth was estimated at about 2 per cent. The crude
birth rate in 1992 was 30 per 1000, only a small change over the 1981 level
of 34 per 1000. HOwever, some demographers credit this slight lowering of
the 1981—91 population growth rate to moderate successes of the Family
Planning Programme. In 1986, the number of reproductive-age couples was
132.6 million, of whom only 37.5 per cent were estimated to be protected
effectively by some form of contraception. A goal of the seventh plan was
to achieve an effective couple prOtection rate of 42 per cent, requiring an
annual increase of 2 per cent in effective use of contraceptives.
</p>

<p>
The heavy centralization of India’s family planning programmes often
prevents due consideration from being given to regional differences
Centralization is encouraged to a large extent by reliance on central government funding. As a result, many of the goals and assumptions of national
population control programmes do not correspond exactly with local
attitudes towards birth control. At the Jamkhed Project in Maharashtra,
which has been in operation since the late 1970s and covers approximately
175 villages, the local project directors noted that it required 3—4 years of
education through direCt contact with a couple for the idea of family planning to gain acceptance. Such a timetable was not compatible with targets.
However, much was learned about policy and practice from the Jamkhed
Project. The successful use of women’s clubs as a means of involving women
in community-wide family planning activities impressed the state government
to the degree that it set about organizing such clubs in every Village
in the state. The project also serves as a pilot to test ideas that the government wants to incorporate into its programmes. Government medical staff
members have been sent to Jamkhed for training, and the government has
proposed that the project assume the task of selecting and training government health workers for a population of 2.5 million people.
</p>

<p>
Another important family planning programme is the Project for
Community Action in Family Planning. Located in Karnataka, the project
operates in 154 project villages and 255 control villages. All project villages
are of sufficient size to have a health subcentre, although this advantage is
offset by the fact that those villages are the most distant from the area’s primary health centres. As at Jamkhed, the project is much assisted by local
voluntary groups, such as the women’s clubs. The local voluntary groups
either provide or secure sites suitable as distribution depots for condoms and
birth control pills and also make arrangements for the operation of sterilization camps. Data provided by the Project for Community Action in Family
Planning show that important achievements have been realized in the field
of population control. By the mid-1980s, for example, 43 per cent of couples
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000232">232</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 232
</h1>
<p>
	were using family planning, a full 14 per cent above the state average. The
project has significantly improved the status of women, involving them and
empowering them to bring about a change in their communities. This contribution
is important because of the way in which the deeply entrenched
inferior status of women in many communities in India negates official
efforts to decrease the fertility rate.
</p>

<p>
Studies have found that most of the couples, in fact, regard family planning positively. However, the common fertility pattern in India diverges
from the two- child family that policy makers hold as ideal. Women continue
to marry young; in the mid-1990s, they average just over 18 years of
age at marriage. When women choose to be sterilized, financial inducements,
although helpful, are not the principal incentives. On average,
those accepting sterilization already have 4 living children, of whom two
are sons.
</p>

<p>
The strong preference for sons is a deeply held cultural ideal based on
economic roots. Sons not only assist with farm labour as they grow up (as
do daughters) but also provide labour in times of illness and unemployment
and serve as their parents’ only security in old age. Surveys indicated that
as many as 72 per cent of rural parents continue to have children until at
least two sons are born; the preference for more than one son among urban
parents was tabulated at 53 per cent. Once these goals have been achieved,
birth control may be used or, especially in agricultural areas, it may not
be, if additional child labour, later adult labour for the family is deemed
desirable.
</p>

<p>
A significant result of this eagerness for sons is that the Indian population
has a deficiency of females. Slightly higher female infant mortality rates
(79 per 1000 versus 78 per 1000 for males) can be attributed to poor health
care, abortions of female foetuses, and female infanticide. Human rights
activists have estimated that there are at least 10,000 cases of female infanticide annually throughout India. The cost of theoretically illegal dowries
and the loss of daughters to their in-laws’ families are further disincentives
for some parents to have daughters. Sons, of course, continue to carry on
the family line. The 1991 Census revealed that the national sex ratio had
declined from 934 females to 1000 males in 1981 to 927 to 1000 in 1991.
In only one state—Kerala, a state with low fertility and mortality rates and
the nation’s highest literacy— did females exceed males. The census found,
however, that female life expectancy at birth had for the first time exceeded
that for males.
</p>

<p>
India’s high infant mortality and elevated mortality in early childhood
remain significant stumbling blocks to population control. India’s fertility
rate is deCreasing, however, and, at 3.4 in 1994, it is lower than those of its
immediate neighbours (Bangladesh had a rate of 4.5 and Pakistan had 6.7).
The rate is projected to decrease to 3.0 by 2000, 2.6 by 2010 and 2.3 by 2020.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000233">233</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:233
</h1>
<p>
During the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the growth rate had formed
a sort of plateau. Some states, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and, to a lesser
extent, Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka, had made progress in lowering
their growth rates, but most others did not. Under such conditions, India’s
population may not stabilize until 2060.
 </p>

<p>
EVOLUTION OF INDIA’S POPULATION POLICY

Unlike in the case of several other developing countries, the Indian concern
about the relatively high level of fertility or the number of children
born to Indian women rather than the rate of population growth refleCted
a genuine desire to improve the living standards of the people. During the
1920s and 1930s, some pioneers had set up family planning clinics in Poona
and Bangalore. In the 1940s, the Bhore Committee on Health Survey and
Development (1946) and the subcommittee on population set up by the
National Planning Committee (1940) favoured the involvement of the government
in the promotion of family planning. Not surprisingly, therefore,
the memorandum submitted by the Family Planning Association of India,
set up in 1949 under the Presidentship of Lady Dhanvanthi Rama Rau, elicited
a favourable response from the Planning Commission.
 </p>

<p>
The Health Panel, chaired by the Health Minister Rajkumari Amrit
Kaur, had appointed a subcommittee on the population growth and family
planning. R. A. Gopalswami, the Census Commissioner in charge of the
first census of independent India, was its convener. There were differences of
opinion. The Health Minister insisted that ‘no contraceptives should be used’.
But, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru supported a more flexible approach
and also the idea of state action to promote family planning. It was because
of the report of this subcommittee that in 1952 India became the first develOping country in the world to adopt a policy of governmental efforts to promote
a reduction in the number of children born to Indian couples.
 </p>

<p>
Simultaneously, there was a considerable effort to initiate varied programmes
to lower the level of morbidity and malnutrition and to raise life
expectancy at birth from the then low value of around 32 years. Thus, the
early concept of population policy covered both mortality and fertility and
did not exclusively focus on fertility. There was also recognition of the need
to improve the quality of life of the people by lowering the burden of disease
or morbidity, promoting universal primary education and eradicating illiteracy, exploitation and poverty.
 </p>

<p>
There were references to an urgent need to slow down the pace of
rural— urban migration and the growth of major cities where it was proving
difficult and expensive to provide basic amenities to people. However,
these statements did not constitute a ‘policy’ on population distribution
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000234">234</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 234
</h1>
<p>
or urbanization. This was not really surprising because prior to the 1961
Census, the database relating to migration was scanty. Reports of even the 25
‘city surveys’ commissioned by the Research Programmes Committee of the
Planning Commission in the 1950s became available later.
  </p>

<p>
The effective date of the adoption and implementation of a clear family
planning programme is often put at 1966, When the ‘extension approach’
to the promotion of family planning throughout the country replaced the
earlier clinic- oriented approach. The earlier approach seeking to set up a
large number of family planning clinics was based on the experiences of concerned social workers and professionals in urban areas who were trying to
initiate a major programme of social engineering without any precedents to
follow.
  </p>

<p>
A separate Department of Family Planning was set up in the Ministry
of Health during the Fourth Five— Year Plan period. Around the same time,
a ‘time— bound’ target of reducing the crude birth rate from about 39 to 25
per 1000 population in 10—12 years was adopted. In practice, it has been a
moving target and was not achieved even by 1999, the last year for which
estimates of birth and death rates are available from the Sample Registration
System set up in the 1960s.
  </p>

<p>
Slippages in the achievement of this goal and the resulting frustration led
to the outburst of a special drive during the emergency period of 1975—77 to
promote sterilization. The elections following the withdrawal of Emergency
led to the fall of the government. The Janata Party government supported
a voluntary family welfare programme without any of the alleged excesses
of the emergency period. The backlash to the 1975—76 drive Continued for
several years and was a setback for the programme.
  </p>

<p>
A Working Group on the Population Policy, set up by the Planning
Commission, recommended in 1980 was an unrealistic goal before the
country: a Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) of 1.0 by 1996 as a national average
and by 2001 in all the states. On the basis of several assumptions about
the method-mix of contraception, the presumed efficacy of different methods,
a rise in the age at marriage, and a lowering of the IMR to 60 per 1000
live— births, a simulation exercise was done. An effective couple protection
rate (ECPR) of 60 per cent was expected to lead to a birth rate of 21 and a
death rate of 9. These estimates were incorporated in the draft Sixth Five- Year Plan as well as the National Health Policy of 1983 and became accepted
national goals.
  </p>

<p>
The limitations of the approach adopted by the Working Group are evident
in the fact that even in the state of Punjab, where the reported ECPR
exceeded 68 per cent, the birth rate in 1996 was 23.7 and the total fertility
rate (TFR) in 1997 was 2.7, much above the replacement level of fertility. Of
course, Kerala as well as Tamil Nadu reported a below- or near- replacement
level of fertility, with a TFR of 1.8 and 2.0, respectively, in 1997. In the middle

<p>
of 2000, the death rate was 9.0 but the IMR did not drop to 60 and the birth
rate of 21 or NRR of 1.0 in the country as a whole is still far away. In fact,
in 1992, the Eighth Plan had recognized that the NRR of 1.0 was likely to
be attained only during 2011—16; and the Ninth Plan accepted the very real
possibility that the replacement level of fertility may be reached only by 2021
in the country as a Whole and in some states much later.
 </p>

<p>
In the 1980s, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi initiated an effort to revise
the strategy of the Family Welfare Programme, but little came of it. In 1992,
the Karunakaran Committee, set up by the National Development Council
(NDC) partly in response to the 1991 Census results, recommended the
formulation of a National Population Policy. A draft prepared by an expert
group under the chairmanship of M. S. Swaminathan in 1994 was circulated
widely and its successive variants were considered by the cabinets of three
different coalition governments. The drafts underwent several revisions until
finally the NPP 2000 was announced.
 </p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, the state governments began to follow the suggestion
of the Swaminathan group to formulate state level population policies.
Even before the expert group was set up to prepare a draft of the national
population policy, the government of Tamil Nadu had formulated a 15-point
programme for child Welfare, to improve the health and nutrition of women
and children in the state. The programme had incorporated in it the goals
relating to infant and child mortality and the birth and death rates.
 </p>

<p>
Subsequently, in 1997, the government of Andhra Pradesh prepared a
state population policy. At the end of July 1999, the Cabinet of Rajasthan
state had approved the population policy of Rajasthan. In January 2000,
Madhya Pradesh came out with its population policy. Recently, Uttar
Pradesh also drafted a population policy. These state- level population policies
are expected to help the departments of family welfare in the states to
mobilize greater effort towards population goals and related programmes.

SWAMINATHAN COMMISSION AND INDIA’S NEW
POPULATION POLICY

The Swaminathan Commissions Proposal for Social and Demographic
Change observed that, India will enter the twenty- first century with close
to a billion people, the majority of whom lack even the basic amenities
necessary for a healthy and dignified existence. Future governments will
be challenged by the task of providing employment and minimal living
standards for nearly 17 per cent of the global population. The task is rendered
more difficult by a relatively rapid rate of population growth that
results in the addition of nearly 20 million to the population every year.
However the conventional family planning approach with its emphasis on
 </p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000236">236</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:236
</h1>
<p>
contraceptive targets, (i.e., the number of couples using contraception) has
shown to be ineffective for a variety of reasons.
</p>

<p>
India’s family planning approach of the past few decades has been criticized
for its narrow focus on contraception, a reliance on female sterilization
and insensitivity towards women and women’s health. Women’s groups in
India have criticized the Family Planning Programme for targeting primarily
women— who are the least powerful decision -makers in the family and
society— and for not involving men in the family planning process.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, research on fertility (childbearing) suggests that a sole
reliance on contraceptive acceptance as a means of curbing fertility seldom
succeeds, and that family planning efforts are more effective when coupled
with other programmes that simultaneously promote health and welfare
(including education). The UN International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo (1994) affirmed the need to focus on women’s welfare
as the cornerstone of national population policy, and recognized that child bearing patterns in a society are inextricably linked with women’s status and
welfare.
</p>

<p>
The draft population policy produced by the Swaminathan Commission
in 1994, recognized the need to move away from the narrow contraceptive—
target approach of the past, and called for major changes in the thinking
about population reduction goals. The Swaminathan Commission report
presented a more sophisticated View of population dynamics, and in particular,
of the interrelationship between childbearing patterns, and social and
economic conditions in the Indian society. The report explicitly recognized
that future reductions in population growth would depend on wide-rang-
ing changes in social and economic conditions of women and underprivileged
groups. In keeping with this View, the new population policy called
for changes in women’s status, full implementation of the Minimum Needs
Programme, a rehauling of family planning services, more choices and counselling
for potential contraceptive users, a closer link between family planning
and women and children’s health services, and incentives for couples
who adopt the small family norm. It also called for political commitment
to population goals at all levels of the government—local (Panchayats and
Nagar Palikas), district and state—in a clear recognition that central government initiatives are generally killed off at the lOcal and state levels. The NPP
also affirmed the need for involving NGOs who have emerged as a significant
force in effecting social change at the grassroots level in India.
</p>

<p>
Another innovative idea of the Swaminathan Commission report was
that local initiatives and solutions were to be encouraged— ‘Think, plan
and act locally and support nationally’ India is becoming increasingly more
diverse in terms of fertility behaviour, and there are now fairly substantial
differences in childbearing statistics between states. The most populous
northern state, Uttar Pradesh, has one of the highest total fertility rates

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000237">237</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 237
</h1>
<p>
(TFR) in the country—5.1 children which is over twice the total fertility rate
in Kerala, 1.8 children. A TFR of 2.1 is known as replacement-level fertility,
and a TFR of 1.8 means that Kerala’s population is no longer growing, but
instead has begun to decline slowly. By comparison, Uttar Pradesh’s population
is growing, quite rapidly. Clearly, there is a need to focus attention on
states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan that contribute
disproportionately to annual increases in India’s population.
  </p>

 <p>
The Swaminathan Commission also proposed 10 socio-demographic
goals to be achieved by the year 2010. The goals entail major changes in programme
focus and substantial investment in health, education, contraception,
enforcement (of marriage laws) and monitoring activities.
  </p>

<p>
NATIONAL POPULATION POLICY, 2000

The objective of the National Population Policy 2000 is to address the unmet
needs of contraception, health care infrastructure and health personnel, and
to provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health
care. The medium-term objective is to bring the TFR to replacement levels
by 2010, through vigorous implementation Of intersectoral operational
strategies. The long-term objective is to achieve a stable population by 2045,
at a level consistent with the requirements of sustainable economic growth,
social development and environmental protection.
  </p>

<p>
In pursuance of these objectives, the following National Socio Demographic
Goals to be achieved in each case by 2010 were formulated:

i. Address the unmet needs for basic reproductive and child health services,
supplies and infrastructure.

ii. Make school education up to age 14 free and compulsory, and reduce
dropouts at primary and secondary school levels to below 20 per cent
for both boys and girls.

iii. Reduce infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births.

iv. Reduce maternal mortality ratio to below 100 per 100,000 live births.

V. Achieve universal immunization of children against all vaccine- preventable
diseases.

vi. Promote late marriage for girls, not earlier than age 18 and preferably
after 20 years of age.

vii. Achieve 80 per cent institutional deliveries and 100 per cent deliveries
by trained persons.

viii. Achieve universal access to information/ counselling, and services for
fertility regulation and contraception with a wide basket of choices.

  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000238">238</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:238
</h1>
<p>
ix. Achieve 100 per cent registration of births, deaths, marriages and
pregnancies.

X. Contain the spread of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
(AIDS), and promote greater integration between the management
of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and sexually transmitted infections
(STI) and the National AIDS Control Organization.

xi. Prevent and control communicable diseases.

xii. Integrate Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM) in the provision of
reproductive and child health services, and in reaching out to
households.

xiii. Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement
levels of TFR.

xiv. Bring about convergence in the implementation of related social sector
programmes so that family welfare becomes a people- centred
programme.
 </p>

<p>
It may be the quest for the so—called holistic approach to population containment
which is reflected in the list of 14 goals in the new policy or it can
be the plain realization that it is an agenda of human development which
is focussed on women and children which constitutes the most practical
manifestation of a population policy. Of the 14 goals specified in the Policy
2000, one relates to the long- neglected imperative of free and compulsory
school education along with that of reducing the school dropout ratio. Few
others relate to the area of health and in particular to the need to reduce
the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the maternal mortality ratio besides the
universalization of immunization of children against all vaccine- preventable
diseases.
 </p>

<p>
NEW POPULATION POLICY (NPP): SOCIO- DEMOGRAPHIC
GOALS FOR 2010

The key objective of the Policy 2000 is to bring the fertility rate to ‘replacement’
levels by 2010 and the long-term goal will be to achieve a stable population
by the year 2045. The Union Cabinet endorsed the policy and accepted
a system of incentives for couples adopting the small family norm, opting to
do away with disincentives. It remains to be seen if this exercise will achieve
the desired results, because, given the illiteracy, unless the people see the
disincentives for large families, they may not be inclined to stop with two
children. The core of the population problem in the country centres on the
higher fertility rate among the poorer sections and the explosion taking
place in the less developed states.

. Universal access to contraceptives to lower the total fertility rate to 2.1
by the year 2010.

. Delivery of all births by trained workers.

. Reduction of maternal mortality to 100 per 100,000.

. Immunization of all children against TB, polio, diphtheria, whooping
cough, tetanus and measles.

. Reduction of the infant mortality rate to 30 per 1000, reduction in
mortality among children aged 1—4 years and the number of low birth
weight babies (under 2500 grams).

. Full access to all relevant contraceptive information.

. Containment of AIDS and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases).

. Complete registration of births, deaths and marriages.

. Prevention of marriages of girls aged below 18 years, the legal minimum
age at marriage.

. Implementation of the Minimum Needs Programme and in particular,
universal access to primary education for both sexes.
</p>

<p>
The Swaminathan Commission’s proposals for reducing fertility constitute a
fairly radical programme of social change although no single recommendation
by itself appears particularly revolutionary. The NPP identifies changes
in women’s status, and implementation of the Minimum Needs Programme
as necessary conditions for bringing about significantly lower fertility. The
Commission’s report implies that curbing population growth in India will
not come about merely by offering easier access to contraception, but will
also require significant changes in social attitudes and living standards.

births desirable.

1951: The draft outline of the First Five- Year Plan reCognized ‘population
policy’ as‘ essential to planning’ and ‘family planning’ as
a ‘step towards improvement in health of mothers and children’.

1952: The final First Five-Year Plan document noted the ‘urgency of
 the problems of family planning and population Control’ and
advocated a reduction in the birth rate to stabilize populatiOn
at a level consistent with the needs of the economy.

1956:  The Second Five Year Plan proposed expansion of family planning
clinics in both rural and urban areas and recommended a
more or less autonomous Central Family Planning Board, With
similar state level boards A

1959: The Government of Tamil Nadu began to pay small cash grants
to poor persons undergoing sterilization as compensation for
lost earnings and transport costs and also to canvassers and
tutors in family planning.

1961: The Third Five Year Plan envisaged the proviSion of sterilization
facilities in district hospitals, subdivisional hospitals
and primary health centres as a part of the Family Planning
Programme. The state of Maharashtra organized  ‘sterilization
camps’ in rural areas

1963: The Director of Family Planning proposed a shift from the
clinic approach to a community extension apprOach to be
implemented by auxiliary nurse midwives (one per 10,000
population) located in PHCs . Other proposals included: (a) a
goal Of lowering the birth rate from an estimated 40 to 25 by
 1973; and (b) a cafeteria apprOach to the provision of contraceptive
 methods, with an emphasis on free choiace.

1965: The intrauterine device Was introduced in the Indian Family
Planning Programme.

1966: A full- fledged Department of Family Planning was set up in

problem to bring about a sharp drop in fertility. The
Constitution Was amended to freeze the representation of different
states in the lower house of the Parliament according to the
size of population in the 1971 Census. The states were permitted
to enact legislation providing for compulsory sterilization.

1977: A revised population policy statement was tabled in the
Parliament by a government formed by the former opposition
parties. It emphasized on the voluntary nature of the Family
planning’.

1982: The draft Sixth Five -Year plan adopted a long-term goal of
attaining a net reproduction rate of 1.0 on the average by 1996
and in all states by 2001. It adopted the targets for crude birth
and death rates, infant mortality rate and life expectancy at
birth and the couple  protection rate to be achieved by 2001.

1983: The National Health Policy incorporated the targets included
in the sixth five- year plan document. While adopting the
Health policy, the Parliament emphasized on the need for a
separate National Population Policy.

1993: A committee Population, set up by the National Development
Council in 1991 , in the wake of the census results, proposed
the formulation of  a National Population Policy.

1994: The Expert Group, set up by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare in 1993 to draft the National Population Policy, recommended
the goal of a replacement level of fertility (a total fertility
rate of 2.1) by 2010. Other proposals of the expert group included
(i) removal of method- specific targets down to the grassroots
level; (ii) an emphasis on improving the quality of services; (iii)
a removal of all incentives in cash or kind and (iv) a National
Commission on Population and Social Development under the
chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The draft statement was circulated
among the members of the Parliament and various ministries
at the centre  and among the states for comments.

1997: Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister I. K. Gujral approved
a draft National Population Policy to be placed before the
Parliament. With  the dissolution of the lower house of the
Parliament, the action was postponed.

CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS TO POPULATION POLICIES

The following are the challenges and limitations to population policies:

i. Socio-economic constraints: High levels of illiteracy, poor access to
information, poverty and gender -based disparities serve as significant
barriers to family planning. These include social stereotyping,
lack of male involvement in family planning and continuing open
discrimination against the female child, adolescent girls and women.

ii. Programmatic constraints: Major constraints include limited
resources, lack of an integrated multisectoral approach, insufficient
information education and communication (IEC) support and a
weak health management information system.

iii. Limited awareness of reversible methods: DAYA Awareness of
reversible methods is relatively limited among women and men
alike. Information given to clients by providers regarding contraceptive
methods is typically inadequate, most providers have a bias attitude
towards sterilization and only a small proportion of clients are
informed of reversible methods.

iv. Staff shortages and limitations: Staff shortages continue to plague
the services at all levels. Where workers are available, they are generally
poorly trained and have little knowledge of the methods they are
promoting.

v Limited access to quality health services: Access to quality health
services is limited in both urban and rural areas. A substantial population
residing in slum areas has no access to family planning services
owing to poor health infrastructure. Furthermore, only 37 per
cent of rural women live in a village with a primary health centre or
subcentre. Important subgroups, such as adolescents are neglected or

<p>
under- served. Contraceptive choice and the quality of and access to
care are limited within the programme.
 </p>

 <p>
SUMMARY

. India, the second most populous country in the world, with more
than a billion people was the first to initiate a government policy of
promoting a family planning programme in 1952. The programme
was launched with the objective of reducing birth rates to the extent
necessary to stabilize population at a level consistent with the requirements
of the national economy, The programme has since evolved
through a number of stages, and has changed direction, emphasis and
strategies. During the first decade of its existence, family planning
was considered more a mechanism to improve the health of mothers
and children than a method of population control. Over time, how —
ever, the primary focus of the programme became the achievement of
demographic goals.


. With growing concerns about the rate of population growth and its
adverse effect on the pace of social and economic development, the
Third Five-Year Plan period (1961-66) marked a subtle shift in the
emphasis of the programme from the welfare of women and children
to the macro- objective of population stabilization. During 1965—75,
the programme was integrated with the maternal and child health
programme. This period also witnessed the introduction of time—
bound method- specific targets within the programme.

. It is well known that the target- oriented approach became highly
coercive during the Emergency period (1975—77). The National
Population Policy 1976 called for a ‘frontal attack on the problems of
population’ and inspired state governments to ‘pass suitable legislation
to make family planning compulsory for citizens’. The backlash
of the coercive approach compelled subsequent governments to stress
the voluntary nature of family planning acceptance. The Population
Policy 1977 emphasized On the need for an educational and motivational
approach to make acceptance of family planning completely
voluntary. However, in the 1980s, the time- bound, target- oriented
approach was revived and efforts to encourage the use of reversible
methods were initiated. Incentive payments were vigorously promoted
during this period.

. The 1990s witnessed dramatic changes in the family welfare policy
and programme in the country. The passing of the 72nd and 73rd

<p>
Constitutional Amendments and the Panchayati Raj and Nagar Palika
Acts in 1992 set in motion the process of democratic decentralization,
and brought the Family Welfare Programme, legally, in the domain
of Panchayati Raj institutions. In addition, several factors including
stagnation in the Family Welfare Programme, organized pressure
from multiple constituencies to bring issues of quality and choice
into the programme, and the National Population Policy, adopted in
February 2000, further legitimized the paradigm shift to client-based
services. The National Population Commission was set up in May
2000 to guide the translation of policy rhetoric into programmes.
 </p>

 <p>
. The National Population Policy provides a policy framework for
achieving the twin objectives of population stabilization and promoting
reproductive health within the wider context of sustainable
development. The objectives of the National Population Policy were
to address the unmet need for contraception, the limitations in health
care infrastructure and the shortages in health personnel, and to
provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child
health care. In the medium term, the National Population Policy aims
to achieve the goal of bringing the total fertility rate to replacement
level by 2010. To achieve this task, the government has to broaden
its concerns to include the delivery of a whole package of high quality
family planning services to the people, instead of promoting only
particular methods of contraception, such as sterilization.

POPULATION

The word ‘population’ consistently brings to one’s mind varied reflections,
crises and solutions. Most of us nurture, without even apprehending it, our
own preconceived notions about the nature and extent of population problems,
and our own ideas about solving them. In the past, the solution most
often suggested to deal with population problems was largely framed in partial
terms. However, partial solutions do not solve problems and may, in fact,
exacerbate them. What is needed is to seek solutions that see all of the parts
in their total context. Hence, the need to understand population problems in
their total developmental contexts.

<p>
DEVELOPMENT

Because development engrosses many constituents in performance within
an amalgamated social structure, the 1970s and 1980s witnessed the surfacing
of a healthy scepticism concerning the indirect, so- -called trickle- down
approach to do development which characterized so much of programme
activities in the previous decades. The concept of development, which is
increasingly stressing itself today, has one vital focus: the environment, both
physical and biological, must be improved to a tip where each individual can
attain his or her full human budding.
 </p>


<p>
POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT

Population is at the nucleus of development, and population trends are a key
element of the milieu in which development takes place. As a result, population
policies are directed towards influencing demographic behaviour and
population dynamics.
 </p>

<p>
The question of population, then, is one which has an influence on all
the inputs of development planning. The development programmes always
cope with the life of the individual and change it for the better or worse;
and the developmental decision by the policy makers and decision makers
must have at least the implicit support of the people whom the decision will
be imposed on. A population is a calculation of people reproducing itself;
a social phenomenon, a result of society’s development and a condition
required for its development. It is, therefore, a common saying that population
is the sum of social relations between people since man is basically the
sum of all social relations.
 </p>

<p>
Dr. R. Salas and Prof. D. Valentei (1986) in a book Population and
Socio-economic Development (Progress Publishers, Moscow) state that the
processes in the population’s natural reproduction are just an component
in the overall process of population development which is identical to the
concept of demographic processes; processes of natural reproduction have a
biological basis, but, at the same time, they depend on life and work conditions,
which in turn are determined by the stage of productive forces and the
nature of the relations of production existing in a society. Since demographic
processes are of social nature, they experience the guiding influence of the
development of the mode of production and have a reactive effect on the
development of productive forces and economic relations.
 </p>

<p>
A little different to the problem of population development and its value
is possible with stress on description of the population’s Vital functions which
is also exceptionally important in elaborating policies of social development.
The experts divide vital functions of population into three groups:
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000247">247</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:247
</h1>
<p>
i. Descriptions of inner and outer conditions in respect to the specific
sphere of activity;

ii. Descriptions of the activities; and

iii. Descriptions of the state of the subject of activity.
 </p>
<p>
A considerable climb in productivity occurred in the mid- twentieth
century. The remarkable growth in science and technology secured a high
standard of living for the wealthy sectors of the population in the developed
countries, and this fact strengthened the ecstasy of unrestricted consumption.
This high level of consumption was attained at the COst of a 100—fold
boost in the power- intensity of productivity produced: the achievements of
the technical revolution outshine such figures.
 </p>

<p>
Population growth is responsible for poverty, hunger and environmental
degradation which are dangerous. For example,

i. Blaming environmental problems on overpopulation lets the real culprits
off the hook. The richest five of the world’s people consume 66
times more resources than the poorest five.

ii. People go hungry because they neither have land to grow food nor
the money to buy it. This situation is not because world agriculture
cannot produce enough food.

iii. Some population control programmes lead to unsafe contraception
and involuntary sterilization.
 </p>

<p>
POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Population issues are critical in understanding the environment and its con
sequences. In global dialogues and modelling workout, the impact of population
on greenhouse gas emission (the aspect of climate change related to
human activities) has often been discussed simplistiCally. Recent research
and analysis show that the relationship is complex, and is deepening the
understanding of population and ecology.

IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION

The social sciences first turned to problems of economic and social development
in their actual form following Second World War. The first phase in working out
the underdevelopment theory was marked by optimism and a firm belief that it
was possible to overcome backwardness. and create a ‘normal’ capitalist society.
 </p>

<p>
The idea of massive injections of capital in its final form became the
concept of ‘big push’. The estimated global population is around 6 billion, of
which 3 billion live in Asia. The total worldwide assets of all countries are
estimated at $150 trillion as at end of 2005. The richest 2 per cent of the

<p>
adults, approximately 120 million people, control 50 per cent of the global
wealth. Out of the above, 1 per cent or 60 million control 40 per cent of it.
The balance 1 per cent or 60 million people control the rest 10 per cent of
it. Fifty per cent of the world’s population has an asset or net worth of less
than $2200 or around Rs 88,000. The rest 48 per cent do not have any assets
at all. The United States of America, the richest country in the world, has the
highest per capita income of $180,837. Japan follows it with $143,427. Canada
has a per capita income of $89,252 and has 0.2 per cent of the wealthiest
1 per cent in the world. The bottom 125 countries have per capita income of
less than $500. In some of the poorest countries, people earn just a dollar a day
or even less. The scars of misery and deprivation mar the face and heart of the
world. It presents a ‘picture of horror and dejection for majority of people who
were born to face a slow and agonizing death’. (Dadayan 1988). It is reported in
New Times that, ‘in the Third World there are now starving over 500 million;
life expectancy under 60—1.7 billion; lacking medical care—1.5 billion; living
in extreme poverty—over 1 billion; unemployed and underemployed—more
than 500 million; annual per capita income under $150—800 million; illiterate
adults — 814 million; children having no access to school education and
unable to attend school—over 200 billion’ (Cited in Dadayan 1988). Tinbergen
(1976) notes, ‘we have a situation where, in the Third World, millions of people
toil under a broiling sun from morning till dusk for miserable rewards and
premature death without even discovering the reasons why’. The ratio of per
capita product in the underdeveloped countries and developed countries was
only 1 and 1.2, respectively, in 1770. The per capita income at the turn of the
nineteenth century in the developed and underdeveloped countries was $190
and $150, respectively, and the ratio at the beginning of the twentieth century
was 1 in case of developing countries and 14+ for developed countries. This
ratio denotes a horrible picture of dejection and inequality.
 </p>

  <p>
The reason was certainly the manifestation of executive capitalism,
which made the disparity and the division in individuals. The process of
exploitation of the people by the capitalists has changed its image from time
to time. Marx, on the exploitation by the colonists wrote: ‘The discovery of
gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in
mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting
of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial
hunting of black skins, signalized the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
production’. A Soviet social scientist, N.P. Shmelyov (1970) writes that the
treasure gained from beyond Europe by means of robbery, enslavement of
the people of America, Asia and Africa, murder, treachery and subordination
flowed into the metropolises Where it was turned into capital. And, ‘the
capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and
dirt’ (Marx). The third world countries have their own problems like one-
sided dependence, and economic and technological illness. The contracts

<p>
between wealth and poverty in the developing countries are sharper than
in their developed counterparts. In 1983 (the concept of Shadow globalization
opened its petals in 1960), Switzerland had per capital GDP
4.3 times that of Greece ($13,338 and $3,558, respectively), the per capita
GDP of the UAE was no less than 187 times that of Bangladesh ($23,546 and
$126, respectively). The 15 richest countries in the capitalist world included
seven developing states— there are 55 countries in the group where the per
capita GDP exceeds $1500, 55 between $150 and $1500 and 50 with less than
$500 of which the group of 38 least developed countries have a GDP equivalent
to $20.1 per capita, which is 50 times less than the developed capitalist
countries and 52 times less than the United States. Statistics reveals that the
income disparity among countries had increased worldwide since 1960 (the
mission of globalization started). It is evident from the world development
report that the wealthy countries have experienced a steady growth in their
share of the world GNP, while the poorest countries have experienced a tragic
decline in their share of world GNP. ‘Between 1960 and 1991, the richest fifth
of all nations had its share of world income rise from 70% to 85%, while the
poorest fifth of all nations had its share fall from 2.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent’
(UN Development Program 1994). This trend towards greater disparity gives
a very chronic indication of continuing into the next millennium (Sandler
1997). This sort of chronic disparity sounds the opus of dilemma whether
the globalization policy would be able to reduce the tension of conflict arising
from such an inequality or inequality itself would be a prime -mover in
economic equality, social integration and crisis reduction. This is perhaps the
globalization impasse.
</p>

<p>
With the emergence of the clink of globalization and population explosion,
the rate of global discrepancy is increasing with a very a steady and
rapid pace. The top poorest 40 per cent nations are suffering from chronic
development sore. They are not even curable even by the application of any
development steroid. The income disparity between top 20 per cent richest
countries and bottom  20 per cent poorest countries shows a district
mark of horror and dejection. The ratio of GNP between these two type
of nations, i.e. 61:1, is not only alarming but fatal too. There are some realistic
and perceivable enemies like poverty, disparity, economic inequality,
population explosion, terrorism, religious bigotry, fanaticism; global— local
dilemma and war- threatening exacerbate environmental problems. In 1994,
the global population stood at 5.6 billion with 1.2 billion in the developed
countries and 4.4 billion in the Third World (Source: UN POpulation Fund
1994). The earth is overstraining to take the load of such huge population
on its land surface. This population- land ratio causes ecological disequilibrium.
Poverty appears as human species— threatening phenomena. It is
the reality that climate change is not just an environmental issue but also a
major human issue that global players must respond to. To earn their livelihood,
poor people in the Third World countries have to depend on some

illegal wood smuggling activities. The unregistered and unofficial deforestation
accounts a huge amount which expedites the process of deforestation in
general. Next consider war, ethnic Violence and terrorism in which different
weapons including bombshell, gas, biological and chemical substances are
used in a very sporadic but large scale which cause severe eco damage. If
we consider the terrorist attacks on WTO and in Mumbai, the war in Iraq
and Afghanistan, the nuclear test in USA, China, India, Pakistan and other
countries, we may allege that the issue and saying of ‘New World Order’
is at stake. These make air terribly pollutant. According to Sandler (1997:
7), ‘Technology has become a two- edged sword in which beneficial aspects
are often associated with potentially negative consequences that are tied to
some of the global contingencies. Technologies that are used in cultivation
have also unfavourable effects on environment. ‘The green talk’ of farming
meant the upward jump of crops and yields but at the cost of menacing
pollutants. The pesticides, the chemical fertilizers and insecticides use
in agricultural production harmfully affect the health of the planet. It causes
soil contagion and serious health hazards to the human beings. So, profiting
drives of the agricultural and industrial big brothers make environment
obscure. This attitude develops into all the agreements/ conferences starting
from Antarctic Treaty (1959), convention of climate change (1993) to Kyoto
Protocol. Traders’ ravenousness, deprives’ hunger, ruler’s cruel and demoralizing
grip to acquire land of others, multinationals’ frantic challenge of
taking over the planet and the capitalist’s impervious attitude to accumulate
more capital by surveillance and regimentalism, and the escalation of local,
global and cross border terrorism invited environmental disaster. (Dasgupta
2008). Globalization can both be used as a way of procuring environmental
safeguards and create environment risk and eco disaster. Our environment
is a single whole and with the raison d’etre of one planet and one human race
we should walk around the global environmental scenario so that one could
comfortably identify the concealed of eco-disaster and nature threatening.
</p>

<p>
The mechanism of relative overpopulation in the developing countries
tends to become even more complex as their ‘multi- structural economy evolves
and new socio—economic contradictions’ appear. The wave of petty producer
pauperization due to disintegration of households as a result of the mounting
number of families intertwines in a complex manner with another wave— pauperization
under the impact of pre-capitalist exploitation; in their turn survivals
of pre-capitalist relations are sustained by overpopulation. At the same
time, development of commodity production and Capitalism ejects a large
mass of manpower with productivity into the sphere of full unemployment’.
Salas and Valentei (1986) write:

As a result of overpopulation, the fundamental contradiction between

acute antagonism abruptly re-forcing the downward tendency in the share
of surplus product in the system of the consumer economy and, in the
most critical cases, in its total supply. Thereby a great barrier was raised in
the way of the development of the economy— as a result, the scale of accumulation
is restricted and numerous and profound disproportions arise in
the mechanism of social reproduction.
</p>

<p>
The rise of relative overpopulation in the developing countries sharply
worsens the balance of labour and other economic resources, which under
other conditions, on the contrary, becomes even more favourable with the
advance of scientific and technological revolution.
</p>

<p>
POPULATION, ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY

Dasgupta and De (2009) state that as the century begins, natural resources
are under increasing threat, hampering the health conditions and the development
of the people on the earth. Water shortage, soil exhaustion, deforestation,
air and water pollution and degradation of coastlines badly affect many areas.
With the growing population, improving the living standards without environmental
destruction is a global challenge. The future of the earth and our
lives are tied to the overall social effects of population and the distribution of
population in the developing and developed countries. Population and ecology
are the determinants of environmental balance and development equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
Currently, most developed economies consume resources much faster
than they can regenerate. With rapid population growth, most developing
countries face the urgent need to improve their living standards. It -is undeniable
that human beings use the nature most to meet their present needs, and
therefore we are continually destroying natural resources for our livelihood.
It is evident from the reports that while population growth has slowed, the
absolute number of people continues to increase—by about 1 billion every
13 years. Deceleration in population growth would help improve the living
standards and would pay much time to protect natural resources. Ultimately,
to sustain higher living standards, world population size must stabilize.
Population growth is outpacing the capacity of a number of developing countries
to provide for their economic and social well-being. The pressures thus
generated are depleting the natural resources faster than they can be regenerated
and reducing their productivity, hence undermining the development.
</p>

<p>
They also argue that the environmentalists agree that efforts to save and
protect the environment and to achieve better living standards can be closely
linked and are mutually underpinning. Slowing the growth of population can
take pressure off the environment and procure time to improve living standards
on a sustainable basis. As population growth slows, countries can invest more in
education, health care, job creation and other improvements that help boosting
</p>

<p>
the living standards. In turn, as individual income, savings and investment rise,
more resources become available that can boost productivity. In recent years,
fertility has been falling in many developing countries and, as a result, annual
world population growth has come down by about 1.4 per cent in 2000 compared
with about 2 per cent in 1960. The UN estimated recently that the population
is growing by about 78 milliOn per year, down from about 90 million
estimated early in the 1990s. Nonetheless, at the current speed, world population
increases by about 1 billion every 13 years. World population is projected
to rise to over 8 billion by 2025. Globally, fertility has fallen by half since the
1960s, to about three children per woman. As population and demand for natural
resources continue to grow, environmental limits will become increasingly
apparent. It is evident from various reports that water shortages are expected to
affect nearly 3 billion people in 2025, with Sub-Saharan Africa being the worst
affected. Many countries can, as yet, avoid environmental hazards if they take
measures to conserve and handle supplies and demands well, ‘while slowing
population growth by providing families and individuals with information and
services needed to make informed choices about reproductive health?
</p>

<p>
Some claim that worries about a ‘population bomb’ may have lessened as
fertility rates have fallen, but the world’s population is projected to continue
expanding until the middle of the century. Its time of stability and, thus, the
level at which it stabilizes will have a powerful effect on living standards and
the global environment. As populatiOn size continues to reach levels never
before experienced and the per capita consumption rises, the environment
hangs in the balance.
</p>

<p>
There is no simple correlation between population and environment.
Population, environment and development factors interact in different
ways in different places. Not only the pace of development, but also its
content, location and the distribution of its benefits determine, in good
measure, the state of the environment. These factors also influence the
growth and distribution of population. Environmental resources provide
the basis for development just as environmental factors constitute part of
the improvement in the quality of life that development is meant to bring
about. Similarly, the size of population, the rate of its growth and the pattern
of its distribution influence the state of the environment, just as they
condition the pace and composition of development.
</p>

<p>
Population growth need not necessarily lower levels of livelihood make
worse the quality of life or cause environmental degradation. Global and
historical assessments of the earth’s capacity and man’s ingenuity to produce
goods and services have prompted some experts to project and optimistic
outlook (Simon 1981; Simon and Khan 1984). Growth of world
population has, in the past, been accompanied by a steady increase in the
world’s capacity to provide for the necessities and amenities of human life.
People have to be fed, clothed and provided for and this is achieved by
people themselves. In that process, the use and develop the resources of the

<p>
environment. Yet, just as some patterns of development have improved the
human environment, others have tended to degrade it, at times irreversibly.

                                                   	(Dasgupta and De 2009)
 </p>

<p>
In a large number of countries, notably in Africa, rapid growth of population
over the last decade has been accompanied by a steady decline in average
levels of living, as reflected in per capita incomes. It has also been accompanied
by a decline in the quality of life, as measured by indicators such
as per capita availability of food and nutrition, drinking water and sanitation.
Furthermore, the last decade has witnessed an increase in the number
of people with inadequate or no access to essential services (such as health
care) or amenities (such as shelter) in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
 </p>

<p>
The net absolute annual addition to the number of people is expected
to increase from about 78 million at present to about 90 million per year
by 2000. Thereafter, with declining net annual additions, the world population
may reach 8.2 billion by 2025 (according to the UN medium estimate)
and reach a stationary level of 10.5 billion by 2110. Population growth rates
have steadily declined, both globally and in the developing countries as a
group (UN 1985). While birth, death and infant mortality rates have fallen
consistently; life expectancies have risen in a large number of countries.
Some developed countries have already made the demographic transition
to population equilibrium, as defined by low birth and death rates and high
life expectancies. Many other developed countries and also a few developing
countries show definite movements towards stationary populations.
 </p>

<p>
In many developing countries, both the rate and momentum of population
growth have been such as to produce continuous absolute increases in
population every year. Even if it were possible to reduce fertility to replacement
levels, the momentum of the population would cause it to grow for
many years. This is due to the predominance of a young age structure in
most developing countries, which means that the number of couples entering
their reproductive years will, for a considerable time, remain greater
than the number moving out of that age group. Thus, the number of births
will continue to be large and exceed the numbers of deaths.
 </p>

<p>
However, regional differences exist. In East Asia, South—east Asia, Central
America and the Caribbean, there have actually been marked declines in
population growth rates. In Africa, by contrast, there has actually been an
increase in population growth rate over the last decade. It is estimated that
about 86 per cent of the world’s people will be living in today’s developing
countries when the global population reaches its stationary level. Several
developing countries will double, triple or quadruple their populations
over the next 50—60 years. Africa’s relative share of the world population is
expected to more than double during the same period (World Bank 1984).
 </p>

<p>
Given the current leVels of mortality, life expectancy— the number of
years a typical individual can expect to live— has increased greatly since 1950
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000254">254</pagenum>

<p>
and is expected to improve in the future. On a global level, life expectancy
increased from 45.8 years during 1950—55 to 58.9 years during 1980—85, and
according to the UN projections, it is expected to reach 70 by the year 2025.
Present life expectancy in the more developed countries averaged 73 during
1980—85 and in the less developed regions, it was 56.6; the estimates for 2025
are 77.2 and 68.9, respectively. In general, life expectancy is closely related to
economic well-being. The relationship that holds for infant mortality is such
that the countries having the lowest incomes and have the highest mortality
rates, while the wealthier countries have lower mortality.
 </p>

<p>
Population growth is outpacing the capacity of a number of developing
countries to provide for their economic and social well-being. The pressures
thus generated are depleting the natural resources faster than they
can be regenerated and reducing their productivity, hence undermining the
development.
 </p>

<p>
There is no simple correlation between population and environment.
Population, environment and development factors interact in different Ways
in different places. Not only the pace of development, but also its content,
location and the distribution of its benefits determine, in good measure, the
state of the environment. These factors also influence the growth and distribution
of population. Environmental resources provide the basis for development
just as the environmental factor constitute a part of the improvement
in the quality of life that development is meant to bring about. Similarly, the
size of population, the rate of its growth and the pattern of its distribution
influence the state of the environment, just as they condition the pace and
composition of development.
 </p>

<p>
The rates of economic growth appeared to be satisfactory in some
developing countries; they did not necessarily bring about noticeable
improvements in the levels of living of the majority of their people. In many
developing countries, environmental conditions in rural as well as urban
areas have deteriorated as their populations have grown. Generally speaking,
the quantity and quality of their natural resources, which provide the
foundation for sustained development, have steadily declined (World Bank
1984).
 </p>

<p>
According to Graf and Driskell (2009), the relationship between population
growth and the environment is complex. Much research focuses on
population size. Malthusian theory is often the theoretical basis for much
of the investigation. Specifically, Malthusian demographers speculate that
the population may be becoming too large for the food supply. Research
seeking to support or disprove Malthus’s theory is not conclusive; consequently,
some researchers maintain that the relationship between population
and environment is much more complex (Curran 2002). Human ecologists,
for instance, argue that population growth, density, and structure are also
important factors when explaining this relationship (Catton 1980; Dietz and

<p>
 Rosa 1994; Duncan 1959; Harrison 1993). Population distribution is particularly
important as our world becomes increasingly urban. Urban growth
happens through natural increase, internal and international migration
and boundary redefinition. This chapter focuses on theories of population
growth and the subsequent effects on the global environment.
</p>

<p>
ECOLOGICAL THEORIES

In 1798, Thomas Malthus in The Principles of Population was concerned with
overpopulation. The role of population size and growth were prominent in
his theory.
</p>

<p>
This natural inequality of the two powers of population and of production
in the earth and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep
their effects equal form the great difficulty that to me appears insurmountable
in the way to perfectibility of society (Malthus 1798: 97).
</p>

<p>
Malthus claimed that the population increased geometrically and the subsistence
(food supply) increased arithmetically. The subsistence for survival is
finite and limited. Overpopulation created a problem with the food supply
and the inability to sustain the current population. The blame was placed
on population size for shortages in the means for subsistence. Malthus predicted
a series of crises known as ‘positive checks’, including war, famine,
pestilence and poverty. Malthus’ methods to avoid the predicted doom and
gloom of overpopulation included ‘preventive checks’ on population growth
and ‘moral restraint’ to decrease birth rates, and thus decrease population
growth (Yaukey and Anderton 2001). The main issue for most Malthusians
centres on resources and food supply (i.e., depletion of natural resources) by
population growth (Weinstein and Pillai 2001).
</p>

<p>
Neo-Malthusians contend that the global population is increasing too
quickly and that the earth is already reaching the critical ecological limits.
At the core of the perspective, neo—Malthusians adhere to the belief that the
world would be a better place if fewer people existed. The force of the everincreasing
population will eventually lead to depletion of resources and environmental
degradation. With the given situation of rapid population growth,
human suffering will increase with food shortages and rising rates of poverty
(Trovato 2002). Contemporary neo—Malthusians stress the negative impacts
of population increases on the environment and the standard of living.
</p>

<p>
A large and growing population is regarded as the principal determinant
of poverty, water pollution, deforestation, degradation of air quality, and
all other forms of environmental stress. As population size increases, it is
argued, renewable resources are consumed at a pace faster than they can be
replace (Weinstein and Pillai 2001: 374).
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000256">256</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 256
</h1>
<p>
The opposing side of the Malthusian perspective includes criticisms of the
pessimistic view of global population increase. Many critics of Malthus
assume that his predictions were overblown. Julian Simon (1981), a noted
anti—Malthusian, generally argues that population growth and increased
population size are beneficial. Simon contends that humans are the greatest
resource and the historic growth of the population highlights the
success of humanity. Population growth creates diversity, innovation, specialization
and economic activity. Due to these effects of a growing population,
the standard of living has increased (Trovato 2002). Simon states
that the effects of population size on the environment are misunderstood
and the negative environmental effects are dependent on social and economic
conditions (Simon 1981). While debates among Malthusians, neo-
Malthusians and anti-Malthusians continue, the impact of Malthus’ work
cannot be ignored.
</p>

<p>
Overpopulation and carrying capacity are two of the most researched
topics involving demography and the environment. Concerns include having
enough food to sustain the world’s population as well as the inevitable
depletion of non-renewable energy resources.
</p>

<p>
Gold (2002) illustrates the problem of overpopulation in Third World
countries. The population of Africa is the fastest growing the world due to
a high fertility level and a moderately high mortality level. Nigeria is the
most populated country of that continent, and its population is expected to
double from 2000 to 2025. While some countries are quickly approaching
overpopulation, some are dealing with the consequences already.
</p>

<p>
For instance, China has the largest population in the world; although,
unlike Africa, its growth rate has recently slowed. An economic boom,
which began in China the 1950s, led the way for population growth. As the
population began to overload the urban areas, migration and fertility policies
Were put in place to discourage migration into cities and having large
families. However, by the time these Chinese policies were implemented,
the population was so large that a small percentage of growth translated into
a large increase in actual numbers. Specifically, the Chinese population is
growing by 5 million people a year.
</p>

<p>
India's population IS also growing rapidly. It is the second largest country
in the world. Although less than 30 per cent of the population live in urban
areas, India is still has many large cities. Mumbai is now its largest city. The
population in that city tripled between 1970 and 2000, which makes it the
second largest urban area in the world with 18.1 million people. As with
most urban growth, the economy was growing which increased the need for
workers in the city and more buildings, all of this congestion impacting the
environment (Gold 2002).
</p>

<p>
What these rapidly increasing populations of China, Africa and India
have in common is urbanization. The majority of the recent growth of
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000257">257</pagenum>

Page no: 257
</h1>
<p>
urbanization is in Third World cities. There is a debate as to whether this
increase is similar to what developed countries experienced a hundred
years earlier. Some argue that the increase in these cities is similar to that
in Western cities in the nineteenth century (Kasarda and Crenshaw 1991).
Comparing the population growth of industrial cities between 1875 and
1900 and developing cities between 1975 and 2000, the increase in developing
cities is similar to that of the past increase of industrial cities but the sheer
numbers are higher (O’Meara 1999). This is due to the fact that the Western
nations have already gone through the demographic transition while Third
World countries are in it or about to be in it.
</p>

<p>
The world as a whole is becoming increasingly urban. By 2030, 5 billion
people, 61 per cent of the projected world population, will be living in cities
(Hunter 2000). This high percentage of the population living in urban areas
has not always existed. In 1850, there were only three cities that had more
than 1 million residents— Paris, London and Beijing— and about 100 cities
had more than 1,00,000 residents (Golden 1981). Therefore, people were
spread out all over the globe. At the turn of the century, in fact, this was
still true. In 1900, less than 14 per cent of the world’s population lived in
cities (Brown and Jacobson 1987). However, midway through the twentieth
century, a major shift began. In 1950, 30per cent of the world, was considered
urban. In 2000, more than 45 per cent of the world’s population was
urban. (United Nations Population Division 2002). This shift is projected
to continue. That is, most people will live in urban areas in the future. Gold
(2002) warns, ‘But such uncontrollable population increases, of course, lead
to over- urbanization, which has been described as a condition which urban
areas cannot adequately cope with all of the needs or water supplies, sanitation
and sewage systems, health care, and other necessary services and institutions
are overtaxed (p. 379). The environment is affected by increases in
urbanization.
</p>

<p>
In order to preserve our environment for the present and for the future,
it is important to understand ecological theories and population dynamics.
The ecological theories explain the population growth, density and structure
as important determinants in the relationship with the environment.
Understanding the rapid growth of population and overpopulation in Third
World cities sheds light on the crisis occurring with the environment.
</p>

<p>
Rapid urbanization has been sustained by the combination of high
rates of natural population increase and rural to urban migration. The
relative contribution of each to urban population growth varies, but in the
majority of cities, natural increases are the primary contributing factor.
However, the two sources are intertwined, as a large proportion of those
leaving the countryside are in their reproductive years and therefore may
be partly responsible for the high rates of natural population increase in
urban centres.

<p>
The increasing concentration of people in urban centres has strained the
capacity of most governments to provide basic services. Illegal settlements
(e.g., slums, squatter settlements, etc.) are common. In such areas, people
are usually deprived of access to the basic facilities like drinking water,
waste disposal, etc. They are frequently forced to use open water for washing,
cleaning, etc., and to dispose waste in unhygienic ways and to live in
makeshift shelters surrounded by accumulating domestic waste. Unhygienic
living conditions in slums often spread diseases such as typhoid, cholera,
malaria and hepatitis through entire settlement.
</p>

<p>
Low incomes and weak purchasing power are manifestation of the poverty
that characterizes most families living in slums and squatter settlements.
The cause of this poverty lies in the lack of sufficient opportunities for steady
and gainful employment. The major problem for most families is underemployment
and the low, fluctuating incomes that this entails.
</p>

<p>
People in the crowded squatter settlements in the developing areas are
most prone to the effects of natural disaster: floods, tropical cyclones, etc.
(El-Hinnawi 1985). While population growth has slowed down, the absolute
number of people continues to increase— by about 1 billion every 13 years.
Slowing population growth would help improve living standards and would
buy time to protect natural resources. Without stabilizing the population
size, higher living standards will not be sustained. In every environmental
sphere, circumstances have either failed or are worsening. For example, in
case of public health in the developing countries, more than 12 million people
each year become the victims of poor environmental needs like unclean
water, poor sanitation, etc. Air pollution contaminates and kills nearly 3 million
more. Industrial wastes and other contaminants also cause extensive
health hazards. In case of food supply, particularly in 64 of the 105 developing
countries studied by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the
population has been mounting faster than food supplies. Population pressures
have tainted nearly 2 billion hectares of arable land. The demand of
freshwater is soaring as the population is increasing. The projection report
states that by 2025, when world population will be 8 billion, 48 countries
containing 3 billion people will face scarcities.
</p>

<p>
It is reported by Population Reference Bureau (2006) that the world’s 10
largest countries in population are China (1311 millions), India (1122 millions),
USA (299 millions), Indonesia (225 millions), Brazil (187 millions), Pakistan
(166 millions), Bangladesh (147 millions), Russia (142 millions), Nigeria (135
millions) and Japan (128 millions). Of the top 15 HIV/AIDS prevalence countries,
Swaziland (33.4 per cent population affected), Botswana (24.1 per cent),
Lesotho (23.2 per cent), Zimbabwe (20.1 per cent), Namibia (19.6 per cent),
South Africa (18.8 per cent), Zambia (17.0 per cent), Mozambique (16.1 per
cent) and Malawi (11.8 per cent) show a high trend of eco-health hazards.
On our planet, protected areas are an indicator of development that mainly

contributes to the environmental sustainability by maintaining a balance with
biodiversity. It safeguards planet’s genetic and biotic resources, prevents soil—
erosion and supports local living. Of the world the countries that share high—
est of their surface area protected are Venezuela, China, Hong Kong, Zambia,
Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Guatemala, Germany, Switzerland, etc.
</p>

<p>
Many steps toward sustainability can be taken today. These include
‘using energy more efficiently; managing cities better; phasing out subsidies
that encourage waste; managing water resources and protecting fresh water
sources; harvesting forest prodUCts rather than destroying forests;
preserving arable land and increasing food production through a second
Green Revolution; managing coastal zones and ocean fisheries; protecting
biodiversity hotspots; and adopting an international convention on climate
change.’ Environment will be getting worse if we fail to stabilize the growth
of population. It is evident from different statistical sources and literatures
that about 3 million die from pollution each year. In the past decade, in every
ecological sector, conditions have either failed to improve are worsening.
Unclean water, along with poor sanitation, kills over 12 million people each
year, many in the developing countries. Air pollution kills nearly 3 million
more. Heavy metals and other contaminants also cause widespread health
problems. Amount of land lost to farming by degradation equals two- thirds
of North America. In 64 of the 105 developing countries studied by the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization, the population has been growing faster
than food supplies. Population presSures have degraded some 2 billion hectares
of arable land—an area the size of Canada and the USA. The supply
of freshwater is finite, but demand is soaring with rises in population and
use per capita. By 2025, when world population is projected to be 8 billion,
48 countries containing 3 billion people will face shortages. Half of all coastal
ecosystems are pressured by high population densities and urban development.
A tide of pollution is rising in the world’s seas. Ocean fisheries are
being overexploited, and fish catches are down.
</p>

<p>
Nearly half of the world’s original forest cover has been lost, and each
year another 16 million hectares are cut, bulldozed or burned. Forests prOVide
over US$400 billion to the world economy annually and are Vital to
maintain healthy ecosystems. Yet, current demand for forest products may
exceed the limit of sustainable consumption by 25 per cent.
</p>

<p>
It is also evident that two— thirds of the world’s species are in decline. The
earth’s biological diversity is crucial to the continued vitality of agriculture
and medicine— and perhaps even to life on earth itself. Yet, human activities
are pushing many thousands of plant and animal species into extinction.
Two of every three species are estimated to be in decline. The earth’s
surface is warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, largely from burning
fossil fuels. If the global temperature rises as projected, sea levels Would rise
by several meters, causing widespread flooding. Global warming also could

<p>
cause droughts and disrupt agriculture. It is suggested by the experts that
many steps toward sustainability can be taken. These include, using energy
more efficiently, managing cities better, phasing out subsidies that encourage
waste, etc. and ‘the world must sustain 1 billion more people every
13 years. While population growth has slowed, the absolute number of people
continues to increase— by about 1 billion every 13 years. Slowing population
growth would help improve living standards and would buy time to protect
natural resources. In the long run, to sustain higher living standards, world
population size must stabilize. Less growth of population will provide time
to solve sustainability problems. Environmentalists and economists increasingly
agree that efforts to protect the environment and to achieve better living
standards can be closely linked and are mutually reinforcing. Slowing
the increase in population, especially in the face of rising per capita demand
for natural resources, can take pressure off the environment and buy time
to improve living standards on a sustainable basis. As population growth
slows, countries can invest more in education, health care, job creation, and
other improvements that help boost living standards. In turn, as individual
income, savings, and investment rise, more resources become available that
can boost productivity. This dynamic process has been identified as one of
the key reasons that the economies of many Asian countries grew rapidly
between 1960 and 1990.’
</p>

<p>
A vibrant economy needs slower population growth. In recent years, fertility
has been falling in many developing countries and, as a result, annual
world population growth has fallen to about 1.4 per cent in 2000 compared
to about 2 per cent in 1960. The UN estimated recently that population is
growing by about 78 million per year, down from about 90 million estimated
early in the 1990s. Still, at the current pace, world population increases by
about 1 billion every 13 years. World population surpassed 6 billion in 1999
and is projected to rise to over 8 billion by 2025.

Age- dependency   : The ratio of persons in the ages defined as dependent
Ratio          	(under 15 years and over 64 years) to persons in the
               	ages defined as economically productive (15—64 years)
               	in a population.


Age— Sex Structure   : The composition of a population as determined by the
                   	number or proportion of males and females in each
                   	age category. The age— sex structure of a population is
                   	the cumulative result of past trends in fertility, mortality
                   	and migration. Information on age— sex composition
                   	is essential for the description and analysis
                   	of many other types of demographic data. See also
                   	Population Pyramid.


Age- specific Rate   : Rate obtained for specific age groups (e,g., age— specific
                   	fertility rate, death rate, marriage rate, illiteracy rate or
                   	school enrolment rate).

Ageing of        	:  A process in which the proportions of adults and elderly
Population         	increase in a population, while the proportions of children
                   	and adolescents decrease. This process reSults
                   	in a rise in the median age of the population. Ageing
                   	occurs when fertility rates decline while life expectancy
                   	remains constant or improves at the older ages.

Birth Control   	:  Practices employed by couples that permit sexual
                   	intercourse with reduced likelihood of conception
                   	and birth. The term birth control is often used synonymously
                   	with such terms as contraception, fertility
                   	control and family planning. But, birth control
                   	includes abortion to prevent a birth, whereas family
                   	planning methods explicitly do not include abortion.


Birth Rate (or  	:  The number of live births per 1000 population in a
Crude Birth Rate)  	given year. Not to be confused with the growth rate.

Census          	:  A canvass of a given area, resulting in an enumeration
                   	of the entire population and often the compilation of
                   	other demographic, social and economic information
                   	pertaining to that population at a specific time.

Childbearing Years : The reproductive age span of women, assumed for statistical
                 	purposes to be 15-44 or 15—49 years of age.

Ratio              	between ages 15-44 or 15—49 in a population in a
                   	given year. This crude fertility measure, based on basic
                   	census data, is sometimes used when more specific
                   	fertility information is not available.

Contraceptive  	:  Percentage of couples currently using a contraceptive
Prevalence        	method.

Crude Rate      	: Rate of any demographic event computed for an entire
                  	population.

Death Rate (or  	: The number of deaths per 1000 population in a given
Crude Death Rate) 	year.


De Facto Method	: In this method, census data is collected on a particular
                 	day.

De Jure Method 	:  In this method, information is collected from every
                  	household in a particular area.

Demographic    	:  The historical shift of birth and death rates from high
Transition        	to low levels in a population. The decline of mortality
                  	usually precedes the decline in fertility, thus resulting
                  	in rapid population growth during the transition
                  	period.

Demography    	:   The scientific study of human populations, including
                  	their sizes, compositions, distributions, densities,
                  	growth and other characteristics, as well as the causes
                  	and consequences of changes in these factors.

Dependency Ratio  :   The ratio of the economically dependent part of the
                  	population to the productive part; arbitrarily defined
                  	as the ratio of the elderly (ages 65 and older) plus the
                  	young (below age 15) to the population in the working
                  	ages (ages 15—64).

Emigration    	:   The process of leaving one country to take up permanent
                  	or semi-permanent reSidence in another.

Family        	: Usually, two or more persons living together and
                	related by birth, marriage or adoption. Families may
                	consist of siblings or other relatives as well as married
                	couples and any children they have.

Family Planning   : The conscious effort of couples to regulate the number
                	and spacing of births through artificial and natural
                	methods of contraception. Family planning connotes
                	conception control to avoid pregnancy and abortion,
                	but it also includes efforts of couples to induce
                	pregnancy.

Fecundity    	: The physiological capacity of a woman to produce a
               	child.

                 	of dying at each age (or age group) for a given population,
                 	according to the age- specific death rates prevailing
                 	at that time. The life table gives an organized and
                	complete picture of a population’s mortality.


Malthus, Thomas R  : English clergyman and economist famous for his
(1766— 1834)     	theory (expounded in the ‘Essay on the Principle of
                 	Population’) state that the world’s population tends to
                 	increase faster than the food supply and that unless
                 	fertility is controlled (by late marriage or celibacy),
                 	famine, disease and war must serve as natural population

                   	if she were to pass through her childbearing years
                   	conforming to the age— specific fertility rates of a given
                   	year. This rate is sometimes stated as the number of
                   	children women are having today. See also Gross
                   	Reproduction Rate and Net Reproduction Rate.



Urban            	:  Countries differ in the way they classify population as
                   	‘urban’ or ‘rural’. Typically, a community or settlement
                    	with a population of 2000 or more is considered urban.
                    	A listing of country definitions is published annually
                    	in the United Nations Demographic Yearbook.


Urbanization     	: Growth in the proportion of a population living in
                   	urban areas.

Vital Statistics 	:  Demographic data on births, deaths, foetal deaths,
                     	marriages and divorces.
