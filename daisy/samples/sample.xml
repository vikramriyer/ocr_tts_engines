<h1>Preface,Page no:13</h1>
<p>
Every author remains keen to know how his book is received by students,
teachers and the public when it is released in the market. Within a few months
of publishing Social Problems in India in 1992, we received some good news
and some bad news. The good news was that students, teachers, as well as the
public seemed to like the book and also that the book was well received in
some western countries too, while the bad news was that a separate paper on
“Social Problems” was not prescribed in all the universities either at the
postgraduate level or at the undergraduate level. Surprisingly enough, it was
also gathered that the book is extensively read by those candidates who appear
in central and state level civil services competitive examinations. One
comment received was that though the book describes, explains, evaluates and
even theorizes, wherever necessary, on the important social problems in our
country certain paragraphs openly criticizing the political rulers be avoided in
academics, while other comment was that some more problems be included in
the book so that students find all prescribed topics in one book. The nature of
the social problems discussed was also such as warranted that the book be
updated every two-three years to remain current and useful. It was, therefore,
decided to revise the book at the earliest.</p>
<p>
     Revising a textbook such as this is a humbling experience. There is no
end of ideas on any problem in society. Besides, new measures are taken by
the government over the years for containing the problems. On content,
there is more disagreement about what is needed. Some students and teachers
feel that there should be an expanded coverage of statistics, while others hold
that giving figures and statistics should be eliminated altogether. I felt that
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00014">14</pagenum>
<h1>xiv 0 Preface,Page no:14</h1>
<p>
there is no right or wrong position in disagreements such as these. There are
only differences in what are liked or disliked in different academic settings. I,
therefore, decided to make such changes in the book as may only enhance the
academic importance of the contents. </p>
<p>
     What distinguishes this edition from the previous one is that I have
added chapters on three new problems (Corruption, Bonded Labour, and
AIDS), updated the data on every problem, and added new arguments and
comments wherever necessary, reflecting new developments. All chapters are
thus discussed in greater depth than before. I think, students will find the
addition of about two hundred more pages useful and valuable, appreciating
the importance of clear and logical thinking and a more rigorous issue-based
analysis.</p>

<h1>Preface to the Third Edition,Page no:15</h1>
<p>
This is the third edition of the book. Over the years, the book has become
a well-established text in the field of sociology. The revised edition of this
popular book explains why it is so important to understand social
problems in India. After its first publication in 1992, this best-selling text,
written by an influential academic-practitioner, has established itself as the
standard and authenticated source for not only students pursuing under-
graduate and postgraduate courses in sociology, but also for thousands of
aspirants preparing for competitive examinations, particularly civil
services examinations, conducted by public service commissions. Since its
first publication, it is widely regarded as the leading book in the field as it
combines theoretical rigour with an authoritative overview of relevant and
up-to-date research. </p>
<p>
For this new edition coverage has been expanded from 20 to 25 chapters,
and has been thoroughly updated to include all new developments in the field.
This edition has been extensively revised, expanded and updated, incorpo-
rating discussions of some contemporary social problems too, such as honour
killings, acid attacks, farmers’suicides, cyber crime, domestic violence, ageing and
elder abuse, tribal unrest, and globalization and consumerism. However, it is
virtually a new book and will be of immense value to all including those who
have read its previous versions. </p>
<p>
In the absence of our late father, who had authored this book, the task of
revision/updation has been very meticulously handled by the publisher’s
in-house editorial team under the leadership of Mr K.K. Parnami, Chief
Production Editor. We are thankful to them all. In most of the cases, as far as </p>

<h1>xvi 0 Preface to the Third Edition,Page no:16</h1>
<p>
possible, the latest data/ information has been made available. But, still, we feel
that there might be some shortcomings for which we are solely responsible.
We shall be thankful if these are brought to our notice so that the next edition
of this important book could be improved keeping them in view. </p>

Social Problems: Concept and
Approaches,Page no:17</h1>
<p>
Today, ‘Social Problems’ is considered a sub—discipline of Sociology.
Sociology is a very vast field, encompassing such sub-disciplines as the
sociology of family, sociology of crime and delinquency, sociology of
education, sociology of environment, etc.</p>
<p>
    Drug abuse, alcoholism, ageing, population explosion, corruption,
AIDS, inequality, child abuse, terrorism, pollution, poverty, environmental
degradation, unemployment and crime against women are not individual
problems but affect the society at large. An individual problem is one which
affects one individual or one group. Its resolution lies within the immediate
milieu of the individual/ group. Against this, a societal issue is one which
affects the society as a whole, or the larger part of society. The sociologist’s job
is to understand the complexity of these problems and their relatedness to
social structure, to study the operation of varied patterns of interrelationships
in the society and how people are affected by them, and observe how social
systems need to be reorganized and restructured in dealing with them.</p>

<h1>The Concept of Social Problem</h1>
<p>
A social problem is a condition or set of events that some people in society
view as being undesirable. A social problem has been defined as “a situation
confronting a group or a section of society which inflicts injurious conse-
quences that can be handled only collectively” (Reinhardt, 1952: 14). Thus, no
one individual or a few individuals are responsible for the appearance of a
socially problematic situation, and the control of this situation is also beyond
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00018">18</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:18</h1>
<p>
the ability of one person or a few persons. This responsibility is placed upon
society at large. Walsh and Furfey (1961: 1) have defined a social problem as a
“deviation from the social ideal remediable by group effort”. Two elements
are important in this definition: (i) a situation which is less than ideal, that is,
which is undesirable or abnormal; and (ii) one which is remediable by
collective effort. Though it is not easy to determine which situation is ideal
and which is not, and there is no definite standard which could be used to
judge it, yet it is clear that a social ideal is not something arbitrary and the
term ‘social problem’ is applied only to that ‘issue’ which social ethics (which
describes human conduct as right and wrong in group relations), and society
(which is concerned with the promotion of the common good or the welfare
of its members and the preservation of public order) consider as unfavourable.
The ‘issue’ should also be such as is beyond an individual to handle it by
himself. If an individual wants a job and has to compete with others for
getting it, then it is merely an individual problem. Likewise, if an individual
has become addicted to drugs and has to seek admission to a psychiatric
institute or a community centre for deaddiction, that is his/ her personal
problem. On the other hand, if 35 million persons are unemployed in villages
and cities in a country, and no single individual can do anything effective
about it, what is needed to solve the problem is an organized group or social
effort. Thus, a problem may be an individual problem under one set of
circumstances and a social problem under another. </p>
<p>
     But social problems change with the passage of time. What was not
considered a social problem a few decades ago may become a crucial social
problem today or two decades later. For example, the population explosion in
our country was not viewed as a social problem up to the late 40s of the 20th
century but from the early 1950s it has come to be perceived as a very crucial
socio-economic problem. Social change creates new conditions in which an
issue comes to be identified as a social problem. Similarly, youth unrest in
India was not a problem upto the 1940s but in the 1950s and the 1960s it
became a problem and in the 1970s and the 1980s it became a very serious one
and continues to be so even today.</p>
 <p>
     Let us examine a few more viewpoints on the concept of ‘social
problem’. Fuller and Myers (1941: 320) have defined a social problem as “a
condition which is defined by a considerable number of persons as a deviation
from some social norms which they cherish”. Merton and Nisbet (1971: 184)
hold that a social problem is “a way of behaviour that is regarded by a
substantial part of a social order as being in violation of one or more generally
accepted or approved norms”. This definition may apply to some problems
like alcoholism, corruption and communalism, but not to problems like</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00019">19</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:19</h1>
<p>
population explosion. Some problems are created not by the abnormal and
deviant behaviour of the individuals but by the normal and accepted
behaviour. Raab and Selznick (1959: 32) maintain that a social problem is “a
problem in human relationships which seriously threatens society or impedes
the important aspirations of many people”. According to Carr (1955: 306), “a
social problem exists whenever we become conscious of a difficulty, a gap
between our preferences and reality”. Blumer (1971: 19) writes that “social
problems involve actions or patterns of behaviour that are viewed by a
substantial number of persons in the society as being deleterious to the society
or in violation of societal norms, and about which ameliorative action is seen
as both possible and desirable”. Landis (1959) is of the opinion that “social
problems are men’s unfulfilled aspirations for welfare”. Case (1976: 310) has
said that “a social problem refers to any situation which attracts the attention
of a considerable number of competent observers within a society and appeals
to them as calling for readjustment or remedy by social (that is, collective)
action of some kind or other”.</p>
<p>
    Horton and Leslie (1970: 4) write that a social problem is “a condition
affecting a significant number of people in ways considered undesirable, about
which it is felt that something can be done through collective social action”.
Though this definition emphasizes that a social problem is a condition
“affecting a significant number of people” it does not give the exact number of
people who must be affected. It only points out that ‘enough people’ should
be affected so that notice is taken of it and people begin to talk and write
about it. One way of ‘measuring public concern’ about a condition is to assess
the number of articles devoted to it in popular magazines. Thus, the problem
of ‘environmental pollution’ in India was not taken up earnestly till the
beginning of the 1980s, manifested by the fact that not many articles appeared
on this issue in newspapers and magazines. The appearance of numerous
articles in the last twenty years or so indicates that the condition has attracted
widespread consideration, and has become a social problem.</p>
<p>
Another element in the definition which needs attention is “in ways
considered undesirable”. The custom of sati in India was not a social problem
as long as most people thought it was desirable. When Raja Ram Mohan Roy
took initiative and a considerable number of people came to support him and
started criticizing the practice as harmful and awful, only then did the custom
turn into a social problem. In recent times, it was only after the incident of
Roop Kanwar, a 21-year-old Rajput girl, who committed sati on the funeral
pyre of her husband in Deorala in Sikar district in Rajasthan in September
1987 that this practice came to be condemned, and an Act was passed in
February 1988 in the state of Rajasthan prescribing serious penalty for persons
forcing a woman to commit sati.</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00020">20</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:20</h1>
<p>
   A social problem, thus, involves a value judgement, a feeling that a
condition is detrimental and requires change. Political corruption came to be
viewed as a social problem only after the 1970s, though it was prevalent in our
country earlier too. Issues like wife battering and child abuse are yet to be
accepted as serious social problems.</p>
<p>
   Conditions that cannot be changed or evaded are also not accepted as
social problems. Thus, famine was not considered a social problem until
recently because of the widespread belief that the scantiness of rains was the
result of the wrath of the rain-god. Today, famine in states like Rajasthan is
viewed as a social problem and is seen to be the result of the failure on the part
of government to complete the Rajasthan Canal because of the scarcity of
economic resources and such similar reasons. The scarcity of drinking water
became a social problem only when it was realized that it was not a
misfortune to be endured but “something could be done” to remove this
scarcity. Thus, it is the belief and hope in the possibility of prevention and
treatment that causes people to consider situation as a social problem.</p>
<p>
    The last portion in the definition of Horton and Leslie is ‘collective
action’. A social problem cannot be solved by an individual or a few
individuals. All social problems are social in treatment, that is, it is believed
that they can be tackled only by public concern, discussion, opinion
formation and pressure.</p>
<p>
   According to Weinberg (1960: 4), social problems are “behaviour patterns
or conditions which arise from social processes and are considered so objec-
tionable or undesirable by many members of a society that they recognize that
corrective policies, programmes and services are necessary to cope with them”.
Weinberg gives six characteristics of social problems as under:</p>
<p>
1. Social problems arise by being collectively defined as objectionable by
many members of the community. Thus, adverse conditions not defined
by the community as reprehensible are not considered as social
problems. For example, if taking alcohol is not regarded as objectionable
by society, it is not considered a social problem. But as society recog-
nizes and discusses the problems inherent in alcohol consumption,
studies its consequences and devises a plan of corrective action to control
it, it comes to be defined as a social problem even though the original
situation may not have changed.</p>
<p>
2. Social problems change when the concerned behavioural patterns are
interpreted differently. For example, till a few decades ago, mental illness
was viewed as insanity and it was considered so disgraceful that the
families kept the member’s mental illness a secret. Now, the behaviour
of a mentally-ill person is seen only as one type of ‘deviant behaviour’ </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00021">21</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:21</h1>
<p>
   which requires psychiatric and social treatment. Thus, the problem of
   mental illness today is met more realistically and effectively.</p>
<p>
3. Mass media (newspapers, internet, television, radio, movies) play an
   important role in creating awareness about the scope and urgency of
   social problems.
4. Social problems have to be viewed in the context of society’s values and
   institutions; for example, the problem of racial conflict in the United
   States is different from the problem of untouchability in India.
5. Social problems need to be analysed in terms of the influences upon
   them by group processes and social relationships.
6. Since social problems vary historically, contemporary social problems
   are the society’s concern, that is, the problem of refugee settlement in
   India in 1947—48 was different from the problem of settling refugees
   from Assam in 1968, or the Tamils from Sri Lanka in 1988—89, or the
   Indians from Kuwait and Iraq in September 1990. Similarly, the problem
   of immigrants in the United Kingdom in 1988 was different than it was
   in 1967 or 1947.</p>

<h1>Characteristics of Social Problems</h1>
<p>
On the basis of the above definitions, we can identify the following character-
istics of social problems:</p>
<p>
 .   All social problems are situations which have injurious consequences
     for society.

 .   All social problems are deviations from the ‘ideal’ Situation.

 .   All social problems have some common basis of origin.

 .   All social problems are social in origin.

 .   All social problems are caused by pathological social conditions.

 .   All social problems are interconnected.

 .   All social problems are social in their results, that is, they affect all
     sections of society.

 .   The responsibility for social problems is social, that is, they require a
     collective approach for their solution.

 .   All social problems occur in all societies.</p>

<h1> Reactions to Social Problems</h1>
<p>
Different people react differently to social problems. The differences may be
explained in terms of the following four factors:
(i) An attitude of unconcern: Many people remain indifferent to a
problem thinking that it does not affect them. Sometimes their own
individual problems like family tensions and job pressures keep them so</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00022">22</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:22</h1>
<p>
engaged that they do not find time to be interested in what affects others.It is
only when their own interests are involved that they become agitated and
start taking interest in the problem.</p>
<p>
(ii) Fatalism: Some people are so fatalistic that they attribute everything
to destiny. Issues like poverty and unemployment are explained in terms of
misfortunes and past karma. They, therefore, suffer the misfortune quietly
and wait for some miracle to happen.</p>
<p>
(iii) Vested interest: Some people take no interest in the existing problems
because they stand to gain so long as the problem exists. Motivated by
self-interest, they describe the problem as insoluble and talk about its eradi-
cation as a waste of time.</p>
<p>
(iv) Absence of expert knowledge: Some people, though deeply concerned
about the problem, do not take much interest in it believing that its solution is
impossible unless people change their attitudes and values. As the changes
must be initiated by a change in outlook, they remain unconcerned about
finding alternative possibilities of treatment. Dowry is one such problem in
our society.</p>
<p>
   Some people have incorrect, unreliable and superficial knowledge or
fallacies about social problems. We can point out eight such feelings.</p>
<p>
   One, it is wrong to believe that there is agreement among all people on
the nature of the social problems. For example, some people think that drug
abuse is a social problem in India while others are convinced on the basis of
the empirical studies conducted in different parts of the country pointing out
to the low magnitude of drug abuse, that it cannot be perceived as a social
problem. Similarly, for some people in India, untouchability is no longer a
social problem after the measures adopted since independence to emancipate
the Harijans, whereas for others, it is still a social problem. They even refer to
the harassment and beating up of the Harijans who were prevented from
entering the Nathdwara temple in Rajasthan in September 1988 which
provoked the then President of India Shri R. Venkataraman to declare that he
was willing to lead a procession of Harijans to enter the Nathdwara temple.
Thus, on some problems there may be complete agreement and on others
there may be little agreement as to their existence. </p>
<p>
   Two, it is fallacious to believe that social problems are caused by nature
and are, therefore, inevitable. In fact, no social problem is beyond human
control if certain social arrangements are changed.</p>
<p>
   Three, it is a misnomer to believe that social problems are caused by
selfish, brutal, exploitative and indifferent people or by the wilful wickedness
of a few. In fact, many problems are caused by the good people because they
either mind their own business or they remain indifferent and callous to
certain issues. For example, the growth of slums which promotes family</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00023">23</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:23 </h1>
<p>
disorganization and increases certain kinds of crime is the result of the
callousness of rich persons and politicians. However, these people do not have
any ‘evil motive’ in their indifference or thinking and behaviour. It may,
therefore, be said that a social problem is the product of certain social
practices and not of wilful wickedness of certain individuals.</p>
<p>
     Four, it is wrong to believe that social problems are created by talking
about them. The problems are caused not because people irresponsibly talk
about them and thus incite others or stir up trouble or evoke hatred and so
on. In fact, people are often mobilized to solve problems and initiate action
against the factors that perpetuate the problem. </p>
<p>
     Five, it is incorrect to assume that all people like to see the social
problems solved, for example, the conservative Brahmins may not be inter-
ested in taking up the issue of untouchability for discussion; or many
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward castes/ classes people
may prefer to remain ‘backward’ for fear of losing out on the reservation
benefits; or many capitalists may not be in favour of full employment for fear
of not getting adequate workers at low wages; or many landlords may not be
interested in constructing more houses and reducing the problem of housing
shortage for fear of getting low rents; or owners of one-room tenements in
slum areas may not be interested in slum clearance because of their vested
interests. Thus, a sizeable number of people can be found to be disinterested in
solving social problems because of vested interests.</p>
<p>
     Six, it is not correct to believe that social problems if left on their own
will solve themselves. The feeling that time will solve all problems is unsound
and unrealistic in this age. It is only a rationalization for inactivity.It may,in
fact, aggravate the problems, especially problems like poverty, pollution and
population.</p>
<p>
     Seven, the feeling that unravelling facts will solve the problem is not
correct. Though it is true that no problem can be intelligently understood
without collecting complete facts about it, it is also true that without scientifi-
cally interpreting the gathered data, measures cannot be taken to solve a
problem. For example, the mere collection of the facts on the magnitude of
the problem of drug abuse among youth, the nature of drugs used by them,
the methods of using drugs, the sources of getting drugs and the withdrawal
syndromes will not help much in suggesting measures to control the drug
misuse unless we analyse and interpret facts like the reasons for taking drugs,
the role of peer group and the role of family in controlling drug abuse. Thus,
data in itself is nothing; it is the objective interpretation of the data which is
meaningful.</p>
<p>
    Eight, it is untrue to think that problems can be solved without institu-
tional changes. In a way, it is impossible to solve problems without planning,</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00024">24</pagenum>
<h1>Page no :24</h1>
<p>
 without structural changes, without adjustments and adaptations, or without
altering the existing institutions and practices. For example, we cannot
eradicate corruption unless people change their values and beliefs, the laws are
enacted, the courts set examples by giving retributive and deterrent
punishment to corrupt people in high positions, including corrupt politicians,
and so on. Many a time, a solution to one of the problems creates many new
problems to be solved. Since change in institutions and values comes slowly,
solving a problem is not easy and quick and takes considerable time.
Sometimes we succeed in changing some conditions and thus in partly
reducing the magnitude or the frequency of the problem. We may not be able
to eliminate crime completely but we can surely reduce the rate of crime in
society by checking the frustrations of people and providing them with alter-
natives to compensate failure in one field with success in another. It may not
be possible to eliminate family disorganization but it is surely possible to find
means to reduce tensions in family. Thus, it may not be possible to locate
solutions to all problems, but there are prospects of achieving some success in
reducing the personal suffering due to social problems. </p>

<h1> Causes of Social Problems</h1>
<p>
Social problems arise out of pathological social conditions. They occur in all
societies—simple (that is, small, isolated and homogeneous with a strong sense
of group solidarity, and which change slowly) as well as complex (which are
characterized by impersonal secondary relations, anonymity, loneliness, high
mobility and extreme specialization, and where change is faster). What it
means is that wherever and whenever a relationship is affected between a
group of individuals, it leads to maladjustments and conflicts. </p>
<p>
     Three factors are important in the understanding of the causal factors in
social problems: </p>
<p>
(1) The causal conditions are numerous. Broadly, the potential causes of
    social problems found in social environment are: (a) contradictions in
    social systems, (b) malfunctioning of economic systems, (c) lack of
    change in religious systems, and (d) defective functioning of political
    systems.
(2) Social problems provide a strong basis of common causal factors.
(3) Social problems are interrelated and interdependent in the sense that
    they are cumulatively promotive and provocative, that is, they foster
    and encourage one another.
    Reinhardt (1952: 7-12) has referred to three factors in the development
of social problems:</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00025">25</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:25</h1>
<p>
(i) Differentiation and multiplication of interests and functions
The principle that the greater the number of parts in a machine or an
organism, the greater will be the probability of maladjustment among the
parts, holds good for human societies too, where there is increased oppor-
tunity for the collision of interests of various individuals, groups, institutions
and systems. Untouchability, communal riots and political crimes are the
social problems which are the result of the clash of interests of different castes
and classes.</p>
<p>
(ii) Accelerating frequency of social change or growth of civilization
This has been made possible due to the multiplication of scientific and
mechanical innovations. For example, the invention of machines has
destroyed many old forms of employment resulting in the migration of
millions of people, and has given rise to class conflicts. It is, thus, the structural
and functional maladjustments arising from revolutionary inventions which
create many social problems.</p>
<p>
(iii) Man’s developed insight to make a scientific analysis
Ever since man has developed his social insight of looking into the working of
nature, issues which were formerly regarded as simple are now perceived as the
result of various kinds of natural conditions which influence man and society.</p>

<h1> Theoretical Approaches to Social Problems </h1>
<p>
Social problems have been analysed scientifically. Below we examine some of
the theoretical approaches which present universal explanations for all types
of social problems:</p>
<p>
Social Disorganization Approach
Social disorganization is a condition of a society, community or group in
which there is a breakdown of social control, or of a social order, or of formal
and informal norms that define permissible behaviour. It is characterized by
the lack of co-operation, common values, unity, discipline and predictability.
Warren (1949: 83—87) has described it as a condition involving (a) lack of
consensus (disagreement about group purposes), (b) lack of integration of
institutions (often working at cross purposes), and (c) inadequate means of
social control (preventing individuals from playing their individual roles due
to confusion). Elliott and Merrill (1950: 20) have defined it as a process by
which relationships between members of a group are broken or dissolved.</p>
<p>
   Social disorganization occurs when there is a change in the equilibrium
of forces, a breakdown of the social structure so that the former patterns no</p>











<pagenum page="normal" id="page00026">26</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:26</h1>
<p>
longer apply, and the accepted forms of social control no longer function
effectively. This disruptive condition of society, which is evidenced by
normlessness, role conflict, social conflicts, and demoralization, increases
social problems. For example, increasing industrialization, spread of
education, and women taking up paid work have affected the relations
between husband and wife, and between parents and children. Many of the
old norms which governed the intra-family and inter-family relations seem to
have broken down. Many people feel frustrated and unhappy. This is the
condition of social disorganization, in which changes in the basic conditions
of life, causing breakdown of traditional norms, have resulted in widespread
discontentment and disillusionment. In other words, change has disrupted the
organization of the formal system of behaviour. Talking of social disorgani-
zation in slum life, Whyte (1955: 268) has referred to deviant or non-approved
group organization in slums.</p>
<p>
    However, according to one school of thought, the state of social disorga-
nization does not always create social problems. For example, during Hitler’s
regime, Germany was not a disorganized society nor during Stalin’s regime
was the Soviet Union in a state of disorganization; yet many conditions in
these countries were shocking “deviations from the social ideal, demanding
social action”, that is, there were social problems. Reacting to this view, some
scholars say that even if the social disorganization theory may not explain all
social problems, it does explain some of the social problems, for example,
mental illness may not be a symptom of a disorganized society but corruption
in the society does lead to the malfunctioning of institutions, lack of perfect
consensus and the evasion of social control by some citizens.</p>
<p>
    In employing the social disorganization approach to social problems
(Horton and Leslie, 1970: 33), one looks to factors like: What were the tradi-
tional norms and practices? What were the major changes that made them
ineffective? What are the old rules which have broken down partially or
completely? What is the nature and direction of social change? Who are the
disgruntled groups and what solutions do they propose? How do various
proposed solutions fit in with the trend of social change? What may become
the accepted rules in the future?</p>

<h1> Cultural Lag Approach</h1>
<p>
Culture lag is a situation in which some parts of a culture change at a faster rate
than other related parts resulting in the disruption of integration and equilibrium
of the culture; for example, the material culture changes more rapidly than the
non-material culture in industrial societies through rapid advances in science and
technology (Ogburn, 1966). The theory of culture lag, in particular, holds that in
modern societies there has been a tendency for change in the political,</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00027">27</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:27</h1>
<p>
educational, family and religious institutions to fall behind technological changes.
It is thus easy to see how culture lag can create social problems. Even after rapid
industrialization in the last quarter of the 19th century and in the first quarter of
the 20th century, some people were so influenced by the rigid restrictions of the
caste system that they refused to work with members of other castes in the indus-
tries and preferred to remain unemployed and poor. The first quarter of the 20th
century, thus, remained a period of culture lag. It took more than a generation to
adapt ourselves to technological development in agriculture and industry. Our
social institutions, thus, retained the traditional flavour whereas technology
advanced in the world.</p>
<p>
    Though the culture lag theory explains some of the social problems (like
AIDS, population explosion, etc.), it does not explain all social problems. It,
therefore, cannot be accepted as a universal explanation of all social problems.
</p>
<h1>Value Conflict Approach</h1>
<p>
A value is a generalized principle of behaviour to which the members of a
group feel a strong, emotionally-toned positive commitment and which
provides a standard for judging specific acts and goals. Each member of the
group is expected to remain committed to the values accepted by the group.
Values, thus, provide the generalized standards of behaviour. Examples of
values are equality, justice, communal harmony, patriotism, mobility, collec-
tivism, compromise, sacrifice, adjustment and so forth. Because of the strong
emotional feeling attached to values and because they serve as standards for
judging concrete goals or actions, they are often regarded as absolute
(Theodorson, 1969: 456).</p>
<p>
     Different groups have different systems of values. Incompatibility
between the values of two or more groups to the extent that the role perfor-
mance of individuals is interfered with is called ‘value conflict’. This state of
conflict may last only a short while or it may be a persistent problem. For
example, conflict in values of workers and employers leads to industrial
unrest, strikes and lockouts; or conflict in values between land owners and
landless labourers leads to agrarian unrest or  agricultural labourers’
movements; or the liberal businessmen may believe in encouraging hard
work, thrift, honesty and ambition and may reward these virtues financially,
but on the other hand, the conservatives may differ profoundly with this view
and may believe in the profit motive and individual initiative. Liberals and
conservatives thus differ not only on matters of policies but more profoundly
on those of values.</p>
<p>
The value conflict theorists like Waller, Fuller, Cuber and Harper hold
that clashes in value system are of basic importance in the origin and</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00028">28</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:28</h1>
<p>
development of social problems. Waller (1936: 924) has referred to the conflict
between ‘organizational’ and ‘humanitarian’ values. The former favour
private property and individualism, while the latter are votaries of remedying
the misfortunes of others. </p>
<p>
   But this theoretical approach is too vague. The propounders have not
explained their views in concrete details. It is true that our current values
overemphasize money and material possessions and this attitude encourages
corruption, smuggling, drug trafficking, black marketing and taking of bribes
but problems like white-collar crime cannot be reduced to a conflict of values.
The problem of divorce may be the result of value conflict but all family
problems cannot be explained merely in terms of disagreements between
husband and wife or parents and children. Agreement on common values
helps in maintaining harmonious interpersonal relations in family or
outside it but it is not the only thing needed for family stability or group
success. Thus, the value conflict theory may be useful in some areas like
economics, and in the analysis of social problems, but it certainly cannot be
accepted as a universal explanation. </p>
<p>
   On applying the value conflict approach, questions which are generally
asked (Horton and Leslie, 1970: 40) are: What are the values that are in
conflict? How deep is the value conflict? What groups in the society hold to
each of the competing values? How powerful are they? Which values are more
consistent with other larger values such as democracy and freedom? What
value sacrifices would each solution require? Are some problems insoluble at
present because of certain irreconcilable value conflicts? </p>

<h1> Personal Deviation Approach</h1>
<p>
Deviation is non-conformity to social norms. It is different from abnormal
behaviour because the latter connotes psychological illness rather than social
maladjustment or conflict. Thus, people who deviate from social norms are
not necessarily mentally ill. </p>
<p>
    In the social disorganization approach to social problems, one looks to
the rules that have broken down and the changes that have taken place
because of the breaking of the rules. In personal deviation approach, one looks
to the motivation and behaviour of the deviants who are instrumental in
causing the problems. Two factors that need explanation in the personal
deviation approach are: (i) How does personal deviancy develop? (ii) What
types of personal deviation are frequently involved in social problems?
Personal deviancy develops because of either (a) an individual’s inability to
follow generally accepted norms, or (b) an individual’s failure to accept
generally accepted norms. The first is caused because of a person’s emotional, </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00029">29</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:29</h1>
<p>
social or biological deficiency, that is, some persons are so constituted biologi-
cally, emotionally, or socially that they are incapable of adhering consistently
to generally accepted standards. The socially deficient do not truly violate
norms; rather they manifest an inability to learn and follow the norms. The
cause of emotional deficiency is bio-psychological. These deviants that
constitute social problems and also contribute to problems often require
medical, psychiatric and environmental or social therapies. On the other
hand, an individual’s failure to accept social norms has something to do with
deficiency in socialization. These individuals, though have learnt the norms
and values like honesty, truthfulness, integrity, justice and cooperation, they
cannot put them into practice. They remain disposed to telling lies, cheating,
exploiting, defaming others when it suits their purposes. Their deviance does
not produce any guilt feeling or shame in them. They may change sides
abruptly and completely on a social issue if it serves their purpose. They care
little whether social problems exist and whether they are solved or not so long
the situation can be used for their vested interest.</p>
<p>
    Horton and Leslie (1970: 35-36) have referred to three types of personal
deviations: (i) Deviation that results from conformity to norms of diverse
reference groups. Because of cultural variability, most people are exposed to
different sets of norms that may be in conflict with one another. For example, a
person may belong to one religion or caste but his professional role may
literally force him to deviate from the norms of his religion/ caste. Similarly, a
clerk as well as an officer may accept bribe because it serves economic interests.
(ii) Deviation that results from the existence of deviant sub-cultures, for
example, the criminal norms in slum areas of large cities. (iii) Outright deviation
from generally accepted norms. Deliberately hiding one’s income while filling
income tax returns provides a good example of this type of deviation.</p>
<p>
    In applying the personal deviation approach to social problems, the
questions asked (Horton and Leslie, 1970: 37) are: What deviant
persons/ groups are involved? Are deviants themselves the problem or they
help create the problem? What deviant sub-cultures are involved? What alter-
natives are there for dealing with the deviants?</p>

<h1> Anomie Approach</h1>
<p>
This approach was propounded by Merton. Anomie is a condition charac-
terized by the relative absence or weakening or confusion of norms and values
in a society or a group. The concept of anomie was originally developed by
Durkheim to explain division of labour and suicide but it was Merton who
used this concept 41 years after the publication of Durkheim’s book Suicide to
explain deviant behaviour in terms of functioning of social and cultural struc-
tures in the society (Merton, 1938: 672—73). Anomie involves a breakdown in</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00030">30</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:30</h1>
<p>
the cultural structure, occurring particularly when there is disjunction
between cultural norms and goals and the socially structured capacities of
members of the group to act in accordance with them.</p>
<p>
     Anomie is the counterpart of the idea of social solidarity. Just as social
solidarity is a state of collective ideological integration, anomie is a state of
confusion, insecurity and normlessness. According to Merton, the disjunction
between goals and means and the consequent strain leads to the weakening of
men’s commitment to the culturally prescribed goals or institutionalized
means, that is, to a state of anomie. Merton maintains that people adapt
themselves to this disjunction either by rejecting the cultural goals or the insti-
tutionalized means or both. He gives four varieties of deviant behaviour.
Merton, thus, locates the sources of strain not in the characteristics of
individuals but in the culture and/ or social structure. He says, “the social
problem arises not from people failing to live upto the requirements of their
social statuses but from the faulty organization of these statuses into a
reasonably coherent social system” (Merton and Nisbet, 1971: 823).</p>
<p>
     However, Merton’s theory is incomplete and inadequate. All social
problems cannot be perceived as the result of the responses to strains or mode
of adaptation and adjustment.</p>

<h1> Types of Social Problems</h1>
<p>
Social problems encountered in a society are usually diverse in nature. The
factors responsible can be categorized as follows: (i) economic, usually in the
form of poverty, unemployment, etc., (ii) cultural, usually in the form of
divorce, juvenile delinquency, etc., (iii) biological, usually in the form of infec-
tious diseases, food poisoning, etc., and (iv) psychological, usually in the form
of neurological disease, a cult, etc.</p>
<p>
    Case (1964: 34) has described four types of social problems on the basis
of their origin: (i) which are rooted in some aspect of the physical
environment; (ii) which are inherent in the nature or distribution of the
population involved; (iii) which result from poor social organization; and (iv)
which evolve from a conflict of cultural values within the society.</p>
<p>
According to Fuller and Myers (1941: 367), there are three types of
problems: (i) physical problems: though these are problems for the society but
their causes are not based on value conflicts, for example, floods and famines;
(ii) ameliorative problems: there is consensus about the effects of these
problems but there are differences pertaining to their solutions, for example,
crime, poverty, and AIDS; and (iii) moral problems: there is no consensus
pertaining to the nature or causes of these problems, for example, gambling,
alcoholism, drug abuse and divorce.</p>

<h1>Methods of Studying Social Problems,Page no:31</h1>
<p>
While scientific methods are basically similar for all sciences, scientific
techniques differ, for techniques are the particular ways in which scientific
methods are applied to a particular problem. Each science, therefore, develops
a series of techniques which fit the body of material it studies. What are the
techniques of sociological research in studying social problems? Three
methods have mainly been used in studying social problems, namely, (i) case
study method, (ii) social survey method, and (iii) multiple factor method.
Each method has certain advantages as well as limitations.</p>

<h1> Case Study Method</h1>
<p>
The case study is a complete, detailed account of an event, situation, or devel-
opment. This method is qualitative instead of quantitative. It analyses the
social process involved in the development of a social problem as well as in the
causal analysis. It focuses on the sequence of events, motivations of persons,
social influences affecting persons and events, social relations, sub-cultures and
so forth (Bettelheim, 1955: 318). For collecting information, it depends on
both primary and secondary sources like documents, letters and newspapers
(Gordon, 1942). Depending on the nature of the social problem, the case
study can be used to study a sub-culture of deviants such as that of organized
criminals, black marketeers, smugglers, drug addicts, etc.</p>
<p>
     Perhaps, the greatest value of the case study is in the suggestion of
hypotheses, which can then be tested by other methods. For instance, much of
our reliable knowledge about adult crime, female crime, juvenile delinquency
and crime against women has developed through the testing of hypotheses
which were suggested by early case studies of criminals, delinquents, victims of
violence, etc. These hypotheses are not often tested by the case study method
but by other methods. A generalization cannot be based on a single case, for a
case can be found to ‘prove’ almost anything (Horton, 1984: 34). Generaliza—
tions are based on a large mass of carefully processed data and the collection of a
great many case studies is expensive. Also, it is difficult to ‘add up’ a number of
case studies or compute averages or other statistical computations. Therefore,
case studies are seldom used when seeking to test a hypothesis.</p>
<p>
     In analysing the causes of a social problem, the case study method is a
qualitative procedure which seeks to formulate generalizations about the
development of subject’s behaviour. One example of this is the analysis of
causes of drug addiction. By exhaustive probing of case after case and the
comparing of crucial cases, Lindesmith (1948: 13—15) compared addicts with
non-addicts who received drugs for a long time without becoming addicted.
This enabled him to isolate the causal processes of addiction that were absent
in cases of non-addiction.</p>











<pagenum page="normal" id="page00032">32</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:32</h1>
<p>
This method requires a capacity for cultivating the cooperation and
trust of subjects as well as a skill for intensive guided interviewing
(Weinberg, 1960: 69). </p>

<h1> Social Survey Method</h1>
<p>
Sometimes the facts we need are not recorded anywhere and we collect them by
interviewing people. Interview and questionnaire studies, or the social survey
method, thus, is a valuable technique for studying social problems in contem-
porary society. It collects data from samples of respondents representing a
cross-section of a given population through a schedule or a questionnaire. This
instrument is frequently used in the field of sociology to answer concrete as well
as abstract questions. Studies on begging, drug abuse, AIDS, alcoholism, youth
crime and dowry in India, or Kinsey’s (1948) study of sex behaviour in the USA
are the best examples of studying social problems through the social survey
method. All these studies have pointed out the empirical relationship between
two or more variables in creating a social problem. </p>
<p>
     The survey method does not necessarily start with a hypothesis. It can
end in developing a hypothesis or it may not at all be concerned with a
hypothesis. When it seeks answers to questions, it does not test a hypothesis.
For example, what is the magnitude of abuse of  girl children in a particular
type of industry is a practical question which the information gathered in the
survey will answer. But, the survey can test the hypothesis too. For example,
this author tested the hypothesis that “familial maladjustment is the most
important cause of criminality among females” (Ahuja, 1966); and also the
hypothesis that crime/ violence against women is caused by “social structural
conditions that create anxieties and stresses which affect the adjustment,
attachment and commitment of man”. “Maladjustment, unattachment and
non-commitment lead to frustrations and relative deprivations which is turn
determine man’s attitude toward women. Depending on his personality traits
and the resistance potential of the victim, the man uses violence against
women” (Ahuja, 1987). </p>
<p>
    Questionnaires, schedules and interviews are the systematic ways of
collecting data under scientific controls. But these methods have their pitfalls
too which are avoided by sociologists in all possible ways. Assuming that
these techniques have a margin of error, they are still very useful, for they are
more reliable than guesswork. </p>

<h1> Multiple Factor Method</h1>
<p>
This method determines the relationship between several factors and a social
problem. Factors such as the nature of associations, socio-economic status, </p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00033">33</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:33 </h1>
<p>
sub-culture, marital status, residential background, intra—family relations,
frustrations and inherited traits can be correlated positively or negatively with
the social problem under investigation; for example, the relation between
crime and poverty or between drug addiction and peer group associations and
high economic status or between wife battering and inferiority complex and
alcoholism or between suicide and feeling of social isolation, marital status,
and religion. </p>
<p>
     The multi-factor approach is used both in single disciplinary studies as
well as in interdisciplinary studies of social problems, for instance, collabo-
rative studies on drug addiction by medical scientists, psychologists,
sociologists and criminologists in India (Mohan, 1980). </p>

<h1>Evaluation Research</h1>
<p>
The scientific research to analyse the effectiveness of the measures taken to
contain a social problem, or to reduce the problems of the sufferers, or to
assess the social action programmes such as rehabilitation of drug addicts, job
training of the handicapped, and the like, is called ‘evaluation research’. Evalu-
ation research uses different techniques of data collection with the object of
gathering knowledge in deciding what programmes should continue and how
to improve them. In theory, though the purpose of evaluation research is to
assess the ‘success’ of the programme started for the people but in practice, the
purpose is to find out whether the funding of the programme should be
continued or not. </p>
<p>
     In evaluation research, many variables are controlled. Often, the
findings of various evaluation studies are so conflicting that no firm conclu-
sions can be drawn. For example, a number of studies have been conducted in
India on students’ agitations in educational institutions, atrocities against the
weaker sections of society, strikes in industries, bonded labourers, etc., and it
has been found that the reported results vary so widely that no clear decision
is possible. Even when numerous studies do agree, they are disbelieved and
ignored. Studies critical of the functioning agency are quietly buried and those
whose conclusions conflict with the popular beliefs are disregarded. Despite
these difficulties and pitfalls, evaluation research on social problems is the
most rapidly growing area of sociological research. </p>
<p>
Stages in the Development of a Social Problem
Fuller and Myres (1941: 320—28) have referred to three stages through which a
problem passes in the process of being defined and solved:
(1) Awareness: In this first stage, people become convinced that the problem
exists, the condition is undesirable, and that something can be done </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00034">34</pagenum>
<h1>Page no</h1>
<p>
about it. In the beginning, only a few people raise questions but
gradually more people become aware of the existence of the problem. </p>
<p>
(2)Policy determination: As awareness spreads to larger segments of the
society, possible solutions come to be discussed, for example, discussion
of population explosion in India and various means of family planning
in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Thus, the emphasis in the
second stage shifts from what should be done to how should be done.
(3)Reform: As basic solutions and policies are decided upon, the stage of
action is reached, for example, not only a plan for clearing the slums is
put into practice but people living there are also accommodated
elsewhere. No wonder, this stage is called the stage of implementation
rather than the stage of decision. </p>
<p>Blumer (1971: 290-309) has referred to five stages in the course of a social
problem: (i) emergence of a problem, (ii) legitimation of a problem, (iii)
mobilization of action, (iv) formulation of an official plan, and (v) implemen-
tation of the official plan. He says that movement from one stage to another is
not automatic but it depends on many contingencies. </p>
<p>
Spector and Kitsuse (1977: 141-50) have talked of four stages in the
development of a social problem. These are: </p>
<p>
(1)Agitation: The people feel aggrieved about the existing situation in the
society. They agitate against this grievance (i) to convince others that the
problem exists, and (ii) to initiate action to improve conditions and to
attack the alleged cause of the grievance. The agitation is started not
necessarily by the victims but even by moral crusaders on behalf of the
victims, for example, the prohibition movement is started not by
alcoholics but by social workers and social reformers. Thus, the
agitation is to convert private troubles into public issues by declaring
them to be harmful, offensive and undesirable. However, it is not
necessary that their efforts should succeed. The efforts fail either because
the claims made are too vague, or because the group that makes these
efforts is insignificant or powerless, or because the group creates
conflicting interests. </p>
<p>
Legitimatation and capitation: When the group in power or the power
holders acknowledge the existence of the problem, the problem acquires
legitimacy. Whereas in the first stage, the claimants of the problems are
viewed as peculiar individuals, in this stage they are viewed as legitimate
Spokesmen of the aggrieved people. They are, therefore, co—opted for
discussing alternative solutions, for example, giving representation to
workers in factories, in management bodies or to students in the
academic councils. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00035">35</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:35</h1>
<p>
(3) Bureaucratization and reaction: When the focus in the first stage is on the
complaint group, in the second stage it is on the decision-makers, and in
the third stage, it is the bureaucrats and their efficiency which attracts
attention. The extent to which the bureaucrats look for solutions of the
problem and the extent to which they are able to fob off vested interests
will determine whether the agitation will take the form of a movement
or not. </p>
<p>
(4) Re—emergence of the movement: The defective policies of the
decision-makers and the bureaucrats and their disinterestedness vis-a-vis
the problem rekindle the feelings of the aggrieved people and their
crusaders who start a movement to force the power holders to adopt
ameliorative measures for solving the problem.</p>
<p>
   Thus, according to Spector and Kitsuse (1977: 20), “social problems are
pre—eminently a political process through which the problem comes to be
publicly accepted as such and through which particular institutional responses
to the problem are shaped and then reshaped”.</p>

<h1>Solving Social Problems</h1>
<p>
A perusal of social problems that affect mankind today indicates that it is not
the nature of these problems, but the level of their operation that causes them.</p>
<p>
   The solving of a social problem depends upon finding out the causes of
troublesome social conditions which create the problem. As already stated,
though every social problem is caused by multiple factors, but it is always
possible to find out the chief factor, the cooperative factors and the minor
aggravants in the origin and development of the problem. Every problem is
likely to be unique and is likely to have individualistic traits which may differ-
entiate it from other problems. Many a time, the nature of the social problem
is such that the control becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible. This
happens when a social problem is occasioned by natural factors like droughts
or floods or when the conflict of social interests blocks the application of
curative programmes, or a revolution is needed to change the existing political
or economic systems. But after understanding and judging social problems,
the society has to be effective and has to take some action whether it is by
attempting to alter the established social institutions or by trying to alleviate
them by adopting measures without trying to change the existing institutions.
Further, action can be organized or personalized. The former is action
through group effort like giving a share to industrial workers in the
management of the industry, whereas the latter is action through individual
life and influencing others by living a life in accordance with good principles.
Gandhiji used the second method for solving the problem of</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00036">36</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:36</h1>
<p>
untouchability—by living with untouchables and treating them with
sympathy and kindness. When others imitated his example and followed him,
the effect became greater and greater, and the government was ultimately
forced to enact a law in 1955 prohibiting the practice of untouchability.</p>
<p>
    Organized action, thus can be taken by the state or a political party or
by the panchayat or an official group. An important point in organized action
is the distribution of functions between state agencies and those not connected
with the state. Sometimes the problem is solved by the combination of
organized and personalized actions.</p>
<p>
Social problems can be solved only when individuals in a society possess
the following four feelings: (1) feeling that a situation can be corrected, (2)
determination to correct the situation, (3) confidence in the people and a belief
that there is no limit to progress because of their intelligence and efforts, and
(4) the use of technological and rational knowledge and skill for correcting the
situation.</p>
<p>
The following three points have to be remembered while trying to reach
an effective solution to a social problem:</p>
<p>
(1) Multiple-factor approach: Each social problem is caused by a number of
factors, for example, the problem of crime cannot be contained unless it
is collectively perceived in terms of poverty, unemployment, social
associations, functioning of social structures, strains and frustrations, and
so on.

(2) Interrelatedness: No social problem can be perceived atomistically. Each
problem has some relation to the other problems.

(3) Relativity: Each social problem is related to time and space. What is
considered a problem in one society may not be considered so in the
other.</p>

<h1>Social Problems and Social Change in India</h1>
<p>
Societies often face problems because of social and cultural changes. Social
change is change in the patterned roles, or a change in the network of social
relations, or a change in the structures and organization of a society. Social
change is never complete or total; it is always partial. It can be minor or funda-
mental. Further, the change can be spontaneous or planned. Planned change is
to achieve some set collective ideals. After independence, India also had set
some collective goals to achieve.</p>
<p>
    Some of the important changes that we find in our society in the last six
decades are: change from tradition to modernity in certain values and institu-
tions, from ascribed status to achieved status, from predominance of primary
groups to predominance of secondary groups, from informal means of</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00037">37</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:37</h1>
<p>
control to formal means of control, from collectivity to individualism, from
sacred values to secular values, from folklore to science and rationalism, from
homogeneity to heterogeneity, and increasing processes of industrialization
and urbanization, increasing awareness of rights among various sections of
society due to the spread of education, weakening of the caste system,
weakening of traditional sources of security, an increase in the aspirations of
minority groups, occupational mobility, enactment of several social laws, and
de—linking religion from politics. </p>
<p>
   Thus, though we have achieved many of the set collective goals, many
contradictions have also set into our system. For example, aspirations of the
people have become high but the legitimate means for achieving these aspira-
tions are neither available nor accessible. We preach nationalism but practise
casteism, linguism and parochialism. Many laws have been enacted but either
these laws are full of loopholes or they are not properly implemented. We talk
of egalitarianism but we enforce discrimination. We aspire for an ideational
culture but what is emerging is the sensate culture. All these contradictions
have increased discontentment and frustrations among people which in turn
have resulted in many social problems. Youth unrest, tribal unrest, peasant
unrest, labour unrest, student unrest, minority unrest, violence against
women, and so forth, have all led to agitations, riots, insurgency and terrorism
in the country. </p>

<h1>Sociology, Sociologists and Social Problems</h1>
<p>
Before we analyse the relationship between sociology and social problems, we
need to answer a question: Why we study social problems in sociology? It is
not because most people consider them ‘bad’ and these need to be eliminated.
In fact, sociology as a social science, like natural sciences, attempts to approach
its subject matter objectively. If we approach the study of social problems
assuming that they are bad, we are not being objective and will not achieve a
sociological understanding. </p>
<p>
The three issues which need analysis with regard to the relationship
between sociology and social problems are: (1) how does sociology perceive
social problems; (2) what sociological principles does sociology offer about the
social problems; and (3) to what extent is the knowledge of the sociologists
about social problems impartial, confirmed and concrete? </p>
<p>
    As far as the sociologists’ perspective is concerned, they view social
problems as problems which arise out of the functioning of systems and struc-
tures in a society, or which are the result of group influences. They are also

concerned with its effects on the body, a psychiatrist will be concerned with
its effects on attitudes and behaviour, and a sociologist will be concerned with
its effects on social relations and roles, that is, the relations with family
members, with colleagues in the office, and with neighbours and friends as
well as its effect on work efficiency, status, and so on.</p>
<p>
   The study of social problems in sociology aspires towards a body of
valid and logically related principles, and in some cases towards a systematic
theory too (Rose, 1957: 189—99). Sociological knowledge of social problems is
not complete. We have considerable knowledge about some social problems
like crime and drug abuse, but inadequate knowledge about others like
suicide, bonded labour, black marketing, mental illness, etc. According to
Weinberg (1960: 64), this unevenness in knowledge about social problems is
because our approach to social problems is generally ‘problem—centred’ rather
than ‘theory-centred’. Most sociologists study social problems because of the
practical interest of the community rather than for building a theory, or
filling up the theoretical gaps. As regards bias in the sociologists’ knowledge,
though it is true that their orientation and their values can influence their
study of social problems, yet they try to interpret facts without any distortion
(Kolb, 1954: 66-67). For example, a sociologist from a lower or a middle class
is likely to have a bias towards his/ her own class, yet he/ she does not analyse
corruption in upper class on the basis of his/ her personal predilections.
He/ she remains impartial without being affected by any pressures. However,
one possibility that exists is that persons involved in many social problems
(that is, subjects) can and do directly influence the knowledge which
emerges. For example, a sociological study of wife battering is possible in a
society like India on a ‘snowball’ method because the complaints of assault
are never lodged with the police. The study generally points out the
involvement of women from lower income groups. Hence, we do not have
much knowledge about battered women in upper-middle or upper income
groups. The fact that data on all types of battered women is not available is
bound to affect the sociological conclusions or hypotheses. Similarly, the
study of role adjustment of working women restricted to the lower class
rarely points to separation, desertion or divorce between husband and wife
but the study of working women in middle and upper classes would
probably show a higher likelihood of these steps.</p>
<p>
One more fact in the study of social problems by the sociologists is that
some sociologists think that the only role of a sociologist is that of an analyst,
that is, he/ she is to understand social problems but not take interest in their
solution. Others think that a sociologist has not only to study social problems
but has to devise ways and means to correct them. Knowledge cannot be</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00039">39</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:39</h1>
<p>
detached completely from concerted corrective action. It has to be used in
alleviating social problems. But, the fact to be remembered is that a sociologist
by himself/ herself cannot solve a social problem. Much depends on the
officials, politicians, agencies and general public.</p>
<p>
    What is the task of a sociologist? The time has come when sociologists
decide to undertake ‘management of change in society’ like management of
business or management of administration. The central concerns of sociology
are order and change. The concern for change includes the directionality of
change, and sociologists have to move from delving deep into the hoary past
through Indology and ancient history and from postulating concepts and
theories suitable to study Indian social reality to futuristic plans and to identi-
fying and dealing with crises in the society.</p>
<p>
     Here, a question may be raised: should sociologists be concerned with
applied programmes directed at finding solutions to our social problems and
in the basic research activities designed to support them? Our answer would
be in the affirmative. The depth of a society’s problems may require deeper
structural and cultural changes. While sociologists have always been involved
in analysing and understanding established practices, now they have to be
called upon to suggest new structures and new practices. In so doing, the
question arises as to what are the appropriate ways for the sociologists to
suggest changes? The first question is, how directly should the sociologists
involve themselves in effecting a change in public policy? Should sociologists
remain dispassionate scientists, only providing data for others to use, or
should they become actively involved as impassioned advocates of change?
There is a school which stresses direct action in public policies on the part of
the sociologists. We have to support this school. Sociology is a science which
has to be pursued for its fruits, for the sake of what it can do. In its initial
stages, the gifts of sociology may not have been great but after the labour that
has been put in developing this science during the last five to six decades, the
fruits may be plucked not for their beauty but for their utility. Earlier, we
might have been bogged down in explaining various concepts or in histori-
cally tracing the growth and functioning of various social institutions and
communities but today our discipline has to take up the questions of the
present and the future imbalances seriously. In this, questions of relevance and
priorities in researches are significant. Why have top Indian sociologists
remained indifferent to studying problems and critical issues like insurgency
in North-East India, terrorism in Punjab, linguistic mobilization in Assam,
cultural polarization in Mizoram, anti-reservation agitations in Gujarat,
Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,
communal riots in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, and police</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00040">40</pagenum>

<p>
torture and criminalization of politics in Bihar? Is it because they are afraid of
displeasing the establishment by their unbiased and critical evaluations and
losing their positions in councils and committees and commissions, or is it
because they think that these issues do not fall within the scope of their pure
science? We are not trying to be critical but only pointing to the need for
sociologists to take interest in the management of change in society. If
sociology and sociologists alienate themselves from the immediate issues and
problems of our society, both our discipline and our scholars will render
themselves irrelevant to the nation as well as to humanism. It is time that the
sociologists develop better predictive capabilities and present the options to
the public in a comprehensible manner. This alone will help the society in
tackling social problems effectively.</p>
<p>
To conclude, it may be said that the sociologists’ role in studying social
problems is to create an awareness about these problems, analyse the causes of
problems, develop theories about the problems, discuss effects of social
problems on individuals, groups and society, and examine the consequences of
alternate plans suggested for solving problems.</p>

     2 Poverty,Page no:42
</h1>
<p>
  It is only in the second half of the 20th century that poverty and the poor have
come to be matters of our concern and obligation. After a long neglect of the
poor during the British rule, the measures adopted after independence signify
the recognition of poverty and the social responsibility for alleviating it. How
did this happen? What have we done? How far have we succeeded? Before
attempting to answer these questions, let us first discuss the concept of poverty.
</p>
<h1>The Concept</h1>
<p>
The definition of poverty matters because how it is defined determines how
much poverty there is believed to be. The definition can also influence the
explanations of poverty and the possible solutions that are put forward. As
Ruth Lister puts it, “How we define poverty is critical to political, policy and
academic debates about the concept. It is bound up with explanations and has
implications of solutions” (cited in Holborn and Haralambos, 2008: 214).</p>
<p>
    Poverty is a situation that gives rise to a feeling of a discrepancy between
what one has and what one should have. What one should have is an internal
construct; hence, each person’s feeling and experience of poverty is individual
and unique. But, the feeling of ‘powerlessness’ and ‘resourcelessness’ is
possessed by all poor people. Henry Bernstein (1992) has identified the
following dimensions of poverty:</p>
<p>
     . Lack of livelihood strategies

     . Inaccessibility to resources (money, land, credit)

     . Feeling of insecurity and frustrations

    .  Inability to maintain and develop social relations with others as a
       consequence of lack of resources
 </p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00043">43</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:43</h1>
<p>
Three precepts are often used to define poverty: (i) the amount of money
required by a person to subsist, (ii) the life below a ‘minimum subsistence
level’ and ‘living standard’ prevalent at a given time in a given place, and (iii)
the comparative state of well-being of a few and the deprivation and desti-
tution of the majority in society.The last approach explains poverty in terms
of relativity and inequality. Whereas the first two precepts refer to the
economic concept of absolute poverty, the third one views it as a social
concept, that is, in terms of the share of the total national income received by
those at the bottom. We will explain each of the three views separately. </p>

<h1> The First View</h1>
<p>
In terms of a minimum income required for subsistence, poverty has been
defined as an inability to gratify the physiological needs, that is, need for
survival, safety and security. These physiological needs are different from the
social needs (ego satisfaction and self-esteem), the need for autonomy, the need
for independence and the need for self-actualization. The minimum require-
ments for fulfilling the physiological needs are food and nutrition, shelter, and
preventive and protective health care. This requires ‘minimum’ income
(varying from society to society) to buy necessities and availing of facilities.</p>
<p>
   Here ‘poverty’ is perceived in terms of ‘poverty line’ which is determined
by the prevailing standards of what is needed for health, efficiency, nurturing of
children, social participation, and the maintenance of self-respect (Becker, 1966:
436). In practice, however, the poverty line is drawn on the basis of a barest
minimum desirable nutritional standard of calorie intake. In India, the poverty
line was drawn in 1978 on the basis of a per capita (adult) daily intake of 2,400
calories for the rural and 2,100 calories for the urban areas. Then, the cost of
foodgrains that fulfils this normative standard was calculated. Accordingly, at
present, the poverty line stands at Rs 368 and Rs 559 per person per month for
rural and urban areas, respectively, which is just enough to buy 650 grams of
foodgrain every day.</p>

<h1> The Second View</h1>
<p>
This View maintains that poverty has three main aspects of want of material
goods or materialistic possessions: (i) those necessary to avoid physical
suffering and needed to fulfil the requirements of hunger and shelter, that is,
those needed to survive; (ii) those essential to meet human needs of health,
that is, to get nutrition and to avoid disease; and (iii) those needed to maintain
a minimum subsistence level. In simple terms, this refers to a minimum
amount of food intake, adequate housing, clothing, education and health care.
In India, according to the Planning Commission, at current prices, anyone</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00044">44</pagenum>

<p>
spending Rs 965 per month in urban areas and Rs 781 in rural areas will be
deemed to be poor. </p>
<p>
Gross and Miller (1946: 83) attempted to explain poverty in terms of
three factors: income (covert and manifest), assets, and availability of services
(educational, medical, recreational.) But others have considered the concept of
poverty with this perspective elusive. For example, in the United States, out
of those families living ‘below the poverty level’ in 1960, 57.6 per cent had a
telephone, 79.2 per cent owned a TV set and 72.6 per cent possessed a washing
machine (Becker, 1966: 435). The assets or the materialistic possessions,
therefore, cannot be the basis of specifying poverty. Likewise, poverty cannot
be related to the ‘income’ factor. If there is an increase in the ‘price level’,
people may not be able to provide the necessities of life for their family
members. Obviously then, poverty has to be related to time and place. </p>

<h1>The Third View</h1>
<p>
This view defines poverty as a condition of falling below the minimum
standards of subsistence appropriate to each society, or “the absence of enough
money to secure life’s necessities”, or “a condition of acute physical
want—starvation, malnutrition, disease, and want of clothing, shelter and
medical care”. The latter is measured by comparing the condition of those at
the bottom of the society with the other segments of the population. It is,
thus, a matter of subjective definition rather than of objective conditions.
Poverty is determined by the standards that exist within a society. Miller and
Roby (1970: 34—37) have said that in this approach, poverty is sharply
regarded as ‘inequality’. From a sociological point of view, this definition is
more important in terms of the impact which inequality of income has on the
life situation and life chances of the poor. Absolute poverty can be
reduced/ eliminated by putting money into the hands of the poor but
‘inequality’ cannot be solved by moving people above a certain relative line.
As long as there are people at the bottom of the income scale, they are in some
way poor. Such a condition will continue to exist as long as we have social
stratification.</p>
<p>
   Harrington (1958: 83) defined poverty with reference to ‘deprivation’.
According to him, poverty is the deprivation of those minimal levels of food,
health, housing, education, and recreation which are compatible with the
contemporary technology, beliefs and values of a particular society. Rein
(1968: 116) identifies three elements in poverty: subsistence, inequality and
externality. Subsistence emphasizes the provisions of sufficient resources to
maintain health and working capacity in the sense of survival, and capacity to
maintain physical efficiency. Inequality compares the lot of individuals at the
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00045">45</pagenum>
<h1>Page no:45</h1>
<p>
bottom layer of stratified income levels with that of the more privileged
people in the same society. Their deprivation is relative. Externality focuses
on the social consequences of poverty for the rest of society, apart from the
impact on the poor themselves. </p>
<p>
    Sociologically speaking, the poor are caught up in vicious circles. Being
poor means living in poor neighbourhood, which means being unable to send
children to schools, which means not only the poor themselves but their
children too will have low-paying jobs or no jobs at all, which means being
doomed to remain poor for ever. Also, being poor means eating poor food,
which means having poor health, which in turn means being handicapped or
too weak to handle the heavy manual work, which also means accepting low
paid work, which leads to remaining poor for ever. Thus, each circle begins and
ends with being poor. No wonder, sociologists like Thomas Gladwin (1967:
76—77) give more importance to ‘inequality’ or the social concept of poverty. </p>

<h1>Measurements of Poverty</h1>
<p>
First, researchers have disputed whether poverty should be measured in ‘abso—
lute’ or ‘relative’ terms. Sane writers have argued that there is a common
minimum standard that can be applied to all societies below which individuals
can be said to be in poverty. </p>
<p>
   Measures of absolute poverty are usually based upon the idea of
subsistance. In other words, people are in poverty if they do not have the
resources to maintain human life. </p>
<p>
Supporters of the concept of relative poverty, however, tend to dismiss
this view. They argue that a definition must relate to the standards of a
particular society at a particular time. According to this view, the point at
which the dividing line separates the poor from other members of society is
drawn, will vary according to how affluent that society is. </p>
<p>
  Now, the question arises: What are the measurements of poverty? The
important measurements are: malnutrition, low consumption expenditure,
low income, chronic illness or poor health, illiteracy, unemployment and/ or
underemployment, and unsanitary housing conditions. Broadly, the poverty
of a given society is expressed in terms of poor resources, low national
income, low per capita income, high disparity in income distribution, weak
defence, and the like. </p>
<p>
    Some scholars have referred to poverty-linked characteristics of house-
holds to point out that individuals from these households run a greater risk of
being poor. The chances increase as the households exhibit more of these
characteristics. The more important among these characteristics are: absence
of a full-time wage earner in the house, households where men are above 60 </p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00046">46</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:46 </h1>
<p>
years age, households headed by a female, households with more than six
children of less than 18 years of age, households whose heads are living on
daily wages, households whose members have less than the primary
education, households with members without work experience, and house-
holds having members only with part-time employment.</p>

<h1> Poverty in India </h1>
<p>
India represents a dichotomy in development. According to UNIDO’S
‘Yearbook of Statistics 2010’ India has emerged as one of the world’s top ten
countries in industrial production. It ranks ninth in world industrial
production and tenth in gross national production (GNP), yet it has a large
population that is extremely poor. The United Nations Human Development
Index (2013), based on three indicators—life expectancy, access to education
and income levels—ranks India 136th among 186 countries (The Times of
India, 15 March 2013). Although since independence, the country has regis-
tered a significant overall growth rate, and there has been a progressive
increase in the per capita income—from Rs 1,630 in 1980—81 to Rs 4,974 in
1990—91 to Rs 16,688 in 2000-01 to Rs 54,835 in 2010—11, yet there has been a
deterioration in the living standards of a large section of the population. </p>
<p>
According to Ansari and Akhtar (2012), at the beginning of the new
millennium, 260 million people in India did not have income to access a
consumption basket which defines the poverty line. Of these, 75 per cent
were in the rural areas. India is home to 22 per cent of the world’s poor. Such
a high incidence of poverty is a matter of concern in View of the fact that
poverty eradication has been one of the major objectives of the development
planning process. </p>
<p>
In India, the last decade of the 20th century has seen a visible shift in the
focus of development planning from the mere expansion of production of
goods and services, and the consequent growth of per capita income, to
planning for enhancement of human well-being. The notion of human
well-being itself is more broadly conceived to include not only consumption of
goods and services in general, but more specifically to ensure that the basic
material requirements of all sections of the population, especially those below
the poverty line, are met and that they have access to basic services such as
health and education. This approach has resulted in the reduction in poverty
along with overall improvement in the quality of life. Since India became part
of the global economy and underwent economic reform in 1991, its economy is
growing at a faster rate of nearly 10 per cent per annum. In the process, India
has become the fourth largest economy in the world. In the last two decades, a
significant proportion of the population across the country has reaped the </p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00047">47</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:47 </h1>
<p>
benefits of this economic growth. They have become the part of global
economy and market, and their lives have transformed into one of global
citizens with all the comforts and luxury in life. Apart from this burgeoning
middle class in the country, the economic growth seemed to have touched the
lives of the poor also. According to the National Sample Survey Organization
(NSSO) results, people living below poverty line (BPL) have dramatically come
down during the post-economic reform era: from 36 per cent in 1993-94 (50th
Round,NSSO) to 26 per cent in 1999—2000 (55th Round, NSSO). According to
the latest estimates of the Planning Commission, while the percentage of rural
BPL population has dropped to 27.09 from 37.27, in urban India, it fell to 23.62
per cent from 32.36 per cent during the five-year period. In absolute terms too,
the BPL population has dropped by over 19 per cent, to 26.3 crore in
1999-2000, from 32.04 crore in 1993—94. </p>
<p>
    The rural poor stands at 19.32 crore (as against 24.4 crore) while the
urban poor stands at 6.71 crore. At the state level, although the percentage of
BPL population in Orissa (now Odisha) has declined to 47.15 per cent from
48.56 per cent, it has overtaken Bihar to reach the top slot with the highest
incidence of poverty. The other big states with high incidence of poverty were
Madhya Pradesh at 37.43 per cent (as against 43.52%), Assam 40.86 per cent
(36.09%), Uttar Pradesh 31.15 per cent (40.85%) and West Bengal 27.02 per
cent (35.66%). </p>
<p>
    According to the latest data released by the Planning Commission,
though poverty has shown biggest drop, one in five Indians is still below
poverty line as the share of BPL population in the total population is 21.9 per
cent, or 270 million (the government has set the bar low, defining as BPL
anyone earning Rs 27.20 or less in rural areas and up to Rs 33.30 a day in
urban areas). </p>
<p>
     The other important trend that came from the latest poverty estimates is
the fact that rural India has seen faster improvement that urban India. The
decline in poverty is deeper in rural areas as BPL population came down to
25.8 per cent in 2011-- 1.2 from 42 per cent in 2004—05, around 17 percentage
points, as against 12 percentage points in urban areas. </p>
<p>
     On an all-India basis, there were 217 million poor in rural areas and 53
million in urban areas in 2011-12, as against 326 million and 81 million,
respectively, in rural and urban areas in 2004-05. </p>
<p>
    State-wise, Odisha and Bihar have recorded the sharpest decline in
poverty levels between 2004—05 and 2011—12, although the proportion of the
poor in these states remains well above the national average. While in Odisha
the proportion of poor in the total population came down from 57.2 per cent
to 32.6 per cent--- a decline of 24.6 percentage points, in Bihar the share of poor
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00048">48</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:48 </h1>
<p>
was estimated at 33.7 per cent, compared to 54.4 per cent —a reduction by 20.7
percentage points.</p>
<p>
    Among the so—called ‘Bimaru’ states, only Rajasthan has managed to do
better than the national average with the share of BPL in total population
estimated at 14.7 per cent in 2011—12, compared to 34.4 per cent in 2004-05
(Times of India, July 24, 2013).</p>
<p>
     These figures are based on the benchmark set by the Tendulkar
Committee. However, it is expected that the alternative Rangarajan Panel
figures will be available soon. </p>
<p>
    In spite of reduction in the number of poor across the country, income
disparity between rich and poor is growing rapidly. The new data released by
NSSO shows that spending and consumption by the richest 5 per cent
increased by over 60 per cent between 2000 and 2012 in rural areas while the
poorest 5 per cent saw an increase of just 30 per cent. In urban areas, the
richest segment’s spending increased by 63 per cent while the poorest saw an
increase of 33 per cent (Times of India, 28 July 2013).</p>

<h1> Causes of Poverty </h1>
<p>
There are two extreme perspectives on the basis of which we can analyse the
causes of poverty —the old and the modern. One view of poverty is that it is
providential and it is the result of an individual’s past karmas (deeds) or sins.
The other view ascribes poverty to be the result of a failure of an individual’s
working abilities or due to his/ her lack of motivation. Describing the richness
of a rich person in terms of his/ her destiny and the poverty of a poor person
in terms of his/ her lack of abilities serves the economic interest of the rich
people as they escape paying high taxes to be used for uplifting the poor. One
modern view links poverty with factors which are beyond an individual’s
control, the other describes the functioning of social systems in the society as
the cause of poverty. </p>
<p>
    David Elesh (1973: 359) has given three causes of poverty: individual,
culture or sub-culture of poverty, and social structure. </p>
<h1> Individual </h1>
<p>
The ideology of individualism which finds the cause of poverty within the
individual is that success and failure of an individual are his personal matters. If
one ends up in poverty, it is his own fault, because he is lazy, dull, inefficient or
lacks initiative. This ideology maintains that poverty is good for society because
the fittest will survive. Another aspect of this ideology is the Protestant Ethics
described by Max Weber which emphasizes on individual’s success through
individual hard work, virtue, and honest work. If he fails, he has no one but </p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00049">49</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:49 </h1>
<p>
   himself to blame, for he has vices, is idle and has bad habits. The typical
‘victimblamer’ is a middle -class person who is enjoying reasonably good
material success and has a good job and steady income. He says: “I had to
struggle to make it; why can’t the poor? There must be something wrong with
them”. Spencer, Carnegie and Lane believe in this ideology. </p>

<h1> Culture or Sub-culture of Poverty </h1>
<p>
The second cause of poverty is the culture of poverty, or the way of life of the
poor. Such a culture blocks all attempts of the society to change the values,
norms, beliefs and lifestyle of the poor. The ‘culture of poverty’ concept
suggests that despite economic changes, the poor have remained so because of
their culture or subculture. The culture of the poor fosters behaviour and values
associated with poverty; it has kept the poor out of the mainstream of industrial
society. Oscar Lewis popularized the notion of culture of poverty in 1959. He
maintained that it was a special culture that passes on poverty from generation
to generation. This conservative concept, often shared by the politicians and the
public, has given our society a reason for doing little or nothing about the poor
and poverty as a social problem. Advocates of this ideology identify lower-class
culture and assume that the lifestyle of the poor is the cause of continued
poverty. Ryan and Chilman believe in this school of thought. </p>

<h1> Social Structure </h1>
<p>
While ‘individual’ and ‘culture of poverty’ are accepted as causes of poverty
by the conservatives, the liberals, the radicals, and the sociologists link
poverty to social structure or to “miserable and unjust social conditions”. Our
social institutions, our economy, low educational attainment, lack of
employable skills, long-term unemployment or underemployment cause and
perpetuate poverty. Change in social and economic structures is not brought
about, or hindered by the vested interests. Sociologist Herbert Gans has
pointed out to three functional gains—economic, political and social—that the
middle-class derive from having a poverty-group in society. These range from
getting society’s ‘dirty work’ done to preserving one’s high status or keeping
oneself in power. Thus, the fault of poverty lies with those individuals/ groups
who do not want to change the social structure, values and norms for their
vested interests. </p>

<p> In Indian context, the causes of poverty may be described as under: </p>

<p>
(i) Rapidly rising population
The population during the last 45 years has increased at the rate of 2.2 per cent
per annum. On average 17 million people are added every year to its
population which raises the demand for consumption goods considerably. </p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00050">50</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:50 </h1>
<p>
(ii) Low productivity in agriculture
The level of productivity in agriculture is low due to sub-divided and
fragmented holdings, lack of capital, use of traditional methods of cultivation,
illiteracy etc. </p>
<p>
(iii) Under-utilized resources
The existence of underemployment and disguised unemployment of human
resources and under-utilization of resources have resulted in low production in
agricultural sector. This has also brought a downfall in their standard of living. </p>
<p>
(iv) Low rate of economic development
The rate of economic development in India has been below the required level.
Therefore, there persists a gap between level of availability and requirements
of goods and services. The net result is poverty. </p>
<p>
(v) Price rise
The continuous and steep price rise has added to the miseries of poor. It has
benefited a few people in the society and the persons in lower income group
find it difficult to get their minimum needs. </p>
<p>
(vi) Unemployment
The continuously expanding army of unemployed is another cause of
poverty. The job seekers are increasing in number at a higher rate than the
expansion in employment opportunities. </p>
<p>
(vii) Shortage of capital and able entrepreneurship
Capital and able entrepreneurship have important role in accelerating the
growth. But these are in short supply making it difficult to increase
production significantly. </p>
<p>
(viii) Social factor
The social set-up is still backward and is not conducive to faster development.
Laws of inheritance, caste system, traditions and customs are putting
hindrances in the way of faster development and have aggravate. the problem
of poverty. </p>
<p>
(ix) Political factors
The Britishers started lopsided development in India and reduced Indian
economy to a colonial state. They exploited the natural resources to suit their
interests and weaken the industrial base of Indian economy.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00051">51</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:51 </h1>
<p>
     In independent India, the development plans have been guided by
political interests. Hence, the planning has not been successful to tackle the
problems of poverty and unemployment (http:/www.preservearticles.com). </p>
<p>
     Concluding the discussion on the causes of poverty, it may be said that
poverty in India needs to be perceived in relationship to three factors: (i)
diverse historical and cultural roots of Indian attitudes, ideas, beliefs and
values, that is, people’s strong linkages with the past; (ii) fundamental
relationship between the biological and psychological characteristics of man;
and (iii) changes in Indian society pertaining to public policy, particularly
during and after liberation from the British rule. As such, if poverty existed in
India, it was because of the economic policies of the British government, lack
of incentives to the people, lack of education and technological knowledge,
lethargy, callousness and exploitation of the rural people, and religious and
social barriers to control the family size. If after independence efforts are being
made to contain poverty, it is through family planning, new industrial and
agricultural policies, spread of education, and giving subsidy and training to
the needy people. </p>
<p>
     Has the economic programme of structural reforms initiated after
mid-1991 reduced poverty? It is being claimed that industrial growth is
picking up gradually, rate of inflation is declining, exports are picking up, and
more employment is being created. But can we really assure prosperous future
to our people? The fact is that economic growth rate fell to decade’s low of 5
per cent in 2012—13. The inflation is constantly rising. The growth of exports
is very sluggish. Rupee has plunged to its all-time low. Industrial production is
depressed at just 3.5 per cent. Increase in agricultural growth is because
monsoon in last few years turned out to be very good in all areas. As such, the
possibility of not being able to face the setback cannot be ruled out. The phase
of managing economic crisis is bound to persist for many more years to come. </p>
<p>
      However, the combination of following measures may still prove to be
more helpful in reducing poverty: (1) reducing the fiscal deficits by the central
and the state governments; (2) lifting import restrictions and boosting up
exports; (3) controlling the borrowings; (4) selling units in public sector which
are constantly undergoing losses; (5) collecting more taxes; (6) improving cost
effectiveness by monitoring welfare expenditure; (7) making additional funds
available in the field of trade and commerce and controlling the bank rate as
well as the capital erosion by making the realization of bad debts easier; (8)
loans to the weaker sections of society may be provided at preferred rates
while the extent of subsidy may be kept within reasonable limits; (9) though
many licensing restrictions have been removed, there is since need to review
the remaining licensing items so that competition, intensified and dynamism </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00052">52</pagenum>

<p>
may be imparted to Indian industry; (10) lowering customs tariffs for making
the Indian economy internationally competitive; (11) removing constraints
on capital-intensive infrastructure industries, such as power, irrigation and
telecommunications so that these may develop competitive market structures;
(12) our labour legislation till now is so designed as to provide workers with
maximum security in terms of employment and wages. It is now time that
labour laws are linked with labourers’ performance and security is provided
both to the workers and the employers; (13) growth in agricultural economy
must be accelerated since two-third population is till dependent on
agriculture. This requires action on several fronts, including resolving the
problems of land tenure, raising the levels of investment, increasing avail-
ability of credit, ensuring appropriate pricing policies, developing new
technologies to increase productivity, decontrol of prices of certain fertilizers,
and setting up public investment in agriculture and rural development; (14)
integrating various schemes of rural development; and (15) reducing subsidies,
government expenditure and government employees. </p>
<p>
     If we unhaltingly go on with our reforms, we can overcome the severe
constraints on our economy, reduce poverty, and assure a prosperous future
for our people. </p>

<h1> Rural Poverty </h1>
<p>
The number of poor people in India, according to the country’s Eleventh
National Development Plan, amounts to more than 300 million. The country
has been successful in reducing the proportion of poor people from about 55
per cent in 1973 to about 27 per cent in 2004, but almost one-third of the
country’s population of more than 11 billion continues to live below the
poverty line, and a large proportion of poor people live in rural areas. Poverty
remains a chronic condition for almost 30 per cent of India’s rural population.
The incidence of rural poverty has declined somewhat over the past three
decades as a result of rural to urban migration. </p>
<p>
    Poverty is deepest among members of SCs/STs in the country’s rural
areas. In 2005 these groups accounted for 80 per cent of poor rural people,
although their share in the total rural population is much smaller. On the map
of poverty in India, the poorest areas are in parts of Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and West
Bengal. Large numbers of India’s poorest people live in the country’s
semi-arid tropical region. In these areas shortages of water and recurrent
droughts impede the transformation of agriculture that the Green Revolution
has achieved elsewhere. There is also a high incidence of poverty in
flood-prone areas such as those extending from eastern Uttar Pradesh to the
Assam plains, and especially in northern Bihar. </p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00053">53</pagenum>
<h1> Page no3 :5</h1>
<p>
Poverty affects tribal people in forest areas also, where loss of
entitlement to resources has made them even poorer. In coastal fishing
communities people’s living conditions are deteriorating because of environ-
mental degradation, stock depletion and vulnerability to natural disasters. </p>

<h1> Causes of Rural Poverty </h1>
<p> The following causes of poverty in rural areas may be identified: </p>
<p>
1.Inadequate and ineffective implementation of anti-poverty programmes.
2.Low percentage of population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits.
3.Non-availability of irrigational facilities and erratic rainfall in several
  states.
4.Low agricultural productivity resulting from dependence on traditional
  methods of cultivation and inadequate knowledge of modern skills
5.Non-availability of electricity for agricultural as well as industrial use in
  most of the villages.
6. Poor quality of livestock.
7. Imperfect and exploited credit market.
8. Lack of link roads, communication facilities and markets (i.e., infra-
   structure).
9. Low level of education. The general literacy level in the rural areas in the
   country is low while for females it is very low.
10.Absence of dynamic community leadership
11.Failure to seek women’s cooperation in developmental activities and
  associating them with planned programmes
12.Inter-caste conflicts and rivalries
13.Spending a large percentage of annual earnings on social ceremonies like
   marriage, death feast, etc., and people being unwilling to break the
   expensive customs. </p>

<h1> Action Plan for Alleviating Rural Poverty </h1>
<p>
For reducing poverty in the rural areas, following plan of action may be
suggested: </p>
<p>
1. Strengthening credit disbursing agencies.
2. Providing cheap power supply for agricultural and industrial use.
3. Activating cooperative societies for selling products of household industries
4. Making allocations in poverty alleviation programmes flexible and
   sanctioning special allocations to districts/ blocks/ villages showing good
   results.
5. Integrating varied poverty alleviation programmes in one or two
   schemes and making the availability of benefits easier.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00054">54</pagenum>
<h1> page no:54 </h1>
<p>
6.   Developing human resources by focusing on education, health and skill
     programmes.
7.  Introducing double distributive system for the destitutes and the
    extremely poor.
8.  Creating social awareness to arrest increasing debt growth among the poor.
9.  Improving animal husbandry and developing dairy and poultry farming
10. Activating panchayats to focus on adult education programme, road
    construction and maintaining tree plantations.
11. Activating NGOS in role-play like digging of tanks, tree plantations,
    training of youth, imparting skills to women, creating social awareness
    among the people, and so forth. </p>

<h1> Problems of the Poor and the Pains of Poverty </h1>
<p>
After 65 years of planning, India is still one of the poorest countries in the
world. Other countries, much smaller than India, have surged forward. Of the
world’s poor, every third person is an Indian, and the number is on the
increase. </p>
<p>
    Some of the variables on which the poor differ from others are degree of
participation in the labour force, kind of employment, characteristics of
family, degree of knowledge of the larger society, political awareness,
awareness of social and economic rights, and value orientations in politics,
religion and social customs. Ross and Blum (1967: 3941), however, maintain
that the poor are different but in matters of degree rather than of kind. </p>
<p>
    The important problems the poor in our society face are: (1) social
discrimination and social condemnation, (2) housing, and (3) subculture of
poverty. </p>

<h1>  Social Discrimination </h1>
<p>
The employers, the rich, the officials and even the government look down
upon the poor. They are considered lethargic, inefficient and a burden on the
society. They are harassed, humiliated and discriminated against at every level.
Being unrepresented and powerless, they are always the targets of attack and
hostility by the powerful. They have to face the challenges of illiteracy and
social prejudice. They lack collective power and whenever they make an
effort to unite at the local or micro level against the politically, economically
and socially stronger sections of the society (who view these efforts as threats
to their dominance) they are crushed. They are accused and labelled as undisci-
plined, immature, having very little foresight. They receive little or no
attention in offices they visit. Whenever a theft or a crime is reported to the
police, the police first rush to the areas inhabited by the poor as if it is only the
 </p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00055">55</pagenum>
<h1> page no:55 </h1>
<p>
poor who commit crimes. They are rarely considered reliable, dependent and
trust-worthy. The hostile attitude of the society at every stage thus, lowers
their self-image, creates in them a feeling of inferiority and curbs their efforts
of gaining means to help themselves. </p>

<h1> Housing </h1>
<p>
Houselessness, overcrowding, slums and rental laws are serious problems in
urban areas. The family’s dwelling unit and the neighbourhood within which it
is located are important elements in the problems associated with poverty. The
houses of the poor are not only overcrowded but lack privacy. The importance
of the housing design on the family is suggested by the postulation of two polar
types of family values: the familistic type and the emancipated type. The former
is characterized by strong feelings of fulfilling family obligations, providing
support and security to old, infirm and the unemployed in the family, identifi-
cation with family traditions, common efforts of members to achieve family
goals, and concern for family status. The latter lays emphasis on personal
pursuit of individual goals, restricted obligations to family, and subordination
of family welfare to individual welfare. In addition to the position of the family
in a continuum between these polar types of values, the neighbourhood too has
an influence on the members’ relations outside the home. In urban slums, a
considerable portion of family life is conducted outside the dwelling unit. The
darkness of the houses drives the children out into the streets creating problems
for the parents in controlling their children. The existing space does not permit
proper sleeping arrangements and forces an invasion of privacy. Family
tensions also affect their personality as well as their behaviour; self-respect is
eroded and cynicism fostered. Poverty forces living in the substandard houses
and leaves little for the prerequisites of decent living. The deficient housing
contributes to the weakening of family solidarity also. </p>

<h1> Sub-culture of Poverty </h1>
<p>
When poverty is transmitted over generations, it becomes a culture, according
to Oscar Lewis. Kriesgberg (1963: 335—36) has said that although the
membership of the poor changes to an important degree over the generations,
the successive generations resemble each. other in behaviour and values as a
product of the common experiences of being poor and of being subjected to
similar social pressures. The children of the poor inherit: a subculture of
violence in which physically aggressive responses are either expected or
required by all members. The use of violence in such a subculture is not
viewed as illicit conduct and the users do not have to deal with feelings of guilt
about their aggression. Violence becomes a part of the lifestyle, the medium </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00056">56</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: 56</h1>
<p>
for solving difficult problems and is used primarily between persons and
groups who themselves rely upon the same supportive values and norms. On
the one hand, this subculture is seen as the effect of poverty, that is, it refers to
the similarities in the behaviour and thinking patterns of the people, and on
the other hand, it is seen as the cause of poverty. </p>
<p>
     After 65 years of independence, the growth rate of income per capita has
not even tripled (from 1.5% during 1951-81 it has reached at just 4.2% during
1981-2009). In many countries, it has increased five or six times and, in the
case of Japan it is more than fifty times what it was immediately after the war.
The disparities between the poor and the rich are much more in India than,
say, in Europe or Japan. And, these are increasing, instead of narrowing
down. An average Indian cannot look beyond survival, and even bare survival
is now in doubt. </p>
<p>
     The system cannot provide either incomes or jobs. And, because there
are not enough jobs to go round—and there will never be as long as the
present system continues—they are being rationed just like other commodities
in short supply. </p>
<p>
     Though the government saved Rs 10 crore every year by abolishing the
privy purses of rulers, it is spending hundreds of crores every year on the
political maharajas. Today’s rulers have grand lifestyles. But who will dare to
attack these political maharajas who claim to be the nation’s policy makers? </p>
<p>
     When the policies of the top rulers of the country are based on vested
interests, self-righteousness and obduracy; when they think that they are the
only persons in the large country who have any feelings for the ‘oppressed’;
when they govern on the basis of caste versus class, rural versus urban, north
versus south, community versus community; when they have proved to be the
‘divisive force’ in the country; when their single-minded resolve to stay in office
spawns blood-letting and acts of violence; when the system has become highly
centralized and highly politicized and all political decisions are taken by a pack
of power-hungry, unscrupulous and corrupt decision-makers; when politicians
stick to political positions even after being defeated in elections only to escape
trials in courts; when the national income is not growing fast enough; and when
the political leadership is bankrupt, how can we expect that poverty in our
country will ever be alleviated and sufferings of the poor, mitigated? </p>

<h1> Strategies for Alleviating Poverty in India </h1>
<p>
Three distinct strategies for reducing poverty in India may be identified
(Tripati Rao, 1996):
(i) Initially, in the 1950s, the policy makers stressed maximization of
economic growth by stepping up investment assuming that the benefits </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00057">57</pagenum>
<h1> page no:57 </h1>
<p>
    arising out of it would ‘trickle down’ and diffuse among all sectors of the
society. But, in the 1970s, it was realized that the benefits of agricultural
growth did not percolate to the rural poor. </p>
<p>
(ii) This gave birth to the second approach led by the structural school
which pleaded for the establishment of egalitarian society and suggested
distribution of assets through land reforms, community development
programmes, cooperative farming, and nationalization of big industries.
But this also did not work. </p>
<p>
(iii) Then came the idea in the 1980s that suggested attack on poverty
through rural development programmes, such as IRDP, TRYSEM,
NREP and RLEGP, which later on merged in JRY programme. In
recent years, a landmark scheme to alleviate rural poverty in the
country, called Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), has been launched. </p>
<p>
     Before analysing these anti-poverty programmes, we shall first evaluate
the role of five-year plans, nationalization and 20-point programme in poverty
alleviation. </p>

<h1> The Five-Year Plans </h1>
<p>
The Planning Commission set up in 1950 has been formulating five-year plans
for country’s development taking an overall view of the needs and resources
of the country. Between the Third Plan, started in 1961 and the Fourth Plan,
started in 1969, three annual plans were also launched. </p>
<p>
     The First Five-Year Plan (1951-56) was designed to rectify the imbalances
created by the Second World War and the partition of the country in 1947
and the maladies persisting in the economy as a legacy of the British rule.
Though the plan aimed at achieving an all-round balanced development, it
accorded top priority to agriculture and irrigation investing 44.6 per cent of
the total plan budget on this sector. This was to reduce the country’s
dependence on agricultural imports and save foreign exchange. The industrial
sector was not assigned much importance in this plan and less than 5 per cent
of the plan outlay was spent on industries. However, the plan did give some
importance to the development of power, rural development (community
projects) and development of social welfare programmes. Of the total budget
of the plan (Rs 2,378 crore), only two—thirds (65.6%) was actually spent. At the
end of the plan, the country’s national income increased by 18 per cent and
per capita income by 11 per cent. </p>
<p>
The Second Five-Year Plan (1956—61) aimed at achieving rapid industrial-
ization of the economy and bringing about greater equality in income and
wealth for the establishment of a socialistic pattern of society in India. It stressed </p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00058">58</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:58 </h1>
<p>
that the benefits of development should accrue more to the relatively under-
privileged sections of society and that there should be a progressive reduction in
the concentration of income. It focused on the growth of basic and heavy indus-
tries, expansion in employment opportunities and increase of 25 per cent in the
national income. The total amount spent during this plan (Rs 4,672 crore) was
double the amount spent in the First Plan. However, the performance of the
plan did not justify the hopes that had been placed on it. Achievements in
almost all the sectors of the economy were lower than the plan targets. Conse-
quently, as against a near 13 per cent fall in price index during the First Plan, the
Second Plan witnessed a 12.5 per cent rise in price level. </p>
<p>
     The Third Five-Year Plan (1961—66) aimed at securing a marked advance
towards self-sustaining growth. It listed a set of five objectives, namely,
increase in annual national income by 5 per cent, self-sufficiency in
agriculture, growth of basic industries (like steel, power, chemicals),
maximum use of manpower resources, and decentralization of economic
power. Agriculture was once again given top priority and about 35 per cent of
the outlay was allocated to this sector. As compared to this, 23 per cent was
accounted to industries and 25 per cent to transport and communications.
The plan aimed at increasing the national income by about 30 per cent and the
per capita income by about 17 per cent. The total amount spent (Rs 12,767
crore) during the plan period was 9 per cent more than the allocated amount
(Rs 11,600 crore). </p>
<p>
    The performance of the Third Plan was also as disheartening as that of
the Second Plan. Over the five year period, the national income grew by 2.6
per cent as against the target of 5 per cent. In the agricultural sector also, the
production suffered a setback. The industrial production turned out to be 7.9
per cent as compared to the target of 11 per cent. The price index in 1965—66
was 32 per cent higher than in 1960-61. The Indo—Pakistan war, the
Sino—Indian conflict, and the successive failures of the monsoon were the
factors beyond human control. </p>
<p>
     The shape of the economy was in fact so bad at the end of the Third Plan
that the Fourth Plan, which was to be launched in March 1966 had to be
abandoned and was replaced by three annual plans. The three-year period
between 1966 and 1969, sometimes described as a period of ‘plan holiday’, was
devoted to rectifying the ills that had crippled the planning process during the
operation of the Third Plan. The main objective of the three annual plans was
to continue the unfinished tasks of the Third Plan. </p>
<p>
The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-74) aimed at increasing national income
by 5.5 per cent, creating economic stability, reducing inequalities in income
distribution, and achieving social justice with equality. Simultaneous growth </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00059">59</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:59 </h1>
<p>
of both agricultural and industrial sectors was fully recognized under the
Fourth Plan. Though the total amount spent during this plan was Rs 22,862
crore, this plan could not ensure economic growth. Neither could it achieve
self-sufficiency in foodgrains, nor could the generation of employment oppor-
tunities make any significant dent in the widespread unemployment problem.
The inflationary situation was also aggravated. With 1960—61 as the base, the
wholesale price index jumped from 165.4 in 1968-69 to 281.7 by the end of
1973—74, an increase of 70 per cent in a five-year period. </p>
<p>
     The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974—79) was formulated when the economy
was facing severe inflationary pressures. It mainly aimed at removal of
poverty and attainment of self-reliance. The aim was to bring larger sections
of the poor masses above the poverty line by assuring a minimum income of
Rs 40 per person per month calculated at 1972—73 prices. The plan also aimed
at an increase in employment opportunities, self-sufficiency, policy of
minimum wages, removal of regional imbalances, and encouragement of
exports. The plan targeted an annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent in the
national income. </p>
<p>
     The plan ended during the Janata regime in 1978 instead of 1979 and the
Sixth Plan was started as the ‘rolling plan’. But, when the Congress once again
came to power in 1978, the period of the Fifth Plan was described as being
from 1974 to 1979. The Fifth Plan was uniquely unlucky. It was indeed a
collection of annual development programmes. It could not achieve its targets
in any field, except in the increase of foodgrains. </p>
<p>
     The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980—85) was formulated after taking into
account the achievements and shortcomings of the past three decades of
planning. Removal of poverty was the foremost objective of the plan, even
though it was recognized that this objective could not be achieved in a short
period of five years. Stress was laid on economic growth, elimination of
unemployment, bringing down of inequality in the distribution of income,
self-sufficiency in technology, raising the lifestyles of the weaker sections of
society, improving the public distribution system and control of the
increasing population. The total amount spent during this plan was Rs
1,58,710 crore. </p>
<p>
     This plan made a fairly convincing success. The growth target of 5.2 per
cent envisaged in the plan was actually exceeded. According to NSS (National
Sample Survey), the proportion of people living below the poverty line
declined from 48.3 per cent in 1977—78 to 36.9 per cent in 1984—85.</p>
<p>
     The Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985—90) had three priorities of increasing
food, work and productivity. With its emphasis on generating substantial
productive employment, the plan aimed at a significant reduction in the </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00060">60</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:60 </h1>
<p>
incidence of poverty and an improvement in the quality of life of the poor.
The poverty ratio was expected to decline from 37 per cent to 26 per cent by
1990. The plan had a total allocation of Rs 1,80,000 crore (Rs 3,48,148 crore at
1989—90 prices). However, this plan also failed totally in achieving its targets.
There was a severe setback on the agricultural front, in the manufacturing
sector, in creating employment, and in the balance of payments position of
the country. </p>
<p>
     The Eighth Five- Year Plan (1992-97) which was to be started in 1990 was
actually enforced from April 1992. The 1990—91 and 1991—92 years were
considered to be yearly plans. The Eighth Plan’s total budget was of Rs
7,98,000 crore at 1990-91 prices. This means that the country spent about Rs
159.6 thousand crore a year or about Rs 3,069 crore a week. Of this amount,
45 per cent was spent by the government, and 55 per cent by private industries
and business. </p>
<p>
     The plan was supposed to be oriented towards employment generation.
More investment was supposed to be made in small industries which were
expected to be job-intensive. The plan aimed at achieving an overall GDP
growth rate of 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent, agricultural growth rate of 5 per
cent, industrial growth rate of 7.5 per cent, service sector growth rate of 8 per
cent to 10 per cent and export growth rate of 10 per cent. The plan size was
nearly the double of the previous plan but then all plans have been twice the
size of the previous plans. The growth rate was also more or less what the
previous plans aimed at. The fact that they rarely reached the target except in
the First and the Sixth Plans is a different matter. The Eighth Plan was thus no
different from the earlier plans, and its results also were no different either. </p>
<p>
    The plan failed to achieve most of its targets. For example, in power
against the set target of 31,000 MW, only about 15,000 MW (or 48% of the
target) are available at the end of the Plan. Resource mobilization by the states
is nowhere in sight. On the contrary, many states have diverted plan funds to
meet day to day expenditure. The implementation of various projects in the
plan was so indifferent and careless that an additional amount of Rs 21,000
crore had to be paid by the exchequer on account of delays and the conse-
quent rise in the cost of plan projects (The Hindustan Times, January 20,1997). </p>
<p>
     The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997—2002) was described as ambitious and
growth-oriented. The plan’s thrust areas were: agriculture, employment,
poverty and infrastructure. In agriculture, the top priority was to be given to
irrigation. The target for annual growth rate of GDP was 7 per cent of which
4.5 per cent was to come from agriculture and 9.3 per cent from industry. In
the Eighth Plan, the target was 5.5 per cent and the actual achievement was 6.2
per cent. The Ninth Plan aimed to encourage small-scale labour-intensive </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00061">61</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:61 </h1>
<p>
industrial development with appropriate incentives. The target for public
savings was 26.2 per cent of the GDP as against 23.7 per cent during the
Eighth Plan. The improvement was to come about through improvement in
tax structure. The planned reforms were expected to phase out obsolete
technologies and usher in higher material and energy efficiency. The
efficiency and productivity of five infrastructure sectors—irrigation, power,
mining, railways and communication—was also expected to improve. The
plan was described as ‘delivery—oriented’. </p>
<p>
     The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002—07) was approved by the National
Development Council (NDC) on 21 December 2002. It further developed the
NDC mandated objectives of doubling the per capita income in ten years and
achieving a growth rate of 8 per cent of GDP per annum. Since economic
growth was not the only objective, the plan aimed at harnessing the benefits
of growth to improve the quality of life of the people by setting the following
key targets: reduction in the poverty ratio from 26 per cent to 21 per cent by
2007; decadal population growth to reduce from 21.3 per cent in 1991—2001 to
16.2 per cent in 2001-11; growth in gainful employment, at least, to keep pace
with addition to the labour force; all children to be in school by 2003 and to
complete five years of schooling by 2007; reducing gender gaps in literacy and
wage rates by 50 per cent; literacy rate to increase from 65 per cent in
1999-2000 to 75 per cent in 2007; providing potable drinking water to all
villages; infant mortality rate to be reduced from 72 in 1999—2000 to 45 in
2007; maternal mortality ratio to be reduced from four in 1999-2000 to two in
2007; increase in forest/ tree cover from 19 per cent in 1999—2000 to 25 per
cent in 2007; and cleaning of major polluted river stretches. </p>
<p>
     The Eleventh Five-Year Plan: The Planning Commission of India first
started talking of ‘inclusive growth’ as an objective while formulating the
Eleventh Plan which was in operation from 2007 to 2012. But we find that
while this plan succeeded in achieving a remarkable rate of growth, it also
witnessed impoverishment and exclusion of large sections of the populations
from benefits of development. This was because of the singular focus of the
planners on growth and not on distribution with the assumption that accel-
erated growth would trickle down to benefit all. Unfortunately, this has not
happened. On the contrary, the disparities seem to have increased. </p>
<p>
     Despite an average 7.9 per cent growth in GDP (Gross Domestic
Product) during the Eleventh Plan period—sometimes also peaking to 9 per
cent—the performance of India in terms of the Human Development Index
(indicative of inclusive growth and the extent of population benefiting from
development) saw a downward slide from 128th and 127th positions in 2000 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00062">62</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:62 </h1>
<p>
and 2005 respectively to 134th position in 2009 and 2011. While a handful are
reaping benefits and have entered the billionaires club, millions are being
forced into deprivation and disempowerment. For the first time in history,
four Indians found a place amongst the 10 richest people of 2009, but three out
of every ten poor people in the world in the same year were also Indians —an
unusual phenomenon of continuing poverty and marginalization in the midst
of galloping plenty. </p>
<p>
      If we make an appraisal of all the eleven plans completed so far, we find
that we have completed six—and—a—half decades of planning. All our plans have
been oriented towards something—sometimes self-reliance in agricultural
production, sometimes employment, sometimes industrial growth, and so on. </p>
<p>
      During the period from 1950—51 to 2002—03, the national income had
increased by 8.7 times from Rs 1,32,367 crore to Rs 11,56,714 crore (at
1993—94 prices), implying a compound growth rate of 4.2 per cent per annum.
The per capita income had increased three times from Rs 3,687 to Rs 10,964
(at 1993-94 prices) registering a compound growth rate of 2.1 per cent—all the
aggregates measured at factor cost at 1993—94 prices. </p>

<p>
Note: The growth targets for the first three plans were set with respect to national income. In the
      Fourth Plan it was the Net Domestic Product. In all plans thereafter, it has been the Gross
      Domestic Product at factor cost. </p>
<p>
     Table 1 gives the growth performance of the Indian economy in terms of
GDP, relative to the targets set in the various plans right since the inception of
planning in India. The economy has performed better than the target in five
of the nine previous plans, and even in the Second Plan, the gap was not large.
As far as the Third and Fourth Plans are concerned, the shortfalls were largely </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00063">63</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:63 </h1>
<p>
due to severe exogenous shocks that could not possibly have been predicted
including the drought years of 1965 and 1966 and the Indo—Pakistan war of
1965. The Fourth Plan experienced three consecutive years of drought
(1971—73) and the first shock of rises in oil price of 1973. More importantly,
since the Fourth Plan, the growth rate of the economy had improved steadily
until the Ninth Plan, when it received a setback. Thus, the evidence suggests
that the track record of planning in India has been reasonably good, and
indeed tends to err on the side of caution. </p>
<p>
      During the Tenth Plan, the average GDP growth for the first three years
was 6.5 per cent and it was anticipated that the average growth rate is likely to
be below 7 per cent in the Tenth Plan period, well short of the target of 8 per
cent. Growth in 2005-06 was projected to accelerate to 7.6 per cent and could
accelerate further if the corrective steps were speedily implemented. An
important reason for lower growth rate was that investment did not increase
in line with available investable resources and a decelerated growth in
agriculture sector. </p>
<p>
     Increase in the price of oil led to serious problems of inflation in
mid-2004 but it has since been under control. Private sector investment had
revived after a long phase of dormancy. The Tenth Plan had created a
favourable climate for the development of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
The external payment position was comfortable with substantial inflows. The
performance of industrial sector had improved in 2004—05 after a dull record
in first two years of Tenth Plan period. The average of first three years was 7
per cent with considerable success in the field of manufacturing sector,
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, automobiles, auto components, etc., other
than IT sector (India, 2008). </p>

<h1> Nationalization </h1>
<p>
The policy of nationalization was adopted in 1969 when 14 banks were nation-
alized. This was followed by the nationalization of coal mines in 1972 and the
govemment’s taking over the control of a big private iron and steel company
and a wholesale business in foodgrains. The nationalization aimed at granting
credit to weaker sections. It is true that the credit share of banks to property
sectors like agriculture, small-scale industry, professionals and transport
operators has risen sharply after nationalization—from 14.6 per cent of net bank
credit in 1969 to nearly 37.8 per cent in 1994 and 41.8 per cent in 1998—and is
increasing continually even after at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent, which has
resulted in the modernization of nation’s economy, but nationalization has
some negative effects too. Judged from the standpoint of efficiency, the </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00064">64</pagenum>
<h1> page no:64 </h1>
<p>
quantum of profits, the standard of service to the general public or even deposit
mobilization, the banks have not been the pace-setters which the government
claims them to be. Lack of efficiency, initiative and commitment have been the
casualties of nationalization. Only in two areas—branch expansion and grant of
credit to the weaker sections—have the banks done better than expected. The
loans advanced by the banks are not given to the really needy people but are
sanctioned to people having some political or social backing. Most of these
loans are never recovered. In 1990, when the V.P. Singh government came to
power, it announced the policy of waiving loans below Rs 10,000 of the
farmers. While both the central and state governments were to share the
burden, the Centre’s liability alone was expected to vary between Rs 2,600
crore and Rs 3,000 crore. The entire farm loan waiver scheme cost the
exchequer more than Rs 10,000 crore. Again, in 2010, the government came out
with another farm loan waiver scheme costing more than Rs 50,000 crore to the
nation’s exchequer. Many economists have described these schemes as being
detrimental to the economy, as they do not contribute anything to the
sustainable development of the country. </p>

<h1> 20-Point Programme </h1>
<p>
Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi propounded this programme in July
1975 for reducing poverty and economic exploitation, and for the upliftment
of the weaker sections of the society. The five important goals of this
programme were: (a) controlling inflation, (b) giving incentive to production,
(c) welfare of the rural population, (d) lending help to the urban middle
classes, and (e) controlling economic and social crimes. The programmes
included in the 20—point programme were: increase in irrigational facilities,
increase in production programmes for rural employment, distribution of
surplus land, minimum wages to landless labourers, rehabilitation of bonded
labour, development of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs),
growth of housing facilities, increasing power production, family planning,
tree plantations, extension of primary health facilities, programmes for the
welfare of women and children, increase in primary education, strengthening
of the distribution system, simplification of industrial policies, control of
black money, betterment of the drinking water facilities, and developing
internal resources. </p>
<p>
     The programme was discontinued with the change of government,
when the Janata Party became the ruling party at the Centre. However, in
January 1982, the programme was again implemented with a revised format.
Among other things, the revised programme included an increased tempo of
rural development and a direct attack on rural poverty, besides specific
schemes for the upliftment of the SCs and STs. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00065">65</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:65 </h1>
<p>
    In the light of the experience gained in the Sixth Plan period (1980—85)
the 20-point programme was restructured and revised in August 1986. This
restructured programme aimed at eradicating poverty, raising productivity,
reducing income inequalities, removing social and economic disparities and
improving the quality of life. The 20-point programme in the restructured
plan of 1986 contained the following commitments: attack on rural poverty,
strategy for rainfed agriculture, better use of irrigation water, bigger harvests,
enforcement of land reforms, special programmes for rural labour, clean
drinking water, health for all, two-child norm, expansion of education, justice
to SCs and STs, equality for women, new opportunities for youth, housing
for the people, improvement of slums, new strategy for forestry, protection of
the environment, concern for the consumer, energy for the villages, and a
responsive administration.</p>
<p>
     The fact that the rural people and the urban poor are more discontented
and feel more frustrated today points to the failure of the 20-point programme
in fulfilling its commitments.</p>

<h1>  Poverty Alleviation Programmes </h1>
<p>
Several poverty alleviation programmes have been launched by the
government for the rural poor, comprising the small and marginal farmers,
landless labourers and rural artisans, as well as urban poor. These poverty
alleviation programmes are classified into (i) self-employment programmes;
(ii) wage employment programmes; (iii) food security programmes; (iv) social
security programmes; and (v) urban poverty alleviation programmes. Here,
we will be discussing mainly those programmes/ schemes that are targeted for
the benefit of rural poor. </p>

<h1> Integrated Rural Development Programme </h1>
<p>
Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) can be viewed in different
ways with special emphasis on its objectives, content, process, structure,
outcome and effect. The programme had been thought about because
according to the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the project or sectoral approach was
not adequate for overall development of the area and distribution of benefits
to the local population, particularly the weaker sections of the society. </p>
<p>
     It was, therefore, necessary “to plan for integration of various
programmes and to establish appropriate linkages for optimal utilization of
local endowments, consistent with the plan objectives, local needs and
environment balance”. At the planning stage itself the integration was thought
of as a clubbing together of various programmes for total development. </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00066">66</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:66 </h1>
<p>
    The need for total development was not occurred all of a sudden because
it had a long history behind it. Community development was introduced
with so much enthusiasm and everyone expected that it would bring changes.
However, the Balwantrai Mehta Committee (1957) found it to be a failure and
suggested a three—tier system of administration to enhance the participation of
people. </p>
<p>
     Though the Panchayati Raj system was introduced in many states, it was
not uniform in many ways and made the system more politically inclined and
catered more to the elite, the high class and high caste people. Such an admin-
istration could not create a healthy atmosphere for the effective
implementation of the developmental activities. On the contrary, many a
time it had been a hindrance. Of course, in states like Maharashtra and
Rajasthan, the Panchayati Raj system is functioning well in implementing
developmental activities. </p>
<p>
     In the early 1970s, a separate registered body was introduced. It became a
turning point in the administration of development activities. The change in
the administrative pattern aimed at efficiency and effectiveness in the
functioning. Under this, small farmers development agency (SFDA) and
marginal farmers and agricultural labourers agency (MFAL) and a few more
programmes were made part of it. </p>
<p>
     In the Sixth Plan, it was stated that none of the programmes had so far
covered the whole country and multiplicity of programmes for the rural poor
were operated through multiplicity of agencies. This needed to be stopped,
and replaced instead, by one single integrated programme operative
throughout the country. The programme will be called Integrated Rural
Development Programme (IRDP). </p>
<p>
     IRDP was thus conceived as an assault on poverty. The main purposes of
this programme were to identify and provide assistance by providing produc-
tivity assets, technology and skills to the families below the poverty line, to
enable them to cross poverty line, to maximize the employment opportu-
nities, to increase the income of the rural folk and also to increase the food
production. </p>
<p>
     The total number of rural households, according to the 1981 Census,
was 90.87 million. Considering that 50 per cent of the rural households live
below poverty line, it was estimated that 45 million of the rural households
were living below poverty line. IRDP was designed to assist the 15 million
rural households that were living below poverty line to cross the poverty line
by the end of the Sixth Plan. </p>
<p>
     IRDP covered 3,000 families in a block in the Sixth Plan, of which 30 per
cent had to be SC and ST families. Furthermore, at least 30 per cent of the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00067">67</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:67 </h1>
<p>
resources invested in terms of subsidies given and credit distributed had to go
to the SC and ST beneficiaries. Out of the total families, two-thirds had to be
assisted under agriculture and allied activities, and one-third had to go to the
secondary and tertiary activities.</p>
<p>
    The small farmers had to get 25 per cent subsidy whereas marginal
farmers, agricultural labourers, non-agricultural labourers and rural artisans
were to get 33.3 per cent subsidy. The beneficiaries belonging to STs will get
50 per cent subsidy. The maximum subsidy that could be given to a non-tribal
beneficiary was is Rs 3,000 while the tribal ceiling was Rs 5,000. </p>
<p>
    The activities of IRDP were spread over primary, secondary and tertiary
sectors. Apart from these activities, some other programmes were also
brought together for administrative convenience, such as employment,
training, irrigation and income enhancement. </p>
<p>
    The inputs in terms of assets, skills and technology were provided for
different activities. The financial assistance varies from Rs 500 to Rs 9,000
depending up on the unit size and trade. The unit cost has been fixed by the
District Consultative Committee and it is based on the guidelines given. </p>
<p>
     During the Sixth Plan, an amount of Rs 35 lakh, to be shared equally by
the state and the centre, was provided to, each block. The block had to
mobilize credit to the tune of Rs 75 lakh from the credit institutions. On the
whole, a block spent nearly Rs 105 lakh for a period of five years to raise 3,000
families above the poverty line.</p>
<p>
Assistance had to be provided to the poorest among the poor, in other
words, ‘antyodaya’ approach, had to be followed in selecting the beneficiaries. </p>

<h1> Indira Awaas Yojana </h1>
<p>
The scheme was primarily launched to provide grant for the construction of
houses to the members of SCs and STs, freed bonded labourers and to
non-SC/ ST rural poor who live below poverty line. Though it was launched
by the central government during 1985-86, under the Rural Landless
Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP), it became a sub-scheme under
Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY), and since January 1, 1996, it has become an
independent scheme. </p>
<p>
     The target group covered under this scheme has now been extended to
ex—servicemen, widows, next-of—kin of defence personnel and paramilitary
forces killed in action, irrespective of the income criteria, subject to the
condition that they (a) live rural areas, (b) so far have not been covered under
any other project, and (c) are in need of shelter or house upgradation. There is
a 60 per cent reservation for the SC and ST categories and non-SCs and STs
constitute the remaining 40 per cent. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00068">68</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:68  </h1>
<p>
      The identification of beneficiaries is done by the Gram Sabha after
getting the allotment list for each panchayat from DRDA/Zila Parishad.
There is no approval required from the panchayat union for the selection
done by the Gram Panchayat, provided the order of priority for selection
shall be, according to the guidelines given in the IAY scheme. </p>
<p>
      The allotment of houses is done in the name of the womenfolk of the
family. Alternatively, it can be allotted in the name of both husband and wife.
The family labour contribute their entire labour to the construction of the
houses and no contractor is allowed in the construction of IAY houses. In
other words, the beneficiaries or the occupants construct the house with the
minimum engagement of skilled labour. </p>
<p>
      Low cost and durable technology and materials is used for the
construction, which should be eco—friendly in nature. The state government
provides all necessary information in this regard to the beneficiaries.
Provision for drinking water, fuel—efficient chullahs and sanitation is ensured.
The state governments also ensure environmental improvements through
social forestry. Involvement of NGOs in supervision, guidance and
monitoring of construction is encouraged and especially in the aspects of
sanitary latrines and smokeless chullahs. </p>
<p>
      The monitoring and evaluation is done by the respective state govern-
ments/ union territories through DRDA or other agencies. Reputed research
institutions are engaged to conduct evaluation studies and the reports shall be
submitted to the Government of India. Remedial action taken based on the
evaluation is also be reported to the central government. </p>

<h1> Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana—Gramin Awaas </h1>
<p>
Taking into consideration the magnitude and the urgency, the Government
of India decided to introduce a comprehensive programme to promote
housing among the rural poor living below poverty line. Though Indira
Awaas Yojana (IAY) is in operation, the Gramin Awaas Yojana is an
additional programme to provide rural shelter. The target group, identifi-
cation of beneficiaries, allotment of houses, priorities, location, involvement
of beneficiaries, monitoring and evaluation are similar to that of IAY. </p>
<p>
      The scheme was introduced in the year 2000—01 and Rs 104.79 crore was
allotted to focus on primary health, primary education, rural housing,
drinking water and nutrition. The important feature is that the coverage is
only rural areas. </p>

<h1> Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana </h1>
<p>
Explosion of population and failure of monsoon, natural calamities and other
similar factors lead into the problems of unemployment and underemployment </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00069">69</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:69 </h1>
<p>
in India and especially in villages. It was observed that the volume of those
unemployed or underemployed has increased from time to time and hence the
Government of India proposes various schemes for providing employment
opportunities with food security as it was envisaged that larger and efficient use
of available human resources is one of the effective ways of alleviating poverty,
reducing inequality and improving nutritional level. </p>
<p>
    With this background the Government of India merged the already
existing schemes such as Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS) and the
Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY) as a new scheme and named it
Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) with effect from 25 September
2001.</p>
<p>
   The SGRY has been primarily launched to promote additional wage and
employment in villages and thereby provide food security and improve the
nutritional level. In addition to that, the creation of community, social and
economic assets and infrastructure development in villages are the secondary
objectives. </p>
<p>
     As the programme is self-targeting in nature, it covers all the rural poor
who require employment, either unskilled or manual. Though it is a central
scheme 25 per cent of the share shall be borne by the concerned state govern-
ments; for the union territories the entire grant is supported by the central
government. However, the food grains supplied for this scheme shall entirely
be given by the central government free of cost. The target groups covered
under the scheme are agricultural labourers, marginal farmers, women, SCs,
STs, parents of child labour withdrawn from hazardous occupations, parents
of disabled children, etc. </p>
<p>
     This scheme is implemented through PRIs and special safeguards are
provided for women and weaker sections. The allocation to women is 30 per
cent and to SC and ST categories it is 22.5 per cent. Since food grains form part
of the wages, the beneficiary should be supplied with 5 kg of food grain a day. </p>
<p>
     The cash payment shall be in accordance with the Minimum Wages Act
and there should be equal remuneration for both men and women and they
shall be paid on a fixed day for every week. The committees for monitoring and
evaluation shall be constituted at the district, state and panchayat union level to
supervise the scheme. Periodical evaluation studies should be conducted and
reports should be sent to the central government in the proper format. </p>
<p>
    As a special component, the areas affected by calamity, especially for the
damages caused to agriculture, shall be aptly responded by this scheme in the
form of generating additional wage employment in the affected area after due
notification and acceptance by the Ministry of Agriculture. There are provi-
sions for reservation of certain percentage of food grains for this cause. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00070">70</pagenum>
<h1> Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Page no:70 </h1>
<p>
It is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at Hunger Free India by providing
food grains to the poor. The scheme was launched in 2000. It envisage the
identification of one crore families comprising around 5 crore poorest of the
poor people who would be supplied with 25 kg of food grains per month at
the rate of Rs 2 per kg for wheat and Rs 3 per kg for rice. </p>
<p>
     With the involvement of PRIs, local bodies and NGOs, the government
intended to implement the scheme more transparently by ensuring more
quality in the public distribution system. </p>

<h1>  National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme </h1>
<p>
The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was introduced in 2004
to cover all the rural BPL households by providing employment to the
eligible labourers. It was estimated that there were 3.86 crore households
living below the poverty line in 1999—2000. </p>
<p>
     The scheme envisaged guarantee to the eight categories of work such as
water conservation, water harvesting, drought proofing, irrigation canals,
renovation of traditional bodies, land development, floor control and rural
roads and connectivity. Total outlay estimated for this scheme is Rs 39,372
crore. The scheme guaranteed one hundred days’ wage employment of the
adult labourers belonging to unskilled and manual category. </p>
<p>
     The scheme also guaranteed uemployment allowance to the eligible
worker who is not offered work within the prescribed time limit of 15 days.
The allowance shall not be less than one-fourth of wage rate for the first 30
days and half of the wage rate for the subsequent days of the financial year. </p>

<h1> Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana </h1>
<p>
To commemorate the celebration of fifty years of our independence, the
Government of India has launched this scheme on 1 April 1999, incorporating
the already existing six central schemes into it as under: </p>
<p>
1.Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)
2.Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment (TRYSEM)
3.Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA)
4.Supply of Improved Toolkits to Rural Artisans (SITRA)
5.Ganga Kalyan Yojana (GKY)
6.Million Wells Scheme (MWS) </p>

<p> Hence, these six schemes ceased to exist from April 1999.</p>
<p>
     All the aspects of self-employment components under these six schemes
have been integrated into this scheme, such as organization of the poor into
self-help groups, training, credit, technology, infrastructure and marketing. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00071">71</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:71 </h1>
<p>
    Though the scheme is a central programme, 75 per cent of the funds are
met by the centre and the remaining 25 per cent by the concerned state
governments. </p>
<p>
     The various agencies involved in the implementation process are banks,
rural banks, cooperative banks, PRIs, district rural development agencies,
NGOs and technical institutions. </p>
<p>
     To help the ‘swarozgaris’ (SHGs) to increase the income level to Rs
2,000 per month within three years and to support at least 30 per cent of the
BPL families in each panchayat union to come out of the clutches of poverty
within five years, are the specific objectives of this scheme. To uplift the weak
and vulnerable sections, there are also provisions of reservation: for Scheduled
Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as high as 50 per cent, for women 40
per cent and for disabled 3 per cent so. </p>
<p>
    Subsidy under SGSY is given at the rate of 30 per cent of the project cost
or to the maximum of Rs 7,500. For SCs and STs, the subsidy is payable at the
rate of 50 per cent or to the maximum of Rs 10,000. For group of swarozgaris,
the subsidy is 50 per cent of the project cost subject to per capital subsidy of Rs
10,000 or Rs 1.25 lakh, whichever is less. </p>
<p>
    Minimum skill requirement for each activity is ascertained by the
agencies meant for this purpose. Once an individual or a group of individuals
is identified for assistance their training needs also are to be assessed. Those
swarozgaris having the required minimum skills are further put into the basic
orientation programmes such as record maintenance, marketing, product
costing, product pricing and familiarization with financial institution. The
resource persons should include bankers, BDOs, line departments, marketing
personnel, NGOs and trainers meant for this purpose. </p>
<p>
    The persons who require the minimum or additional skills will be given
training by government institutions, ITIs, polytechnics, universities, NGOs,
etc. The Swarozgaris are paid stipend if the training is for more than a week
and they become eligible only when they complete this training. </p>

<h1> Self-Help Groups </h1>
<p>
The scheme provides opportunities to organize SHGs from among the
families living below poverty line. Under this scheme, group activities are
given preference and progressively more funding is allotted for group activ-
ities. </p>
<p>
     The membership may range from 10 to 20 for a group. The group with
disabled persons may be organized even if the minimum number is five. The
group should not have more than one person from the same family and also
an individual should not be a member of more than one group. The group can </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00072">72</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:72 </h1>
<p>
be a registered group under the Societies Act or an informal group. The
individual or all the members of the group can benefit from the scheme.  </p>
<p>
     DRDA/ Zila Parishad 1n each district should initiate the process of social
mobilization for poverty eradication programmes by organizing them into
various groups, especially SHGs. </p>
<p>
Till recently 1.80 crore rural poor have been organised into SHGs under
this programme. Out of these, 47 lakh swarozgaris have been provided with
development support with an average per capita investment of Rs 21,000, which
includes Rs 7,500 as subsidy, 21.3 lakh swarozgaris belong to SCs and STs. </p>
<p>
     To sum up, in India, at the beginning of the new millennium, the
number of poor in the rural areas was 193.2 million. After independence,
poverty eradication has been one of the major objectives of the development
of planning process in India. Reduction of poverty is the prime issue for the
attainment of international goals—developing rural areas. Particularly the
dimensions relating to education, health and other basic services have been
systematically and progressively internalized in the planning process in India.
The central and the state governments are trying to make sufficient allocations
for the provisions of health, education and other facilities for the well-being of
the rural poor. Anti-poverty strategy and programmes have certainly
provided opportunities of employment and income to the rural people. The
success indicator is the decline of poverty ratio in the rural areas from 37.3 per
cent in 1993-94 to 27.1 per cent in 2000. </p>
<p>
     Thus, as a result of various anti-poverty programmes discussed above,
there was a significant decline in proportion of people living below poverty
line from 51.3 per cent in 1977—78 to 26.1 per cent in 1999-2000. The
percentages of rural and urban poverty were 53.1 and 45.2, respectively, in
1977-78, these declined to 27.1 and 23.6 per cent, respectively, in 1999-2000.
In absolute terms, particularly the number of rural poor declined from 264
million in 1977-78 to 193 million in 1999—2000. </p>
<p>
    Now, we come to discuss one of the landmark anti-poverty
programmes, which has marked a turning point in the history of such
programmes in India. </p>

<h1> MNREGS/MNREGA </h1>
<p>
   Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(MNREGS) aims at enhancing the livelihood security of people in rural areas
by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to a rural
household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It
was implemented all over India in 2005 with a welfaristic approach.
MNREGA is considered the first Act in its type which is more </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00073">73</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:73 </h1>
<p>
comprehensive in nature. It mainly provides right to demand work and earn
wages for their livelihood. It would be considered successful only when
deprived, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, women, and the disables included
in the programme got their benefits as declared in the provisions of the consti-
tution. The success of the MGNREGS is much of a hope for the civil society
fighting for the rights of the poor. It would be however a critique of the devel-
opment state if it fails to achieve its goals and deliver what it aims to through
its provisions. </p>
<p>
     However, in present time, within these few years of implementation,
there have been instances reported of corruption taking place in many states
of India in the recent times on one hand, while on the other hand efforts are
made to maintain transparency of information and also conduct regular social
audits to monitor MGNREGS jobs and funds granted for it. Although
MGNREGS is a demand—driven programme and the supply of work depends
on the demand made by the labourers, but it is the duty of the government to
carry out awareness programmes in such a way, so that the most deprived gets
maximum benefit of the scheme. The Act seeks to strengthen the natural
resource base of rural livelihood and create durable assets in rural areas. Effec-
tively implemented, MGNREGA has the potential to transform the
geography of poverty. </p>
<p>
    A long-standing struggle of social activists demanding right to life
resulted in the first round of success though the enactment of Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). The Act
Was passed on 5 September 2005 and came into force in February 2006. The
MGNREGS got launched in the 200 poorest and backward districts of 27
states of India. The programme is seen as a significant opportunity by the
government as well as civil society organizations to transform rural economy
in selected districts/ states as it guarantees 100 days employment per family
and provides adequate resources for the improvement of infrastructure
including productive assets of the village. The initial three quarters since
operationalization of the programme have been invested not only in building
systems and procedures but also in developing operational details. Further,
many states have moved towards effectively implementing the programme
and generating employment for the poor families. The process of implemen-
tation has therefore generated ground-level data at the household, village, and
panchayat levels about the initial bottlenecks and operational hurdles. </p>
<p>
     The goals of the scheme are as under:
0 Strong social safety arrangement for the vulnerable groups by
  providing a fallback employment source, when other employment
  alternatives are scarce or inadequate. Growth machinery for
  sustainable development of an agricultural economy. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00074">74</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:74 </h1>
<p>
0 Providing employment on area that results in chronic poverty, e.g.,
  drought, deforestation, and soil erosion.

0 Empowerment of rural poor through the processes of a rights—based
  law.

0 New ways of doing business, as a model of governance reform
  anchored on the principles of transparency and grassroots
  democracy. </p>
<p>
  Adult members of every rural household who are willing to do casual
manual work at the statutory minimum wage may apply to the Gram
Panchayat for registration. Registration is valid for a period not less than five
years and renewable. Employment is to be provided to every registered
person within 15 days of receipt of an application. Applications are to be for
at least 14 days of continuous work. Gram Panchayat is to accept valid appli-
cations and issue a dated receipt to the applicant. Applicants provided with
work to be notified in writing. Employment is to be provided within a radius
of 5 km. If work is provided beyond 5 km, it is to be provided within the
block, and the labourers paid 10 per cent of the daily minimum wages extra. </p>
<p>
   The Act was notified in 200 districts in first phase with effect from 2
February 2006 and then extended to additional 130 districts in the financial
year 2007-08 (113 districts were notified with effect from 1 April 2007, and 17
districts in UP were notified with effect from 15 May 2007). The remaining
districts have been notified under the MGNREGA with effect from 1 April
2008. Thus, MGNREGA covers the entire country with the exception of
districts that have a 100 per cent urban population. The scheme under this Act
will be implemented as a centrally sponsored scheme on a cost-sharing basis
between the centre and the states as determined by the Act. </p>
<p>
    Wages are to be paid every week not later than a fortnight. In case of
any delay in the payment of wages, labourers entitled to compensation as
per the Payment of Wages Act. No gender bias permitted. Provisions made
for compensation and treatment in case of injury and for on-site safe
drinking water, care of small children, periods of rest, and a first-aid box.
Contractors and labour displacing machines banned. At least 60 per cent of
the expenditure under any project is to be on wages. At least 50 per cent of
the projects, in terms of value, to be implemented through the Gram
Panchayats  which must prepare a development plan. The programme
officer will be responsible for the implementation of the employment
guarantee programme in the block. </p>
<p>
MGNREGS has thus marked a paradigm shift from all precedent wage
employment programmes. The significant aspects of this paradigm shift are: </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00075">75</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:75 </h1>
<p>
it provides a statutory guarantee of wage employment and rights-based
framework for wage employment. Employment is dependent upon the
worker exercising the choice to apply for registration, obtain a job card, and
seek employment for the time and duration that the worker wants. Unlike
the earlier wage employment programmes that were allocation based,
MGNREGS is demand driven? Resource transfer under MGNREGS is
based on the demand for employment and this provides another critical
incentive to states to leverage the Act to meet the employment needs of the
poor. It has inbuilt transparency safeguards documents: Job cards recording
entitlements (in the custody of workers) written application for
employment, muster rolls, measurement books and asset registers processes,
acceptance of employment application, issue of dated receipts, time-bound
work allocation and wage payment, Citizen Information Boards at
worksites, Vigilance Monitoring Committees, regular block, district- and
state-level inspections, and social audits. The public delivery system has been
made accountable, as it envisages an annual report on the outcomes of
MGNREGS to be presented by the Central Government to the parliament
and to the State Legislature by the State Government. Specifically, personnel
responsible for implementing the Act have been made legally responsible for
delivering the guarantee under the Act. </p>
<p>
  MGNREGS status as per government reports, within these few years of
time span, shows that more than 3.12 crore households were provided with
employment throughout the country. Around 122. 45 crore person-days were
created and 7.32 lakh assets were built, out of 26.14 lakhs taken up under this
programme. The national bulletin of MGNREGS also puts on view that out
of the total person-days created 50 per cent of the person days were occupied
by women labourers. Even though the data generated under MGNREGS
View a bright picture in terms of inclusion issues but the state- and region-wise
portrays a gloomy story all together. This could be due to some
persistent malpractices which prohibit the smooth implementation of this
Act in the diversified states of India. Thus, some states are performing well by
successfully including these socially excluded groups, whereas many other
states are lacking behind due to various implementation failures. This is an
important concern for all today. </p>
<p>
 In the year 2006—07 financial years after the implementation of the
MGNREGA all over India, we find the total expenditure under taken by the
central government was Rs 8,813 crore, respectively. Each district was
assigned a total amount of Rs 44.06 crore during the same financial year. The
MGNREGA employment generation for 2006—07 was 90 crore person—days
respectively as discussed above. The cumulative expenditure in 330 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00076">76</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:76 </h1>
<p>
 MGNREGS districts in financial year 2007—08 comes to Rs 10,133 crore as on
31 January 2008. This expenditure was sufficient only to provide an average of
35 days of employment per household. Thus, we would require nearly Rs
29,000 crore if we were to provide 100 days of employment to all households
seeking work across 330 districts. Extending this guarantee to all 604 districts
of India in 2008—09 would, therefore, require an expenditure of nearly Rs
53,000 crore, respectively. MGNREGS employment, in regard to person-days
per rural household, varied from state to state. </p>
<p>
    As the centre gears up to implement MGNREGA across all the districts
in the country, instances of corruption and irregularities in implementing the
scheme are tumbling out, e.g., fudged job cards, incomplete muster rolls,
missing names or signatures and more. A government-sponsored study on the
MGNREGA has found large-scale corruption and irregularities in the imple-
mentation of the programme in several states with authorities in some areas
misappropriating central funds and threatening workers to keep their mouth
shut. There was great fraud in the making of (job) cards, muster rolls were not
maintained properly and work was not provided to job seekers sometimes. In
many cases, workers performed one day’s job but their attendance was put for
33 days. The workers got money for one day while wages for 32 days were
“misappropriated by the people associated with the functioning of
MGNREGA. In fact, the workers were threatened to keep their mouths shut.
One of them mentioned that the MGNREGA had proved to be a boon for
the panchayat functionaries,” they said in the report. The study, sponsored by
the Rural Development Ministry, was initiated in September 2008. The
research team visited Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. They collected
secondary material and also elicited information from different stakeholders
such as the ‘Gram Pradhan’ and beneficiary workers, besides interviewing
implementing agencies and personnel. The study team found that in Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar, the job cards were
not in the possession of workers but with the Sarpanch and other panchayat
functionaries, while in many cases job cards were found to be fudged with
fake entries. In most of the cases, job cards were found in the possession of
Sarpanch or other panchayat functionaries. In many cases, it was found that
job cards were fudged and fake entries made. It is also noted that interpersonal
conflicts among project officers, block development officers, and the .
Sarpanch, saying this has affected the performance and efficiency of the
project officers. In some places, the Sarpanchas were using their political
clouts to trouble the POs. In some cases, the block development officers were
sore about snatching away of their signatory authority on NREGS cheques.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00077">77</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:77 </h1>
<p>
There should be a monitoring committee consisting of some members of the
civil society, along with the panchayat functionaries and beneficiary workers. </p>
<p>
     With similar views in mind, thus, the payment of wages into bank
accounts for work carried out under the MGNREGA has been suggested as a
way to prevent embezzlement of funds. The practice has already begun in
most districts of India. Wages are acquired from the bank by self or through
someone’s help from the family. The wage earner has to open an account on
the respective banks. The issue of delays in wage payments is one of the most
serious problems with the system of bank payments. Reports from several
states including Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal indicate that the problem of delayed
payments and dwindling interest in employment under the MGNREGA is
rampant across several states. It is a well-established argument that the
coverage of banks and post offices in rural India is patchy and as a conse-
quence workers especially in remote parts of the country find it difficult to
travel long distances to collect their wages causing delays in payments. Inter-
estingly, though findings from a survey in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand
indicate that close to 90 per cent of workers who lived more than 5 km from a
bank/ post office expressed a preference for bank payments over cash despite
the distance, indicating the deeper problems lie elsewhere. An important cause
of the severe delays in the disbursement of wages is the institutional incapacity
of rural banks to handle the huge volume of accounts. The shortage of staff
and technology is most acute in post offices where accounts are managed
manually through log journals. However, the cause of delayed payments is
more complicated than this. There are several bottlenecks associated with the
different steps in the wage payment process: Filling the muster roll, measuring
work and matching with attendance, preparing payment orders, sanctioning
of cheques by officials, and finally crediting of wages in workers accounts by
the bank. Centre-state financial norms are not always clear and often mired in
politics causing significant delays in the flow of funds from the central to state
governments. Although such delays legally entitle workers to unemployment
benefit, compensation has rarely been paid which is a clear violation of the
Act.The government has acknowledged this gap and has sought to rectify it
by directing state governments to ensure that the ‘twin legal mandates’ of
wage payment within 15 days and through institutional accounts are ‘scrupu-
lous1y adhered to’. A host of directives follow such as holding of a monthly
Gram  Rozgar Diwas at the panchayat level in which issues of payment
backlogs will be cleared, strict monitoring of timely payment of wages by the
District Programme Coordinator, etc. The ‘Business Correspondent Model’
which is currently being rolled out by the government is an attempt to
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00078">78</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:78 </h1>
<p>
address this problem of delayed payments and ensure that the rural poor have
timely access to financial services. How this works is that the business corre-
spondent would, on behalf of the banks, for a commission, deliver financial
services to ‘clients’ though appropriate technology such as handheld
computer devices. However, given that the problem of delays is more
complex than a simple issue of institutional access, the solutions might lie
beyond the scope of this administrative ‘innovation’. </p>
<p>
     While the move of separating the implementation and payment agencies
has countered the earlier forms of corruption such as siphoning of funds,
some forms of embezzlement have persisted and some new forms have
emerged. The first is through ‘deception’ where often the abhikarta (imple-
menting agency) in collusion with the bank officials withdraws money from
the accounts of workers without their knowledge. The second is through
‘exploitation’ where genuine workers withdraw their wages themselves but
are forced to hand over part of their money to the contractor or Sarpanch
based on a pre-decided ‘deal’. The third method is where workers ‘collude’
with the implementing agency and fake names are entered in the muster roll
on the basis of which wages are withdrawn. While the first type of embez-
zlement can be effectively dealt with through strict enforcement of certain
minimum safeguards such as ensuring money is only withdrawn by the
account holder. The other two types of embezzlement are perhaps more
difficult to counter because they are borne out of an essentially feudal, exploit-
ative set-up in which rural banks function. Taking strict action against such
corruption, the government has restated that unfair practices in the system of
wage payments will be punishable under Section 25 of the Act. However, the
record for invoking this clause has been quite abysmal. While enforcing this
penalty clause which allows for a fine up to  1,000 will ensure accountability
to some extent, there is a pressing need to restore transparency safeguards
already built into the Act. Public scrutiny of wages through reading out
muster rolls and regular updating of job cards needs to be reinstated. This is a
powerful practice because it enables workers to verify their attendance and
monitor wage payments themselves, thereby curbing corruption. The switch
to bank payments has without a doubt provided substantial protection against
embezzlement and is a critical step towards ensuring greater accountability in
the disbursement of wages under the MGNREGA. However, the issue of
delays in wage payment needs to be tackled swiftly by both streamlining
processes and mechanisms under the system of bank payments as well as
reinforcing traditional safeguards. </p>
<p>
     Worried over reports of the delay in wage payment to workers under
the MGNREGA, the government is considering a proposal to pay part of </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00079">79</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:79 </h1>
<p>
entitled wage in advance. The government has been unable to address the
problem of delayed wage payment. Part advance payment of wage to workers
would be taken up to keep the interest of workers in the scheme intact. In an
effort to curb pilferage in wage payment under the MGNREGA, more than 8
crore savings accounts have been opened with the PSU banks and post offices.
Still one is unable to pay wage on time as work measurements for wage
payment have become quite time consuming. On the banks and post offices
demanding 2 per cent service charges for operating MGNREGA workers
savings accounts, the issue is being dealt with.</p>
<p>
     The successful implementation of the scheme depends on the following:
(a) The capacity (including technical) and willingness of panchayats and
    local government to plan works and run the programme effectively.
(b) Dissemination about the programme and its guidelines to local people
    who can make use of it to register and demand for work.
(c) Mobilization to run social audits without fear of repression
(d) MGNREGA contains many safeguards in terms of transparency and
    accountability. These are likely to be resisted by vested interests at every
    level and should be continuously fought through local mobilization.
(e) Most evaluations official and non-official show that implementation has
    been more effective than any of its predecessor schemes.
(f) In particular, the leakages have been reduced significantly in many places.
(g) Significant rise in agricultural wage shows its success.
(h) The success of course is by no means uniform.
(i) Much needed relief during financial crisis even for the urban poor
    returning to rural areas.
(j) 11th Five-Year Plan indicates that MGNREGS is going to be one of the
    important programmes for poverty reduction in India.
(k) MGNREGS can not only transform livelihoods of the poor but also
    lead to revolution in rural governance. </p>

<h1> food Security Scheme (2013) </h1>
<p>
The scheme extends to the whole of India and shall be deemed to have come
into force from 5 July 2013. Priority households are entitled to 5 kgs of
foodgrains per person per month, and antyodaya households to 35 kgs per
household per month. The combined coverage of priority and antyodaya
households (called ‘eligible households’) shall extend up to 75 per cent of the
rural population and up to 50 per cent of the urban population. The PDS issue
prices would be Rs 3/ 2/ 1 per kg for rice/wheat/millets which may be revised
after three years. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00080">80</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:80 </h1>
<p>
     Similarly, children between the age 6 months and 14 years and pregnant
and lactating mothers are also entitled to free meal under the scheme. </p>
<p>
     The concerned Act does not specify criteria for the identification of
households eligible for scheme. It is left to state governments, and is to be
completed within a year. </p>
<p>
     The Act also provides for the creation of State Food Commissions aimed
to monitor the implementation of the scheme, give advice to the state govern-
ments and their agencies, and inquire into violations of entitlements. State
Commissions also have to hear appeals against orders of the District
Grievance Redressal Officer (DGRO). The Food Commissions have powers
to impose penalties. If an order of the DGRO is not complied with, the
concerned authority or officer can be fined up to Rs 5,000. State governments
must also put in place an internal grievance redressal mechanism which may
include call centres, help lines, etc. </p>
<p>
     Mandatory transparency provisions include: (1) placing all PDS—related
records in the public domain; (2) conducting periodic social audits of the PDS
and other welfare schemes; (3) using information and communication
technology to ensure transparent recording of transactions at all levels; and (4)
setting up vigilance committees at all levels to supervise all schemes under the
Act. </p>

<h1> Effective Measures for Poverty Alleviation </h1>
<p>
Poverty alleviation has to go hand in hand with a vigorous drive for reforms.
A former member of the Planning Commission suggested the following
measures for economic reforms in India (Sunday, November-December 1995:
67—69): </p>
<p>
1. Distribution of income: Not only income has to be increased by stimu-
lating policies of economic growth by the government (i.e., growth of
output and employment) but distribution of income has also to be given
importance in the country. The reforms must have a positive impact on
the poor.
2. Encouraging private investment: Investment of capital in private indus-
tries has lagged behind in our country. It can come if there is a belief that
profitability will increase over a period of time. Adopting liberalization
can assure such beliefs.
3. Raising resources and planning expenditure: Till private investment
increases, there has to be a substantial public investment in infra-
structure. This requires raising resources and planning expenditure. The
latter has to focus on cutting expenditure or reducing non-essential
expenditure and raising revenue. The revenue can be raised not by </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00081">81</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:81 </h1>
<p>
  increasing taxes but by increasing tax collection. At present, a very small
  fraction of people pay income tax. We have to double the number of
  those who should be taxed compared to what we have today. </p>
<p>
4. Containing inflation: Inflation may be contained by increasing
   production.
5. Creating independent banking institutions: In a market-based system, we
   must have institutions which are independent. We must, therefore,
   work for more autonomy of the Reserve Bank. But, the interest rates
   and the foreign exchange rate should not be entirety deregulated. The
   fundamental rates should be stable.
6. Reflaming of disinvestment policy: The policy pertaining to disin-
   vestment in public sector needs to be framed in such a way that if the
   unit is incurring losses, the government must get out. We have to have
   an exist policy. Then there are units which have to be improved. The
   government can sell their shares and use the money for improvement.
   But there are units which are making huge profits. Selling the shares of
   such units is quite like selling the assets. It is a bad policy. </p>
 <p>
    The economists thus believe that only economic reforms like these can
really help in reducing poverty in our country. However, the Leftists feel that
a mixed economic system in the country obstructs alleviation of poverty. The
absence of a minimum wage policy has increased discontentment among the
labourers who today take more interest in strikes than in increasing
production. The capitalists think that lack of free licensing policy has
hampered industrial growth. The socialists maintain that measures like
control over prices of manufactured commodities, fixing the profit margin of
industrialists, action against black money, and control over urban property
will alleviate poverty in the country. Intellectuals believe that change in the
tax structure, control over conspicuous consumption, reduction in adminis-
trative expenses, change in the distribution system and added incentives to
medium class entrepreneurs will contain poverty. </p>
<p>
     Broadly speaking, the measures for alleviating poverty can be classified
into four groups. (1) those affecting the demand for work; (2 ) those affecting
training in labour skill; (3) those affecting the transfer of income; and (4) those
affecting change in the existing social system. All these necessitate the
following measures for eradicating poverty or at least reducing it significantly. </p>

<h1> Creating Employment </h1>
<p>
The experience so far has shown that certain kinds of economic activities do
not create jobs. To this group belong all large industries, all industries using a
lot of capital, and all industries which require import of machinery, </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00082">82</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:82 </h1>
<p>
components and raw materials. These industries only produce goods which
increase the well—being of the upper and upper-middle classes. They generate
little employment on which the poor depend. As such, small and cottage
industries and agriculture which now remain neglected areas as employment
generating sources, need to be identified and the credit and tax incentives need
to be channelized more intensely to these areas. </p>
<p>
    Creating employment by such means as the MNREGS is not enough.
Now, initiatives in the eco—political policy are also needed. If the estimated 20
million people who are unemployed and therefore also unproductive become
productive in the process of being employed, they would become an
enormous productive asset for the community. </p>
<p>
Some new schemes for generating work and increasing income of the
poor people in villages could be: (i) dissemination of knowledge in
eco—technologies to cultivators; (ii) training in horticulture, tree plantation,
and use of unused lands; (iii) creating artisan units in villages; (iv) establishing
micro-enterprises for women; (v) establishing community facility centres; and
(vi) mobilizing role of NGOs in villages.</p>

<h1> Distributive justice </h1>
<p>
The problem of poverty is not necessarily the problem of GNP growth only
but of distribution also. It is true that wealth has to be created before it is
properly distributed among the different sections of the society but the
modality and extent of development also determine the level of benefits that
will trickle down to the poor who are the barometer of a society’s devel-
opment. And, hence, the necessity of the ‘reordering of priorities’ for
stopping the growing inequality between the rich and the poor. Total egalitar-
ianism in income and property may not be possible, but at least the laws can
be so enacted and implemented that the rich do not escape paying taxes, and
the land in villages may be protected from benami transfers and deals. </p>

<h1> Land-Man Ratio </h1>
<p>
While land cannot be increased, productivity can be increased by use of high
technology. Even small holdings can be made profitable by proper irrigational
facilities, use of modern techniques and by diversification. The land-man ratio
in India fell from 0.15 hectare per person in 1965 to 0.13 hectare per person in
1975 to 0.12 hectare per person in 1995, but the human dependence on land
increased from 60 per cent in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1996. Therefore, for a
country to prosper, industry must absorb most working people. The share of
agriculture in the US national income came down from 69 per cent in 1839 to
12 per cent in 1928 to 4 per cent in 1992 and is 3 per cent at present. This has
been the pattern in most developed countries. </p>

<h1> Controlling Population Growth, Page no:83 </h1>
<p>
If India’s population had been frozen by some miracle at the 1947 level (300
million), the growth achieved so far would have been enough to abolish
poverty completely. What has accentuated poverty is the lack of modern
outlook in the people. Its one evidence is that a large number of men and
women are not using the required methods for controlling the size of their
families. The primary task, therefore, should be to control population by
persuasion, if we can, and by coercion, if we must. It is also time to build a
political consensus on population control. Providing disincentives for more
than two children will also help in changing the outlook of the people which
in turn is necessary for control over population. </p>

<h1> Elimination of Black Money </h1>
<p>
Black money is unaccounted money, tax evaded, concealed income and undis-
closed wealth. Many ingenious ways are employed by industrialists, export
houses, the film industry, businessmen and the corporate sectors to hoodwink
the taxman in the ongoing game of hide and seek. This money is usually spent
on conspicuous consumption and corrupt practices to further generate
income and wealth. The Wanchoo Committee appointed by the Government
of India in 1970 to investigate the problem was of the view that tax evasion
and black money have reached such a stage in our country that they have
become a menace to our economy and a challenge to the fulfilment of the
avowed objectives of distributive justice and setting up of an egalitarian
society. Another report on black money was prepared in 1993 by the
National Institute of Public Finance under the chairmanship of Raja J.
Chelliah. According to this report, the present structure of high rates of
taxation and the range and complexity of control of the economic activities
lead to the creation of tax-evaded income. </p>

<h1> Decentralizing Planning and its Execution </h1>
<p>
For the success of such anti-poverty/ rural development programmes, it is
necessary that they should be planned by the village panchayats. Unless the
planning and its execution is decentralized, unless the families living in
poverty are objectively identified by individual village panchayats at the local
level, the programmes will not benefit the persons for whom they are made.
In the urban areas also, the municipal councils should plan the
self-employment programmes based on local resources and the skills of the
slum dwellers. Decentralized plans alone can help in reducing and ridding
ourselves of poverty. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00084">84</pagenum>
<h1> Other Measures, page no:84 </h1>
<p>
Besides the above-mentioned measures, the following measures can also
contribute to poverty alleviation: (1) Forming a time-bound result-oriented
action plan for rapid industrialization. The upsurge in industrial investments
will provide employment to millions of people. (2) Participation in the
emerging global markets. (3) Change in budgetary outlays to reduce irrelevant
government expenditure. (4) Generating power substantially, improving
transmission losses and controlling distribution. (5) Encouraging term-lending
institutions. (6) Providing seed money to voluntary organizations through
people-sponsored programmes. (7) Developing the mass rapid transit system
in big cities with the help of the Asian Development Bank. (8) Establishing
subsidized training centres for training youth in computers, electronic trade,
and small-scale industries. (9) Helping women to be self-reliant through a
carefully planned programme. (10) Constituting dedicated teams of
committed bureaucrats and technocrats in every state for formulating, imple-
menting and moderating job-oriented programmes. (11) Arranging full
participation and involvement of people in development programmes. (12)
Strengthening the PRIs so that they can become institutions of democratic
management of rural development both at the district and block levels. The
government officials at the district and village levels can provide technical,
managerial and marketing support on the one hand and on the other hand
stimulate social awareness and mobilize the poor households. (13) The help
of non-government organizations may be taken in the administrative
arrangements for the implementation of rural and urban development
programmes. It calls for keeping the formal staff to the minimum and
increasing the non-formal staff as part of full-time consultants drawn from
academic or voluntary organizations. Non-government organizations here
include professional/ technical institutes, polytechnics, agricultural univer-
sities, university faculties, management institutes, research organizations,
welfare/ voluntary organizations and professional resources of business
organizations and banking sectors. </p>
<p>
   Besides the above measures, some measures like land redistribution,
elimination of industrial monopolies, plugging of national drainage, efficient
and democratic management of public sector enterprises, also help in reducing
poverty in our country. </p>
<p>
  All these programmes will meet the challenges of the twenty-first
century in alleviating poverty. The eighth SAARC summit meeting at Delhi
in May 1995 had decided to designate 1995 as the ‘Year for Poverty Eradica-
tion’ and adopted an agenda for action which included: (i) a strategy for
mobilization of resources, (ii) policy of decentralized agricultural  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00085">85</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:85 </h1>
<p>
development, and (iii) small-scale labour-intensive industrialization. The
attack on poverty can provide a basis for a partnership between people,
government, voluntary agencies and industrialists. The community has to
assume responsibility not only towards the poor, the old, the infirm and the
absolute destitutes having no means of support but it has also to assist the
able-bodied poor and the unemployed or underemployed by helping them
become an integral part of a self-supporting population. The rich may
grumble about taxes and welfare schemes, the conservatives may keep on
talking about “too much government spending” but the anti-poverty
programmes are indispensable. The humanitarian concern for the poor is
greater now than ever before. </p>
<p>
    So long as we have a double mind about what path of developmental
style to adopt, we will fail economically in our goals. It is not lack of resources
or technical skills which are hindrances in our development, it is lack of the
political policies. Planning is to be based on the fact that poverty is not a cause
but a result. Elimination of poverty is not merely a question of economic
upliftment but is a social and a political issue related to the level of the polit-
ico-social awareness of people.  </p>

Unemployment, Page no:87
</h1>
<p>
A man has to perform many roles in his life, the most crucial of which is that
of an earning member. It is crucial not because a man spends approximately
one-third of his lifetime performing this role but because it determines both
his livelihood and status. It also enables an individual to support his family
and fulfil his social obligations to society. It makes possible for him to achieve
power, too. If a person, with a capacity and potential to work, refuses to work
or fails to obtain work, he not only does not gain any status in society but also
comes to suffer from several emotional and social problems. His plight affects
himself, his family, and the society too. No wonder, unemployment has been
described as the most significant sociological problem in society. Opportunity
for employment then becomes imperative in all such cultures which claim to
be democracies. Equal employment opportunity is a prerequisite for equal
accessibility to achieved status. Attempts to deal with unemployment have
hitherto been two-pronged: one, to alleviate the status of the unemployed,
and two, to abolish unemployment itself. After independence, though the
governments—both central and state—have taken the problem into their
hands, they have remained ineffective in tackling this and in providing assis-
tance to persons unable to support themselves. Unemployment is still viewed
as an economic rather than a social phenomenon. </p>
<p>
    What is unemployment? If a man with a PhD degree works as a petty
clerk in an office, he will not be considered an unemployed person. At most,
he would be viewed as an 'underemployed' person. An unemployed person is
"one who having potentialities and willingness to earn, is unable to find a
remunerative work”. Sociologically, it has been defined as “forced or </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00088">88</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:88 </h1>
<p>
involuntary separation from remunerative work of a member of the normal
working force (that is, of 15—59 age group) during normal working time at
normal wages and under normal conditions”. D’Mello (1969: 24) has defined
it as “a condition in which an individual is not in a state of remunerative
occupation despite his desire to do so”. Naba (1968) has explained
unemployment as a “condition of involuntary idleness”. The Planning
Commission of India has described a person as ‘marginally unemployed’
when he remains without work for six months in a year. Against this, the
ILO considers that person as ‘employed’ who remains with work for 15 hours
(two days) in a week (of five days). This definition may be accepted in a
developed country which provides social security to the unemployed but it
cannot be accepted in a developing country like India which has no
Unemployment Insurance Scheme. </p>
<p>
     Unemployment has three elements: (i) an individual should be capable
of working, (ii) an individual should be willing to work, and (iii) an individual
must make an effort to find work. On this basis, a person who is physically
and/ or mentally disabled, or who is chronically ill and unable to work, or a
sadhu who because of his status as an incharge of a math, considers it below
dignity to work, or a beggar who does not want to work, cannot be included
in the definition of unemployed persons. A society is believed to be in a
“condition of full employment” if the period of enforced idleness remains
minimum. A society with full employment has four characteristics: (i) an
individual takes very little time to find remunerative work according to his
capabilities and qualifications, (ii) he is sure of finding remunerative work, (iii)
the number of vacant jobs in the society exceeds the number of job seekers,
and (iv) work is available on ‘adequate remuneration’. </p>

<h1> Magnitude </h1>
<p>
Indian labour market is characterized by part-time workers, seasonality of
work, underemployment and social factors which restrict many women from
joining the labour force. Though it is often repeated that there has been an
alarming rise in unemployment in our country since independence, the exact
number of unemployed persons is not yet known. In India, the National
Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) conducts surveys on
employment/ unemployment scenario in the country. The figures given are
based only on estimates. The estimates only take into consideration the
number of persons registered in the employment exchanges and these
employment exchanges cover mainly the urban areas. Registration with the
employment exchanges being voluntary, not all the unemployed register their
names in the exchanges. Further, some of the registered persons are already </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00089">89</pagenum>
<h1> page no:89 </h1>
<p>
employed but register again to seek better employment. However, most of
the social scientists are of the opinion that quite a large proportion of the
working population is not regularly employed in our country and that these
unemployed and underemployed people and their families are dependent
upon their family members or kin even for their bare necessities. </p>
<p>
    While the number of unemployed persons in the country registered in
the employment exchanges in 1952 was 4.37 lakh, in 1967 it increased to 27.40
lakh, in 1971 to 50.99 lakh, in 1976 to 93.26 lakh (Surya, January 1979: 50—51),
in 1981 to 178 lakh, in 1983 to 220 lakh, in 1985 to 263 lakh, in 1987 to 301
lakh, in 1990 to 334 lakh (India Today, May 31,1991: 117), in 1993 to 362 lakh
and in 1995 to 381 lakh (The Hindustan Times, March 19, 1997). As per the
latest information available, given by the Ministry of Labour & Employment,
Government of India, educated and uneducated job seekers, residing in rural
and urban areas both, registered with employment exchanges in the country,
as on 3lst December, 2009, were 381.52 lakh. </p>
<p>
    According to the findings of the 68th round survey by the National
Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which is the latest one in the series, the rate in
India has increased during July 2011 to June 2012. It is 2 per cent in rural areas
and 3 per cent in urban India. The unemployment rate per 1,000 population is
at 27, while it was 25 two years ago. As on January 1, 2010, the number of
unemployed was 9. 8 million. By January 1, 2012, it has increased to 10.8
million. In rural areas, the unemployment rate for both males and females is
almost at the same level, i.e., 2 per cent. But, in, urban areas, women are more
unemployed than men. The rate is 5 per cent for women and 2 per cent for
men (Times of India, June 23, 2013).</p>
<p>
    Overall, the unemployment rates in all categories fell in the last decade.
In the case of rural females, it declined more rapidly after 2004-05 because
fewer and fewer rural females were seeking work. For urban males, the
unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in 2009-10 compared to 7.5 per cent in
2004-05, and dropped further to 4.9 per cent in 2011—12. The labour force
participation of urban males fell marginally in 2009-10 and then rose in
2011-12. This is significant because when participation rates rise,
unemployment could also rise as more people are seeking work. But, in this
unemployment fell. In the case of rural males, the unemployment rate
rose in 2004-05 but has been declining since, and was 5.5 per cent in 2011— 12.
The unemployment rate for females in urban areas has been higher compared
to all other categories since 1999—2000. In 2011-12, after a marginal increase in
the proportion of urban women seeking work and a marginal rise in the
number of urban female workers, the unemployment rate went down
marginally, which means that many found jobs (EPW, October 19, 2013).</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00090">90</pagenum>

<p>
     Similarly, state-wise, Kerala has the highest unemployment rate of close
to 10 per cent among the larger states, followed by West Bengal (4.5%) and
Assam (4.3%). Among smaller states, Nagaland has a staggering
unemployment rate of 27 per cent, followed by Tripura (15%). </p>
<p>
     The rise in unemployment rate has come despite 13.9 million new job
creation between 2010 and 2012, as the country’s workforce increased to 472.9
million from 459 million, according to data collated by the Ministry of
Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India. </p>

<h1> Types </h1>
<p>
Unemployment may be classified either as rural and urban, or as seasonal,
cyclical, and technological. Urban unemployment has been sub-classified as
educational and industrial. </p>
<p>
     Seasonal unemployment is inherent in the agricultural sector and certain
manufacturing units like sugar and ice factories. The nature of work in a sugar
factory or an ice factory is such that the workers have to remain out of work
for about six months in a year.</p>
<p>
     Agricultural unemployment is caused on account of a number of factors.
First, the landholdings are so small that even the family members of the
working age groups are not absorbed by the land. Second, the nature of work
is seasonal. Broadly speaking, a cultivator in India remains unemployed for
about four to six months in a year. Keatings in Rural Economy of Bombay
Deccan describes that a cultivator in Maharashtra works for 180 to 190 days in
a year. Calvert is of the opinion that in Punjab, a cultivator does not work for
more than 150 days in a year. R.K. Mukherjee in Rural Economy of India has
said that an average cultivator in north India does not remain busy for more
than 200 days in a year. Slater in Some South Indian Villages maintains that in
southern India, cultivators remain busy only for five and half months in a
year. Jack in Economic Life of a Bengal District explains that a jute worker
remains unemployed for nine months and a rice manufacturer for seven and a
half months in a year. All these are examples of seasonal unemployment
which is caused because of the nature of work involved. The economists have
estimated that of the total population in the rural areas, 29.4 per cent people
are self-supporting, 59 per cent are non—earning dependents, and 11.6 per cent
are earning dependents. This means that 29.4 per cent people not only support
themselves but they also support the remaining 70.6 per cent people as well. </p>
<p>
     Cyclical unemployment is caused because of the ups and downs in trade
and business. When the entrepreneurs earn high profits, they invest them in
business which increases employment, but when they get less profits or suffer
from losses or their products remain unsold and pile up, they reduce the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00091">91</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:91 </h1>
<p>
number of workers in their industries which causes unemployment. A boom
is generated when investments exceed savings, and similarly a depression
results when savings exceed investment. This is probably an over simplifi-
cation of the concept of cyclical unemployment but still it is essentially true. </p>
<p>
     Industrial unemployment is caused because of a large-scale migration of
people from rural to urban areas, losses incurred by industries, slow growth of
industries, competition with foreign industries, unplanned industrialization,
defective industrial policies, labour strikes or employers’ lockouts, rational-
ization, and so on. </p>
<p>
     Technological unemployment is caused due to the introduction of
automation or other technological changes in industry or other work places.
It is also caused due to the reduction in man power necessary to produce a
finished product. Throughout the course of economic development, particu-
larly since the industrial revolution, man has been forced to adjust himself to
the processes of mechanization. An increase in mechanical skills has both its
advantages as well as its disadvantages. Machine production has multiplied the
number of commodities consumed by an average man. This has meant a
constantly rising standard of material comfort and a concomitant increase in
the consumption of luxury goods. Certain items which were at one time
considered as luxury items for one class of people have today become items of
necessity for them. On the other hand, the industry has diminished an average
man’s economic security since every advance in technology has meant a
displacement of human labour. In fact, some new inventions do more than
merely displace labour. They create poverty which results from the
destruction of old investments and, therefore, restricts the market for new
productions. A vicious circle is thus created. In the long run, it is true that
technological improvements may increase employment in related service
industries (Elliott and Merrill, 1950: 607-8). Nevertheless, continued improve—
ments in mechanical devices mean that employment opportunities have to
increase proportionately or there will be an added residue of unemployment. </p>
<p>
     Educational unemployment is caused because the system of education is
largely unrelated to life. In fact, one of the University Grants Commission’s
(UGC) annual reports stated clearly that the present system of education is
generating much waste and stagnation. The (education) system is irrelevant
because of the stress it lays on higher education which can be given only to a
small minority, most of whom would in any case be unemployed or
unemployable once they graduate. The education is of little relevance to the
needs of the nation. The Kothari Commission (1964-66) also admitted that
there was a wide gulf between the contents of the present education and
purposes and the concerns of national development. According to a study </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00092">92</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:92 </h1>
<p>
made by the UGC in 1977, a majority of the courses taught in the universities
had not been revised for the last 30 years and were obsolete. This is true in
many cases even today. Scores of expert committees—in fact more than 50
panels appointed after independence—have delved deep into the problems of
education and churned out tonnes of pompous reports and memoranda, but
nothing seems to have really changed. </p>
<p>
     One main obstacle to a radical reform of the curriculum in higher
education are the university teachers. Such changes would require teachers to
constantly update their knowledge and keep abreast of the latest develop-
ments in their respective fields. A good number of teachers remain indifferent
to studies or are so bogged down in tuitions, part-time business and
university/ college politics that education has become a business rather than a
profession for them.  </p>
<p>
      According to Majumder and Mukherjee (2013), if we consider youth
with at least high school level of education as educated, a bleak picture emerges
as unemployment is much more pronounced among these groups. While the
average unemployment rate among youth is 6.8 per cent, among school
pass-outs it is 12.1 per cent. More than 11 per cent of Indian graduates and
postgraduates are jobless. Close to two—third of school pass-outs are
self-employed while close to half of graduates and postgraduates are casual
labourers. In terms of relative size too, educated persons are formidable
among the unemployed. While less than half of our working people are
school pass-outs, close to two-third of all unemployed youth have secondary
or higher level of education. Thus, the employment situation of educated
youth in India is much worse than the others.  </p>
<p>
     The situation is poorer for youth with certain level of technical training.
Though such technical training/ qualifications are quite sought after in the
country and are supposed to provide market ready applied skills to the candi-
dates, unemployment among technical degree holders is close to 13 per cent
while that among diploma holders is about 26 per cent. As a result, contrary
to expectations, more than one-fourth of youth with technical training are
without any gainful employment. </p>
<p>
     We can also classify youth according to their skill level - a combination of
their general, vocational and technical education. We may consider youth with
at least secondary level of general education and some vocational/ technical
training as moderately skilled and those with at least graduate level of education
and some vocational/ technical training as highly skilled. We observe that
unemployment among moderately skilled youth is 27 per cent while that
among highly skilled youth is about 20 per cent. On an aggregate about
one-fourth of skilled youth are without jobs. Incidence of skilled  </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00093">93</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:93 </h1>
<p>
unemployment is higher among females compared to males and in rural areas
relative to urban areas. As against this, unemployment among unskilled youth -
those with less than 10 years of schooling or without any vocational/ technical
training is just about 6 per cent. It is thus evident that unemployment among
educated youth is a serious problem in India. This has a regional setting too
with states like Kerala, Odisha, Jharkhand, Assam, Bengal and Jammu &
Kashmir consistently having higher levels of educated youth unemployment
compared to national average. On the other hand, unemployment among
educated youth is relatively less than national average in the states of Gujarat,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. </p>
<p>
    Unemployment among the educated youth, on the other hand, poses
another set of problems. It makes the youth so angry and frustrated that they
become militants, rebels and a threat to the unity of the country. The
widespread and gruesome agitation that followed the announcement of the
acceptance of the Mandal Commission recommendations in
August-September 1990 provides good testimony to the deep emotions that
the question of employment stirs among the youth. </p>
<h1> Causes </h1>
<p>
Economists have explained unemployment in terms of lack of capital, lack of
investment and high production. Some believe that unemployment has its
roots in the decline in the business cycle following a period of industrial
prosperity. A few hold that dislocations in the industries and an inability to
forecast the market have put a sizeable proportion of men out of work. Yet
others are of the opinion that sudden economic deflation and impersonal
forces of economic competition cause loss of work. Improvements in machine
technology, over-production, falsely stimulated speculation, social emphasis
upon monetary success and the inevitable depressions—all these make for
crippling disruption in the demand of labour. </p>
<p>
The classical school of thought places the essential cause of
unemployment on the ‘Wage Fund Theory', according to which the wages of
the workers are fixed in advance but because of lack of capital, the manufac-
turers engage only a small number of workers which results in
unemployment. They say that the remedy for unemployment lies in lowering
the wage rate. But how much down the wages could be brought? Could the
labour be denied the minimum living standard to which it had got accus-
tomed, and which in fact was its due?  If that were done, how much suffering
and misery would it cause? This led the Cambridge professor John Maynard
Keynes to enunciate a theory in 1936 (in his book General Theory of
Employment, Money and Interest) which stated that national output, effective
demand and employment were interrelated and that total volume of </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00094">94</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:94 </h1>
<p>
employment in an economy at any point of time, depended upon the level of
effective demand which meant total volume of the country’s output of goods
and services. If national output is rising constantly, employment would be
doing so ipso facto. However, at times there could be some distortions in this
framework. If savings exceeded investments, effective demand for goods and
services would decline and with that would decline the demand for labour.
This would result in some amount of unemployment. However, this could be
remedied, so goes the Keyne’s theory, by the state intervening and stimulating
investments through proper fiscal measures and raising consumption level by
injecting into the market new purchasing power, by producing deficit
budgets. After this, as after Second World War full employment came to be
accepted as the goal of the monetary policies to be pursued by governments,
budget deficits came to be looked upon as not only legitimate but also the
most desirable instrument for ‘social engineering’. However, this was nothing
but the distortion of Keynesian theory, which made inflation a perennial
feature of economic scene both in developed and developing economies. </p>
<p>
     The new classical school believes unemployment to be the result of
overproduction. Overproduction reduces the prices of the commodities
which necessitates reducing the workers, which in turn increases
unemployment. </p>
<p>
     Some economists have referred to the imbalance between demand and
supply as the cause of unemployment. When effective demand declines for the
products of industry, prices drop, factories close down, wages stop, and men
are shifted from the employed to the unemployed status through no fault of
their own. Less demand is the result of slow rate of development in early
years, or postponing investments due to poor trade and commerce, and/ or
shift (or investment) from the industrial to the non-industrial sector. </p>
<p>
     Lionel Edie (1926: 422) is of the opinion that unemployment is caused
by the disruption of the economic structure. Elliott and Merrill (1950: 606)
have said that unemployment is primarily a result of the decline in the
business cycle following a period of industrial prosperity. Advances in
technical skills and highly specialized division of labour also make it impos-
sible for able-bodied and capable men to secure jobs. Bartlett (1949: 6—9) has
said that the virtually monopolistic industries, like iron and steel industry,
have been major factors in producing depressions. These industries, he
charges, do not lower their prices sufficiently during the period of declining
price levels in other industries to make it possible to keep up their production. </p>

<h1> Social Factors </h1>
<p>
Several scholars have now maintained that unemployment cannot be ascribed
only to economic factors. Social and personal factors equally contribute to </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00095">95</pagenum>
<h1> page no:95 </h1>
<p>
unemployment. In sociological terms, unemployment can be described as the
product of a combination of social factors like degrading social status,
geographical immobility, rapid growth of population, and defective educa-
tional system; and personal factors like lack of experience, vocational
unfitness, and illness and disability.  </p>
<p>
      Degrading social or work status causes unemployment in the sense that
some people consider it below their dignity to take up certain jobs and prefer
to remain unemployed. For example, the youth consider the IAS, IPS and
teaching in the university to be prestigious jobs and teaching in schools, sales-
manship and typing to be jobs of low status and low profile. They prefer to
remain unemployed rather than accept the latter. Many students though
uninterested in doing research and working for a PhD degree prefer to accept
scholarships of Rs 5 to 10 thousand per month for two or three years rather
than accepting a clerical or a typist’s job only because it gives them social
acceptance and the status of a ‘research scholar’. They befool their friends and
relatives by claiming that they are “preparing for the competitive examina-
tions” knowing fully well that they neither have the necessary potential nor
the interest and aptitude to such examinations. Sometimes young persons
refuse to accept certain jobs because they consider their family’s position too
high for them to accept the job they have been offered. It is good to have high
aspirations and a growing desire for a high standard of living but it is unwise
to refuse to accept substitute interests and preferences. </p>
<p>
     The upsurge in the birth rate or the rapid growth of population is a
factor which immensely affects the availability of work. Gunnar Myrdal
1940), the eminent Swedish sociologist and an authority on population,
cosidered the problem of population from the standpoint of the welfare of
democratic nations and said: “To my mind, no other factor—not even that of
peace or war—is so tremendously fatal for the long time destinies of democ-
racies as the factor of population. Democracy, not only as a political form but
with all its content of civic ideals and human life, must either solve this
problem or perish”. The greater the number of unemployed children in the
family, the greater is the dependency to be borne by the parents; the greater
the number of unemployed persons in the society, the greater is the responsi-
bility to be assumed by the government. For a number of reasons, the pattern
of responsibility to be borne by the joint family system has been changing.
Maintaining unemployed dependents by nuclear families is not economically
feasible for most families. This detachment not only weakens the family ties
but also creates  many problems for the society. The increasing
unemployment due to the unchecked growth of population, thus, not only  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00096">96</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:96 </h1>
<p>
increases the responsibilities of the society but also leads to degradation as well
as loss of social esteem for the unemployed individual. </p>
<p>
     Unemployment is triggered off by geographical immobility too. There is
surplus labour in one place and inadequate labour in another place, when
people refuse to move from one region to other. The immobility may also be
due to the lack of information regarding the availability of jobs in other cities
or because of the language problem or family responsibilities. </p>
<p>
     Last, unemployment is also a result of the defective educational system.
The educational system introduced more than 160 years ago by the British to
train babus for their burgeoning bureaucracy, can no longer be described as
‘purposeful’ today. The education system is inadequate because it does not
give due priority to primary education and what it imparts at the higher
levels, at a great cost to the exchequer, does not instill attitudes needed for
nation building. The education industry is truly gigantic. Its annual budget
approximately 5 per cent of the total budget. The benefit of education is
confined to a minority comprising middle and high income groups and has
not been able to help young persons find employment. Ironically perhaps, it
even makes them unemployable by turning their minds into a duffel-bag
crammed with textbook theories which are out of date and inappropriate for
India’s development. </p>
<p>
     As regards the personal factors, lack of experience of a person (seeking a
job) because of his young age, old age affecting one’s capacity to work, lack of
vocational training, physical disabilities and illness—all go against the
unemployed and the unemployable. </p>

<h1> Consequences </h1>
<p>
Unemployment affects an individual, family and society, or it may be said
that unemployment causes personal disorganization, family disorganization
and social disorganization. </p>
<p>
     From the point of view of personal disorganization, the unemployed
person faces disillusionment and falls easy prey to cynicism. Having no outlet
to release their depression, young persons tune their creative energies into
wrong channels which explains the rise of the number of youthful bandits,
highway robberies and bank hold-ups. These anti-social activities offer a
chance to the undisciplined and recalcitrant youth to extract a living. Most of
the criminals are undoubtedly recruited from boys with a history of earlier
delinquencies but there has been an increase in the number of daring criminals
with the decrease in work opportunities. On the other hand, the plight of an
earning person who loses his job is equally sad. Ex—wage—earners are more
liable to physical illness, tension, suicide and crime, because lack of working </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00097">97</pagenum>
<h1> page no:97 </h1>
<p>
opportunities makes it impossible for them to support their dependents.
Their own dependency on others is very often morally sapping because of the
humiliation that follows. Some people in this state are even known to turn to
unlawful activities like smuggling and drug trafficking rather than squarely
facing up the actual situation. During economic depressions, the reduction in
wages and the increase in part-time jobs is further frustrating. Wages are often
unbelievably low because of the competition for jobs, and the increase in
unemployment further reduces the chance of finding a job and depreciates the
wages. The underemployed and underpaid are subjected to nearly as many
difficult adjustments as those who are completely out of work (Bakke, 1940). </p>
<p>
      Family disorganization because of unemployment is easy to measure.
Unemployment affects the unity of interests of family members, the unity of
objectives, as well as the unity of personal ambitions. The disharmonious
functioning of the members creates discord within family, which means that
not only do the tensions between the unemployed husband and wife increase
but conflicts between parents and children also arise. Sometimes the wife of an
unemployed person wants to take up a job but the idea of a wife taking up a
job irritates the husband with traditional and conservative values so much so
that there is tremendous conflict within the home. Many husbands object to
any substantial assumption of authority by their wives in the fields which
they (the husbands) consider traditionally their own. On the other hand, the
conflict between husband and wife may arise when the unemployed husband
wants his wife to take up a job and the wife is reluctant to do so because of the
presence of small children at home. </p>
<p>
      Social disorganization caused by unemployment is hard to measure.
Social disorganization is a breakdown of the social structure, or change
because of which old forms of social control no longer function effectively, or
a process by which social relationships between members of a group are
broken or dissolved. The activities of the unemployed are so restricted and
their attitudes so bitter that in this phase of disillusionment and discour-
agement, they lose their desire to work and their skills may deteriorate
with a resultant loss to the whole community (Colcord, 1941). In a brave
effort to manage the family with a little saving and/ or borrowing in cash
or kind, many families suffer slow starvation by resorting to unbelievable
economy in food and other necessities of life. </p>

<h1> Measures Taken to Contain Unemployment in India </h1>
<p>
The first measure adopted to contain unemployment was the introduction of
Prime Minister’s cash programme in 1972-73 (during the Fourth Five-Year
Plan). The introduction of various wage employment programmes in the </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00098">98</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:98 </h1>
<p>
1970s and the 1980s like Kam Ke Badle Anaj programme in 1977—78, IRDP in
1978—79, NREP in 1980—81, RLEGP in 1983 and JRY in April 1989 were very
significant to tackle the growing rural unemployment. The Narasimha Rao
government’s Prime Minister Rozgar Yojna was started in 1993-94.  </p>
<p>
      Our policy planners brought employment generation into focus in the
Eighth Five-Year Plan with other parameters so set as to achieve a 3 per cent
growth a year in employment. The overall magnitude of employment to be
generated in the Seventh Plan (1985—90) was estimated at 48.58 million which
included the backlog of 9.2 million at the out set of the plan. The plan
envisaged that there would be 3.99 per cent growth in the overall employment
in the five-year period. In particular, the plan envisaged that the special
employment programmes of the NREP, RLEGP and JRY would generate
2.26 million man—days of employment in 1989—90. Similarly, the IRDP was
envisaged to generate work of 3 million mandays, concentrating mainly on
agriculture. However, JRY could create only 7821.02 lakh mandays
employment in 1992—93, 10258.40 lakh in 1993—94, 9517.09 lakh in 1994—95
and 3616.86 lakh in 1995—96. The Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojna could create
only 0.45 lakh mandays employment in 1993-94, 125 lakh in 1994—95 and 145
lakh in 1995—96 (Rajasthan Patrika, June 16, 1996). </p>
<p>
      In 1999, to commemorate the fifty years of the country’s independence,
the Government of India launched the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar
Yojana, incorporating the already existing six schemes, viz., IRDP TRYSEM,
DWCRA, SITRA, GKY and MWS. Then, in 2001, the Sampoorna Grameen
Rozgar Yojana was introduced by merging EAS and JGSY with the objective
of providing additional wage employment and food security, alongside
creation of durables assets in rural areas. </p>
<p>
      An important scheme, launched by the Government of India to contain
unemployment, especially in rural areas, in the history of independent India,
is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(MNREGS), which aims at enhancing the livelihood security of people living
in rural areas by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment in a financial
year. It was implemented all over the country in 2006 and is more compre-
hensive in nature. </p>
<p>
      Evaluating the measures adopted to contain unemployment in the
country, it can be stated that unemployment has been a major election plank
of the parties which have been in power but a satisfactory solution still eludes
the policy planners. The important reason is that in most cases employment
generation schemes are not backed up with adequate resources. </p>
<p>
      After independence, it came to be believed by the policy planners that
unemployment can be reduced only through state intervention. This view </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page00099">99</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:99 </h1>
<p>
lasted till 1991 when the government made a u-turn in its economic policy and
planning strategy. The new measures for generating employment aimed at (i)
liberalization, (ii) doing away with controls and regulations, (iii) mobilizing
resources in the private sector, and (iv) encouraging competitiveness in the
monopolistic spheres. The economic reforms were not confined to the indus—
trial sector also. The sustained growth in the agricultural sector was also not
neglected. The Eighth Plan had paid special attention to employment in the
rural areas. And, in recent times, the MNREGS with great pomp and show.
But have these measures really succeeded?  </p>
<p>
     But, if we assess the employment growth during the last two decades, we
will find that most the above mentioned employment generation schemes
have not been successful in achieving their objectives. Even, the recently
released NSSO (68th round) data on unemployment shows that
unemployment continues to be rising in the country—the number of
unemployed increased from 9.8 million to 10. 8 million within a period of two
years from 2010 to 2012.  </p>

<h1> Rural Unemployment </h1>
<p>
Take the question of rural unemployment. For a number of years now, the
government has announced a number of employment guarantee programmes,
perceiving them as poverty alleviation strategies. There was the Food for
Work Programme, renamed the National Rural Employment Programme
(NREP). Then came the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme
(RLEGP) both of which were subsequently merged into the Jawahar Rozgar
Yojana (JRY). To this, the government added the Employment Guarantee
SCheme in March 1990, but the scheme never took off despite periodic
announcements about adopting the Maharashtra model, said to be
functioning well. And, as stated earlier. the UPA government launched its
flagship scheme—MNREGS—in 2005 to eradicate both the poverty and
unemployment from the rural areas.  </p>
<p>
       Why have these schemes failed? Let us take up the RLEGP launched in
1983 and fully funded by the central government. The basic objective of this
programme was to improve and expand employment opportunities in the
rural areas for the landless labour, guaranteeing employment to at least one
member of a rural landless household upto 100 days in a year. From 1989, the
programme stood merged with the JRY. The Comptroller and Auditor
General of India (CAG) found in the test audit that against the assessed annual
requirement (Rs 3,750 crore) for providing employment guarantee to the
extent envisaged, the annual availability of funds was only 5 per cent during
the years 1983 to 1989. The release of the total amount in 1988-89 would have   </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000100">100</pagenum>
<h1> page no:100 </h1>
<p>
been adequate to provide employment for only 22 days. Worse still, it now
turns out that the total release of funds in seven years (from 1983 to 1989) was
short of even the requirement of one year and even from this the utilization
was only 74 per cent. So, not only were the necessary funds not released but
whatever little was made available was not fully utilized. </p>
<p>
       The report has some illuminating details. From the available funds, a
good amount (Rs 26.50 crore) got diverted to other schemes and spent on-of
all things—cars, jeeps, air-conditioners, video cameras and for investment in
term deposits and the National Savings Schemes. Foodgrains meant for distri-
bution under the RLEGP found their way to the public distribution agencies
and other organizations. But, surprisingly, despite all these shortcomings, the
programme generated 10 per cent more mandays than the official target
during 1983—89. The CAG, however, does not accept these figures as
authentic and reliable. It found the method of calculating mandays wrong.
Instead of compiling the generated man-days on the basis of actual muster
rolls, many states (like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya
Pradesh, Punjab, Nagaland and West Bengal) were compiling employment
generation figures on a notional basis by dividing the wage component of the
outlay by the prescribed minimum daily wage rate. In one district of
Maharashtra, it was found that the figures of mandays created were being
worked out by dividing the actual expenditure (including the non-wage
component also) by the minimum wage rate, thus inflating the figures. </p>
<p>
     Not only this, the MNREGS is also being constantly charged with
misuse of funds and corruption. Employment under the scheme has declined
to 39 mandays only in 2012-13. The highest decline happened in the poorest
states. Similarly, budget outlays at the central level have been cut by Rs 7,000
crore in 2013—14. As a result, expenditure on MNREGS has gone down from
nearly 1 per cent of the GDP in 2008—09 to only 0.3 per cent in 2012—13. </p>
<p>
     If this is illustrative of the rural employment schemes, little wonder that
in about six decades after independence, the country still carries the burden of
about one-fourth of the population under the poverty line. </p>
<p>
     What is our agricultural policy and what are our goals? Is our goal to
accelerate the growth rate of agricultural output, or achieve national food
self-sufficiency, or keep enriching the large farmers with periodic hikes in
procurement and support prices, or make work available to all cultivators in
the villages? So far, our emphasis had been to give highest priority to
production of foodgrains. But, in the last two decades, there has been a decline
in the cultivated area under foodgrains. The gross crop area of foodgrains
came down in the negative from 8.4 per cent in 2003-04 to (—) 2.7 per cent in
2004—05 (India 2008). However, there has been significant rise in cultivated </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000101">101</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:101 </h1>
<p>
area under commercial crops like oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane, etc. This has
resulted in decline in total foodgrain production. The shortage in the domestic
market is made good by importing wheat, which of course is at much higher
price than that allotted to the Indian traders. This points out the basic
question that we should find alternative sources of work for the rural people
which will solve the twin problems of rural poverty and unemployment.
Unless the reforms and programmes of structural adjustments and infrastruc-
tural development in rural areas are not launched, the targeted economic and
social objectives may not be achieved. Can freeing agriculture from the
shackles of government controls and subsidies be a solution? Will such a step
enable agricultural sector to offer much greater volume of employment than
is the case at present? Or will this step affect the small and marginal farmers,
the food prices, and the food-deficit states? The question is indeed debatable. </p>
<p>
      For educated unemployed, the Government of India has also launched a
self-employment scheme, called Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY), in
1993 to provide loans through banks for self-employment. The central
government provides capital subsidy for this purpose and routes it through
the Reserve Bank of India. From 1994—95 the existing Self-Employment
Scheme for the Educated Unemployed Youth (SEEUY) was subsumed in
PMRY. But, like the other rural employment schemes, the PMRY has not
done much. The number of educated persons getting loans is decreasing
continuously, and so is the subsidy released by the central government. There
is also a gradual decline in the achievement of yearly targets set for the scheme.
For example, while in 2000—01,7O per cent of the target youth were
sanctioned loans, in 2002—03 this percentage came down at 52. Thus, if the
scheme flops, as the trend shows, the employment calculations are bound to
go hay wire. Besides the law and order machinery, the political system would
also come under greater strain in the years to come because of the rising
unemployment. </p>
<p>
      The Janata Dal promised a new carrot of ‘Right to Work’ in its election
manifesto in 1990. This meant that the government was to so shape its
economic policies as to create productive, useful jobs for all those who wanted
them and to ensure that all those who wanted to work were provided the
opportunity to do so. But before it could take up this challenge, the
government had to quit in November 1990. The Congress government, led
by P.V. Narasimha Rao, which remained in power for five years (from 1991
to May 1996), totally failed in providing jobs or alleviating poverty. Various
scams during this period only point to the functioning of the ruling elite in
this period. The United Front government of H.D. Deve Gowda, which
came into power in June 1996, claimed to have a programme of reducing rural </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000102">102</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:102 </h1>
<p>
unemployment and poverty but it could not do anything as it had to resign in
April 1997. Even, the BJP- led NDA government, under the prime minis-
tership of Atal Behari Vajpayee, could not do much to improve the
unemployment scenario in the country during its tenure, which lasted from
1998 to 2004. </p>
<p>
     The question is: In the present situation of our country, is the guarantee
of the right to work feasible? With cold hard statistics, can a concrete
blueprint of an employment generation programme be worked out? The
feeling is that the slogan of ‘right to work’ is nothing but a digressive, escapist,
tangential, flippant, and a comic proposal. Mere making of a promise or a
provision in the constitution is not likely to provide work for anyone, except
perhaps for the politicians who are experts in making impossible promises.
They find nothing wrong in adding one more promise of ‘right to work'
without giving substantial thought to comprehensive economic policies,
innovative employment generation schemes, efficient organization of the
economic system, and other pragmatic and result-oriented techniques. The
‘right to work’ is neither viable nor enforceable without massive inputs. It is a
distant fantasy and an empty Shibboleth. Where are the resources and billions
and trillions of rupees to give jobs to about 4 crore unemployed persons,
considering the large amount of money that is needed per year to create even
one job? Will this slogan not lead to wholesale frustration and disillusionment
all around? Is not ‘right to work’ linked with obtaining a mandate from a
court of law to get a job and the right of employer to terminate the
employee’s services, collective bargaining, and so forth? Is it not contradictory
to the right of reservation ? Do we, therefore, not find a pathological fallacy in
the thinking of politicians who give such populist slogans and promises? </p>

<h1> Will Unemployment Insurance be a Right Policy? </h1>
<p>
The ideal state today is considered to be one which is a welfare state, i.e., one
which accepts the responsibility of freeing its citizens from want and fear.
Arrangement of universal education, provision of health care, security against
unemployment, protection against physical disabilities, and providing secure
wages, ample leisure time and a generous pension are regarded as essential
functions of the state. No doubt, all this is a noble endeavour. People in many
countries see it as their due and as a work of civility of their society. But can
the economic and fiscal cost of the welfare programme be ignored in this
ideal? If unemployment insurance scheme is introduced in India, can this be
funded in a sustainable way? With the increasing unemployment and
increased cost of living, how can our government fulfil the rising expectations
of the people? Further, it has also come to be realized in many developing </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000103">103</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:103 </h1>
<p>
countries having social security schemes that social security system is a
contributory cause of the present day high rate of unemployment. Take, for
example, the case of unemployment insurance. In most countries in Europe
and America, unemployment benefits run for two years or longer at upto 80
per cent of a person’s previous earnings. In Belgium and Denmark, there is no
limit to their duration. So, what is the point of looking for work, to say
nothing of taking a low-paid job. </p>

<h1>  Remedies </h1>
<p>
What are the job avenues open today to the new entrants in the employment
market? The XXXI Indian Labour Conference (ILC) held in 1994 in Delhi
suggested following measures for the galloping jobless conundrum in the
country: (a) encouraging self-employment, (b) drastic reorganization of
vocational courses, and (c) identification of skills needed in the present-day
context required by industrial units, and designing courses and curricula
relevant to such identified skills in demand in the employment market. </p>
<p>
      The innumerable opportunities for self— employment can be found not
only in urban areas but in rural areas too. In rural areas, these include: farming
on modern scientific lines, small- scale industries, agro—industries, forest-based
industries, dairy farming, poultry farming, village arts and crafts (like
handmade paper, pottery, leather goods, hand- printing and dyeing of textiles,
carpets, rugs, etc.,) small business and trade, nurseries, and hire and repair of
farming equipment. </p>
<p>
      One measure, already suggested, is regulating higher education. The
growth in the number of graduates and technical personnel continues at the
rate of roughly 10 per cent a year. A single job requires roughly Rs 3 lakh per
year. At this rate and assuming unemployed in the country, the government
has to dole out Rs 12,00,000 crore. Do we have this astronomical figure to
spare for the unemployed alone? Why does not the government, therefore,
control higher education? Perhaps, the crux of the matter is that not only the
government but the politicians, teachers, students, public—all have a vested
interest. The teachers like their sinecures. Administrators want a situation in
which the spectre of unemployment can temporarily be kept at bay. The rich
elite want to hog the largest piece of the cake at the expense of the poor. The
politicians prefer large universities spawning hordes of idle and frustrated and
ill-educated students, for they are the ones who steel their political muscles. </p>
<p>
       Another reason why jobs are not growing fast enough is the labour laws.
In India, it is virtually impossible to retrench labour; hence businessmen often
prefer contract labour to permanent staff. Not surprisingly, the number
employed by the private organized sector has remained more or less constant </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000104">104</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:104 </h1>
<p>
over the last decade at around 8.5 million. Only public sector jobs have been
on the rise, but even here the rate of growth has slowed down from over 194
lakh in 1999 to just over 185 lakh in 2003. The anti-employment ethos created
by rigid laws therefore needs to be tackled by the government. </p>
<p>
      Some people suggest that economic growth is the best solution for
tackling unemployment. This may be true for some time but not for ever.
This is because of three reasons: First, economic growth has its limits. Second,
advances in technology tend to displace labour in traditional occupations and
industries. Third, these economies, over the years, develop structural rigidities
which prevent adaptation to changing situation. The economic relations
developed in decades of high growth rates cannot be sustained during the
economic stagnation periods. However, a developing country like India does
need the policy and programme of economic growth. Along with this, the
policy of free trade will also create many employment opportunities  and
reduce unemployment. Depending upon the developed countries for helping
the developing countries like India in their development programmes will be
like living in a fool’s paradise in this age because such countries are bound to
impose their ideas and ideologies on the country seeking their economic help.
India has to depend on its own resources. Of course, some aid in the form of
loans at concessional rates of interest for development projects, some capital
investments, and starting of some joint ventures in selected sectors may be
helpful in the development of our economy, and in mitigating the problem of
spreading unemployment. </p>
<p>
     It may thus be pointed out that the remedial measures for reducing
unemployment must lay greater emphasis on: (a) creation of opportunities for
self employment; (b) augmentation of productivity and income levels of the
working poor; (c) shift in emphasis from creation of relief type of
employment to the building up of durable productive assets in the rural areas;
and (d) instead of attempting to revert somewhat to protectionist policy and
emphasizing on Common Minimum Programme like the one flaunted by the
UPA-I government, liberalization of policy may be given a serious trial and
the pace of privatization may be accelerated. </p>

Population Explosion, Page no:106

</h1>
<p>
 In the midst of political uncertainty and communal fury over the past few
decades, the problem of population explosion has been relegated to the
background. Neither the social scientists nor the political parties or the
governments seem to think it necessary to focus attention upon what is surely
the most crucial single problem facing the nation. There is no dearth of studies
and views of the scholars to highlight the fact that India is falling behind in the
race for economic and human resources development mainly because it has
not shown much progress in containing its population growth. </p>

<h1> Increase in Population </h1>
<p>
India with a population of about 1,210 million (in 2011) accounts for 17.5 per
cent of the world population. It is the second largest country in the world,
next only to China with a population of about 1,341 million (in 2010). Six
countries (China with 19.4%, India with 17.5%, US with 4.5%, Indonesia with
3.4%, Brazil with 2.8% and Russia with 2%) account for nearly half (49.6%) of
the world population. In other words, the population of India, at 1,210
million, is almost equal to the combined population of USA, Indonesia,
Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Japan—the population of these six countries
totals 1,214 million.  </p>
<p>
      The scale at which India’s population is increasing is simply
mind-boggling. While the total population of our country in 1941 was 31.86
crore, it increased to 36.10 crore in 1951, 43.92 crore in 1961, 54.81 crore in
1971, 68.33 crore in 1981, 84.64 crore in 1991, 102 crore in 2001 and 121 crore
in 2011, according to the provisional data of 2011 Census. The United  </p>

<p>
Nations has estimated that the world population grew at an annual rate of
1.23 per cent during 2000-2010. China registered a much lower growth
(0.53%) during this period as compared to India, which recorded an annual
growth rate of 1.64 per cent during 2001-2011. </p>
<p>
     The population of India, at the turn of the 20th century, was only 238
million, which has increased by more than four times in a period of 110 years
to reach 1,210 million in 2011. Interestingly, the population of India grew by
one and half times in the first half of the 20th century, while in the later half it
recorded a phenomenal three-fold increase. </p>
<p>
      In absolute terms, the population of India has increased by 181 million
during 2001—2011. Although, the net addition in population during each
decade has increased consistently, the changes in net addition has shown a
steady decline over the decades beginning from 1961. While 27.9 million
more people were added between the decade 1981-1991 than between
1971—1981, this number declined to 19.2 million for the decades between
1981—1991 and 1991-2001. The provisional results of 2011 Census show that
between 2001 and 2011, the net addition is less than that of the previous
decade by 0.86 million. </p>
<p>
      It is also significant to note that the decadal growth in percentage terms
during 2001-2011 has registered the sharpest decline since
independence—from 23.87 per cent for 1981-1991 to 21.54 for 1991-2001, i.e.,
a decrease of 2.33 percentage points. For 2001—2011, this has become 17.64 per
cent- a further decrease of 3.90 percentage points. Thus, while the rate of
growth of population during the first of the 20th century was moderate, in the
later half it was faster as well as alarming though changes in net addition have
shown a steady declining trend over the years. </p>
<p>
 The disaster of galloping population in India can be recognized from the
following facts: </p>
<p>
0  At present, a little more than one out of every six persons in the
   world is from India.

0  India accounts for a meagre of 2.4 per cent of the world’s surface area
   of 135.79 million square kms, whereas it supports and sustains a
   whooping 17.5 per cent of world’s population.

0 As China is constantly showing lower growth in its population over
  the last few years, it is now estimated that by 2030, India will most
  likely overtake China to become the most populous country on the
  earth.
0 The four big states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
  Bihar account for approximately 40 per cent of country’s total
  population and still have an alarming high crude birth rate. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000108">108</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:108 </h1>
<p>
0  More than three times as many couples enter the reproductive span
than those leaving it, with the fertility rate of the younger group
being three times higher than that of those passing out of the repro-
ductive range. </p>
<p>
0  At the present rate of growth, life for most Indians would be
unbearable—medical facilities would be difficult to provide, expenses
on education, housing, etc. would be exorbitant, technical and profes-
sional education would become the exclusive prerogative of the elite,
and the scarcity of food would once again plunge more than half of
the nation below the poverty line. </p>
<p>
      Thus, there is immediate need to focus serious attention on containing
population growth in India. As India, with the second largest population in
the world, fights valiantly to overcome a historical legacy of social and
economic backwardness, a steep population growth not only negates the
little achievements but also puts tremendous pressure on our already
overloaded system. </p>

<h1> Causes of Population Growth </h1>

<p> We may identify the following important causes for population explosion: </p>

<h1> Widening Gap Between Birth and Death Rates </h1>
<p>
The average annual birth rate in India, which was 42 per thousand population
in 1951—61, came down to 24.8 per thousand in 2011. The death rate also came
down from over 27 per thousand population in 1951—61 to just 8 in 2011
(Census of India, 2011). Thus, since birth rate has shown a moderate decline
and the death rate has gone down rather sharply, the widening gap has
increased our population rapidly. The total fertility rate (average number of
children born per woman) came down from about six in the fifties to three in
2011. Yet, for the past ten years, the median household size in India has stayed
out at less than four children in cities and between four and five children in
villages. If we add the annual figures of abortions (6.20 lakh in 2010—11) to the
estimated annual number of live births (2.05 crore in 2010) that take place in
the country, we come to the shocking conclusion that in this age of family
planning, one out of every four Indian women in the reproductive age group
of 15—45 years is pregnant at any time. </p>
<h1> Low Age at Marriage </h1>
<p>
Child marriages have been very common in our country. According to the
1931 census, 72 per cent marriages in India were performed before 15 years of
age and 34 per cent before ten years of age. Since then, there has been a
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000109">109</pagenum>
<h1> page no:109 </h1>
<p>
continuous increase in the mean age of marriage among both males and females.
At present, in India, average age for men is 26 and 22.2 for women. The average
age at marriage of females increased from 17.7 in 1971 to 18.7 in 1981 to 19.3 in
1991 to 20.2 in 2001 and 22.2 in 2011. Against this, for males, the corresponding
figures are 22.7, 23.4, 24, 24.8 and 26 (medindia.net). Thus, though the age of
marriage has been continuously increasing, yet a large number of girls even
today marry at an age at which they are not ready for marriage either socially
and emotionally, or physiologically and chronologically. </p>
<p>
The infant mortality rate (IMR) is directly related to the age of women at
marriage. According to ‘Family Welfare Statistics in India—2011’ published
by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, in rural
areas, the IMR in 2009 was 55 while in the urban areas, it was 34. If we relate
fertility rates (average number of children born per woman) with age groups,
we find that as the age group increases, the fertility rate decreases. If
population growth is to be controlled, marriage of females (both in rural and
urban areas) is to be taken place in 21—23 or 23—25 age groups than in 15—18 or
18—21 age groups. </p>

<h1>  High Illiteracy </h1>
<p>
Family planning has a direct link with female education, and female education
is directly associated with age at marriage, general status of women, their
fertility and infant mortality rate and so forth. According to the provisional
report of the 2011 Census, the overall literacy percentage in India is 74.04 as
compared to 64.83 ten years ago. The male literacy percentage is 82.14 while
the female literacy percentage is 65.46. Education makes a person liberal,
broad- minded, open to new ideas, and rational. If both men and women are
educated, they will easily understand the logic of planning their family, but if
either of them or both of them are illiterate, they would be more orthodox,
illogical and religious-minded. This is evident from the fact that Kerala which
has the overall literacy rate of 92.92 per cent and female literacy rate of 91.98
per cent (in 2009) has the lowest birth rate (14. 70 per thousand) while
Rajasthan’ s appallingly low female literacy rate of 52.66 per cent (in 2009)
gives rise to the third highest birth rate in the country (27. 20%), the highest
having been registered in Uttar Pradesh (28. 70%), followed by Madhya
pradesh (27.70%). These statistical figures hold good for most of the other
states too. </p>

<h1> Religious Attitude Towards Family Planning </h1>
<p>
The religiously orthodox and conservative people are against the use of family
planning measures. There are women who disfavour family planning on the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000110">110</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:110 </h1>
<p>
plea that they cannot go against the wishes of God. There are some women
who argue that the purpose of a woman’s life is to bear children. Other
women adopt a passive attitude: “If I am destined to have many children, I will
have them. If not, I will not have them. Why should I bother about it”. </p>
<p>
     Indian Muslims have a higher birth rate as well as fertility rate than the
Hindus (Muslim women having fertility rate of 4 as compared to 3 among
Hindus women). According to surveys conducted among the Muslims from
time to time, it is found that despite awareness about modern family planning
methods, most of the respondents—both male and female—were either against
using them on religious grounds or they lacked clear and adequate knowledge
about them. </p>

<h1> Other Causes </h1>
<p>
Some of the other causes responsible for the increase in population are: joint
family system and lack of responsibility of young couples in these families to
bring up their children, lack of recreational facilities, and lack of information
or wrong information about the adverse effects of vasectomy, tubectomy, etc.</p>
<p>
     Many poor parents produce children not because they are ignorant but
because they need them. This is evident from the fact that there are some 13
million child workers in our country. If families stop those children from
working, their family income will not be supplemented. </p>
<p>
     Producing more children by the poor people illustrates the paradox of
population-poverty interrelationship. Poverty is both the cause and effect of the
population growth. Having produced many children for sons to combat one’s
family’s growing needs, the parents are forced to keep them out of school to
supplement their household income. In turn, unlettered and ignorant children
will inherit their father’s lot, and like him, opt to have as many sons as are
needed to work for sustenance. Ironically, a huge family size is the poor man’s
only way to combat poverty caused by the population boom. </p>

<h1> Effects of Population Explosion </h1>
<p>
The growth of population has a direct effect on the living standards of the
people. This is why, despite our spectacular progress in the agricultural and
industrial spheres since independence, our per capita income has not risen
appreciably. </p>
<p>
    How has the population growth affected India? It is estimated that about
2 million people are homeless, 97 million people have no access to safe
drinking water, 272 million people are illiterate, 43 per cent children below
five years are underweight, and country as a whole has 136th position in the
World Human Development Index. The appalling overcrowding of our </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000111">111</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:111 </h1>
<p>
cities (which like cancerous growths are mushrooming unchecked with slums
proliferating) has brought about a virtual breakdown of transportation,
electricity and other services. It has also led to the rise of crime and an increase
in violence in the urban and the semi-urban areas. All this has been directly
fuelled by the addition of about 16 million people every year. If the
population continues to increase at this rate, in a few years from now, we will
have an army of unemployed, hungry and desperate people who will threaten
the very foundations of the social, economic and political systems and institu-
tions of the country. All sectoral demands have a numerical dimension.
Whether it is education, employment, health, housing, water supply or any
other sector, the perennial question is for how many? Even for the present
population of 1,210 crore (in 2011), it is futile to think of jobs or shelter or
health care programmes for all, especially when another 2 crore people would
be added every year and, hence, need to be accommodated.  </p>
<p>
    It has been calculated that for every addition of about 10 crore people in
our country, we will require 1.50 lakh primary and middle schools, 10 thousand
higher secondary schools, 50 lakh primary and middle school teachers, 1.5 lakh
higher secondary school teachers, 5,000 hospitals and dispensaries, 2,000
primary health centres, two lakh hospital beds, 50 thousand doctors, 25
thousand nurses, 20 million tonnes cereals, 25,000 metres of cloth and 2,500
million houses (India Today, September 16—30, 1979: 53).  </p>
<p>
     The impact of the population boom on the quality of life is now being
examined in terms of Household Misery Index (HMI), i.e., in terms of
people’s deprivations and basic needs (see Bose, 1996). The HMI has five
parameters: pucca housing, safe drinking water, electricity, sanitation (toilets),
and fuel for cooking. Some scholars have examined it in terms of effect on
human resources (literacy, health, etc.).  </p>
<p>
   At present, over 300 million people in India have no electricity in their
households, nearly half of 1.2 billion people have no toilets (flush or others),
48.4 per cent have no pucca houses and 97 million have no safe drinking water.
In another sign that India has much catching up to do, the Human Devel-
opment Report of 2013, released by the United Nations Development
programme (UNDP), ranked the country at a low 136 among 186 countries
on its Human Development Index (HDI)—a composite measure of life expec-
tancy, access to education and income levels. The report placed India at the
near-bottom of countries which have reached ‘medium development’. With
its index standing at 0.554 for the last year, India has miles to go to meet
countries like Norway (ranked number 1) which boasts of an HDI of 0.955
(Times of India, March 15, 2013).  </p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000112">112</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:112 </h1>
<p>
    The above-mentioned figures indicate the serious effect of increasing
population on the quality of life. Besides, public expenditure on health is only
1.2 per cent of the country’s GDP, which is much lower than the 4 per cent
plus levels in countries like US, UK, Australia, Norway and Brazil. Similarly,
educational spending in India is also much lower than most of other countries
For example, in 2010, the United States spent 7.3 per cent of its GDP on
education, compared with the 6.3 per cent average of other OECD countries.
Denmark topped the list with 8 per cent, whereas India spent only 3.3 per cent. </p>
<p>
      What do these figures predict? The 21st century has already begun. Our
country has to either come to terms with the highly competitive world
economy or go bust. India will be looking for a policy framework which can
be bold enough to take up the issue of containing population explosion
seriously. Unless India can do so, its future is doomed. </p>

<h1> Population Policy </h1>
<p>
A ‘policy’ is a “plan of action, statement of aims and ideals, specially one made
by a government, a political party, a business company, etc.” It guides the
present and the future decisions. ‘Population policy’, in its narrower sense,
according to the UN (1973: 632), is “an effort to affect the size, structure and
distribution or characteristics of population”. In its broader range, it includes
“efforts to regulate economic and social conditions which are likely to have
demographic consequences”. Nortman (1975: 20) describes the narrower
meaning as ‘explicit policy’ which affects directly the population character-
istics, and the broader meaning as ‘implicit policy’ which affects the
characteristics indirectly, sometimes without any explicit intention. </p>
<p>
     Any public policy, including population policy, is a step towards the
future and an attempt to achieve desired goals. As such, it is to be laid down in
terms of goals, the past and present trends towards the achievement of these
goals, social conditions accounting for the direction and intensity of these
trends, projections for probable future, and alternatives likely to be achieved
most in reaching the desired goal(s). This means that the policy (population)
has to be associated with participants, values or goals, institutions and
resources. </p>
<p>
     Two types of population policies have been suggested: (a) the ante-natal
policy which aims at discouraging the growth of the population, and (b) the
distributional policy which deals with the distributional imbalances of the
population. The National Academy of Sciences has discerned population
policy as one (a) which influences the demographic processes according to a
pre-set objective (for example, encouraging people to move from urban to
suburban areas), and (b) which will cope with the demands created by the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000113">113</pagenum>
<h1> page no:113 </h1>
<p>
demographic processes (for example, providing basic facilities to people in
suburban areas). </p>
<p>
     The population policy of a developing country like India has to aim at (i)
decreasing birth rate, (ii) limiting the number of children in family to two, (iii)
decreasing the mortality, (iv) creating awareness among the masses regarding
the consequences of galloping population, (v) procuring necessary contracep-
tives, (vi) enacting laws like legalizing abortion, and (vii) giving incentives as
well as disincentives. On the other hand, it also has to aim at (a) checking the
concentration of people in congested areas, (b) providing necessary public
services for effective settlement in new areas, and (c) relocation of offices to
less populated areas. </p>
<p>
     Once the need for the population policy is realized, it has to be framed
by appointing various committees and commissions for studying and advising
and consulting experts. It has then to be implemented through various
programmes and also evaluated from time to time. </p>
<p>
      India’s population policy is the direct result of (a) the total size of the
population, (b) a high growth rate, and (c) the problem of uneven distribution
in rural and urban areas. Since our policy needs to aim at “enhancing the
quality of life”, and “increasing individual happiness”, it has to act as a means
to attaining a broader objective of achieving individual fulfilment and social
Progress. Initially, the policy framed in 1952 was ad-hoc in nature, flexible,
and based on a trial and error approach. Gradually, it was replaced by more
scientific planning. </p>
<p>
      The sub-committee on population appointed in 1940 under the chair-
manship of Dr Radha Kamal Mukherjee by the National Planning
Committee (appointed by Indian National Congress in 1938) laid emphasis on
self-control, spreading knowledge of cheap and safe methods of birth control
and establishing birth control clinics. It also recommended raising the
marriage age, discouragement of polygamy, and an eugenic programme of
sterilizing persons suffering from transmissible diseases. The Bhore
Committee of 1946 appointed by the government criticized self-control
approach and advocated “deliberate limitation of families". </p>
<p>
      After independence, a Population Policy Committee was created in 1952
and a Family Planning Research and Programmes Committee in 1953. A
Central Family Planning Board was created in 1956 which emphasized on
sterilizations. During the 1960s, a more vigorous family planning programme
was advocated for stabilizing the growth of population over a reasonable
period. While earlier, it was assumed by the government that the family
planning programme had created enough motivation among the people and
the government was only to provide facilities for contraception, was
realized that people needed motivation and masses had to be educated. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000114">114</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:114 </h1>
<p>
     The primary objective of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969—74) was to
reduce the annual birth rate to 32 by 1974 and family planning was given high
priority. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act was passed in
1971. The Fifth Five—Year Plan integrated family planning programme with
maternal and child health programmes. </p>
<p>
     In April 1976, the Minister of Health and Family Planning, Dr Karan
Singh, presented before the parliament the National Population Policy
framed after prolonged and intensive consultations with governmental and
non-official organizations, academic institutions, as well as eminent demogra,
phers and economists. This policy covered a wide spectrum of programmes
including raising the statutory age of marriage, introducing fiscal incentives to
states which perform well in the field of family planning, paying special
attention to improving female literacy, public education through all available
media (radio, television, press, films), introducing direct monetary incentives
for adoption of vasectomy and tubectomy operations, and a new thrust
towards research in reproductive biology and contraception. Though this
policy was endorsed by the parliament, it was planned at a time when the
Emergency was in operation. As stated earlier, there were so many excesses in
the sterilization campaign under the leadership of Sanjay Gandhi, the
President of Indian Youth Congress, that it came to be regarded with hostility
by the people. The programme was so overzealously and insensitively imple-
mented in some of the North Indian states that during the election in 1977
after the Emergency, these excesses became an important election issue and
the Congress lost the elections at the Centre. When in 1980, Indira Gandhi
returned to power, she became extremely cautious and unenthusiastic about
reviving her commitment to the family planning programmes. Since then, the
policy of almost all governments in the states and at the centre has been so
lopsided that the growth rate of population which was expected to have fallen
below the 1 per cent mark, is still around 1.64 per cent (2011).</p>
<p>
      In a nutshell, according to the National Commission on Population,
following are the milestones in the evolution of the population policy in
India: </p>
<p>
0 1946: Bhore Committee Report.
0 1952: Launching of Family Planning Programme.
0 1976: Statement of National Population Policy.
0 1977: Policy Statement on Family Welfare Programme.
  Both statements were laid in parliament, but never discussed or adopted.
0 1983: The National Health Policy of 1983 emphasized the need for
  “securing the small family norm, through voluntary efforts and
   moving towards the goal of population stabilization”. While adopting </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000115">115</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:115 </h1>
<p>
  the Health Policy, the parliament emphasized the need for a separate
National Population Policy. </p>
<p>
0 1991: The National Development Council appointed a Committee
on Population with Shri Karunakaran as Chairman. The
Karunakaran Report (Report of the National Development
Council—NDC Committee on Population) endorsed by NDC in
1993 proposed the formulation of a National Population Policy to
take a “a long-term holistic view of development, population growth
and environmental protection” and to “suggest policies and guidelines
(for) formulation of programmes” and “a monitoring mechanism
with short, medium and long term perspectives and goals”. It was
argued that the earlier policy statements of 1976 and 1977 were placed
on the table, however, parliament never really discussed or adopted
them. Specifically, it was recommended that “a National Policy of
Population should be formulated by the government and adopted by
parliament”. </p>
<p>
0 1993: An Expert Group headed by Dr M.S. Swaminathan was asked
 to prepare a draft of a national population policy that would be
 discussed by the cabinet and then by parliament. </p>
<p>
0 1994: Report on a National Population Policy by the Expert Group
headed by Dr Swaminathan. This report was circulated among
Members of Parliament, and comments requested from central and
state agencies. It was anticipated that a national population policy
approved by the NDC and the parliament would help produce a
broad political consensus. </p>
<p>
 The policy draft submitted by the Swaminathan Committee (1994)
suggested a holistic approach to health and some structural changes to
implement the policy. The important measures suggested by this
committee were: (1) Stabilizing population by achieving a total fertility
rate of 2.1 by 2010 AD. (2) Implementing a speedy and effective
minimum needs programme. (3) Replacing the present vertically struc-
tured family welfare programme with decentralized, democratic
planning through panchayats, nagar palikas and state legislatures. (4)
Involving all agencies in population control measures. (5) Abandoning
the idea of fixing targets for the use of specific contraceptive methods by
the central and state governments, except the goal of achieving the
national average of fertility rate. (6) Discontinuing incentives in cash or
kind to contraceptive users and motivators. Instead, a Population and
Social Development Fund may be set up out of the funds available from
government and international donor agencies. This fund will be utilized </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000116">116</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: 116 </h1>
<p>
for filling the gaps in the effective implementation of the village, town,
district and state level socio-demographic charters. (7) Appointing a State
Population and Social Development Commission to plan, implement
and monitor the population policy of the country. The sub-committees
of PSDC will also be set up at the state, district and panchayat levels
comprising elected representatives of people from different political
parties, professionals, representatives of NGOs and women’s and
youth’s organizations. (8) Family planning has become a responsibility
for women alone. As such there is a need for checking the trend of
putting the entire responsibility for family limitation on women.  </p>
<p>
Some socio-economic and medical goals set by the committee in the field
of population welfare for forming a necessary part of the national
population policy were: (i) reducing the incidence of marriage of girls
below the age of 18 years to zero; (ii) increasing the percentage of deliv-
eries conducted by trained personnel to 100 per cent; (iii) reducing the
infant and maternal mortality rates; (iv) universal immunization of
children against tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, whooping cough,
tetanus and measles; (v) provision for primary health care for all; (vi)
providing information to individuals on birth limitation methods so
that they have the fullest choice in planning their families; (vii) making
available and accessible the quality contraceptive services on a universal
basis; and (vii) universalization of primary education.   </p>
<p>
But, the experts have criticized the recommendations of this committee
and have suggested that they should be rejected outright. Their main
arguments are: (1) The report lacks in-depth analysis, justification and
urgency. The approach suggested is purely managerial and the strategies
pointed out are at best a reiteration of the failed aphorism that “devel-
opment is the best contraception”. (2) Minimum needs have no
relationship with population control. How could all the goals which
could not be achieved in the past over four decades in spite of eight Five
Year Plans and eleven general elections with all the political promises
could be achieved by 2010 AD and more so when our population has
already crossed the 975 crore (in 1996) mark with about 32 crore still
below the poverty line? (3) A political population commission will be
ineffective. (4) The committee has not recommended any disincentive
for those who violated family planning norms. The Karunakaran
Committee had proposed the introduction of disincentives—even if
unpopular—to make the family planning programmes more effective
and fast acting. One such programme was introduced by the
Government of Rajasthan according to which no individual can contest   </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000117">117</pagenum>

<p>
any election if he has more than three children. However, this
programme exists only on paper. It is yet to be put in practice. (5) The
report does not spell out why we failed in controlling our rapid
population growth, though the population programmes have been
going on in India uninterrupted since 1951. Is this failure because of the
drawbacks in the administrative set up or because of wrong policies or
faulty or tardy implementation? This is the fundamental issue which is
ignored by the report. Without this analysis, the structural changes as
proposed in the report may be quite irrelevant. (6) The biggest hurdle in
the success of population control in India is political apathy, but the
committee did not give any importance to this aspect. The political
leaders have to be bold in enacting such legislative measures which may
focus on the urgency of the issue. Denying promotions, debarring from
holding any elected office, not giving reservation benefits, refusing bank
loans, etc. to those who do not observe small family norm of two
children could be some disincentives through legislation. </p>
<p>
01997: On the 50th anniversary of India’s independence, the then
Prime Minister promised to announce a National Population Policy
in the near future. During November 1997, the Union Cabinet
approved the draft National Population Policy with the direction
that this be placed before parliament. However, this document could
not be placed in either house of parliament as the respective houses
stood adjourned followed by dissolution of the Lok Sabha. </p>
<p>
0 1999: Another round of consultations was held during 1998, and
another draft National Population Policy was finalized and placed
before the cabinet in March 1999. The cabinet appointed a Group of
Ministers (headed by Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission) to
examine the draft policy. The Group of Ministers met several times
and deliberated over the nuances of the population policy. In order to
finalize a view about inclusion/ exclusion of incentives and disincen-
tives, the Group of Ministers invited a cross-section of experts from
among academia, public health professionals, demographers, social
scientists, and women’s representatives. The Group of Ministers
finalized a draft population policy, and placed the same before
cabinet. This was discussed in cabinet on 19 November 1999. Several
suggestions were made during the deliberations. On that basis, a fresh
draft was submitted to cabinet. </p>
<p>
0  2000. The National Population Policy provided a policy framework
for advancing goals and prorating strategies during the next decades
to meet the reproductive and child health needs of the people of </p>

<p>
India. This policy stated that the objective of economic and social
development is to improve the quality of lives people lead to enhance
their well being and to provide them with opportunities and choices
to become productive assets in society. The immediate objective of
this new policy was to address the unmet needs of contraception,
health infrastructure, health personnel and to provide integrated
service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care. The
long-term target is to achieve a stable population by 2045. In
pursuance of these objectives, a number of socio—demographic goals
were formulated to be achieved by 2010. These were: </p>
<p>
(a) Making school education compulsory and to reduce drop outs.
(b) Reduce infant mortality rate (IMR) to 30 per 1,000 live births.
(c) Reduce maternal mortality rate (MMR) to below 100 per
    1,00,000 live births.
(d) Promote delayed marriage of girls.
(e) Achieve 80 per cent institutional deliveries.
(f) Prevent and control communicable diseases
(g) Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve
    replacement levels to TFR. </p>
<p>
The policy also suggested some promotional and motivational measures
to promote adoption of the small family norm. These were: </p>
<p>
(a) Reward PRIs for promoting small family norm.
(b) Incentives to adopt two-child norms.
(c) Couples below poverty line, having sterilization with not more
    than two living children, will be eligible for health insurance
    plan.
(d) Strengthening abortion facility scheme. </p>

<h1> Family Planning </h1>
<p>
India was the first country to evolve a government-backed family planning
programme in the 1950s. Developing countries like Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea that followed suit have successfully stabilized their population
growth but India, even after 63 years, is trailing behind. Indira Gandhi
government at the Centre implemented a forced sterilization programme. A
separate Department of Family Planning was created in 1966 under the Union
Ministry of Health. During the notorious emergency regime between 1975
and 1977, the Indira Gandhi government at the Centre implemented a forced
sterilization programme against popular wishes and even used such harsh and
coercive methods that today one is reluctant to talk of family planning to the
populace. The programme is still criticized, and is blamed for creating a public </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000119">119</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:119 </h1>
<p>
aversion to family planning, which hampered government programmes for
decades. In fact, for all practical purposes, the country is without an effective
programme for containing growing population. Political parties studiously
skirt the subject, and election campaigns are conducted without a word of it.
What was once a highly dramatic political issue has suddenly become taboo.  </p>
<p>
     In 1977, the Janata Party government formulated a new population
policy ruling out compulsion. The acceptance of the programme was made
purely voluntary. The Family Planning Department was rechristened as the
Family Welfare Department, and tasks beyond its competence embracing all
aspects of family welfare, including improvement of women’s educational
level, were included in it. In its family planning awareness drive, the
Government of India adopted the UNFP guideline of delaying the first child
and spacing the subsequent birth(s).  </p>
<p>
     The methods adopted in family planning are: sterilization, loop, pill,
withdrawal, rhythm, sheath and diaphragm. The condom and the pill seem
most popular among the high socio-economic groups, the withdrawal method
and the condoms among the middle socio—economic groups and sterilization is
preferred by people belonging to the low social strata. Operations for family
planning are not very popular among the socially well-placed, as this group is
exposed to other methods of birth control. A good number of women use
more than one method, depending on the circumstances, availability and the
mood of the moment.  </p>
<p>
     Officially mobilized in 1951, only 147 family planning clinics were
established during the First-Five Year Plan period (1951—56). Since then, a
network of Community Health Centres (CHCs), Primary Health Centres
(PHCs) and sub-centres has been created for implementing family planning
programme through state governments with a hundred per cent central assis-
tance. About 50,000 centres and sub-centres are created in rural areas in each
five-year plan. As on March 2010, there were 1,47,O69 sub-centres, 23,673
PHCS and 4,535 CHCs in the country. The PHCs, engaged in family
planning programmes, perform two specific functions: providing services to
the people and disseminating information about these services in an effective
manner in order to motivate the people to accept family planning. Nearly half
a million medical and para-medical persons were engaged in the programme,
besides half a million part-time village health guides.  </p>

<h1>  Family Welfare Programme </h1>
<p>
It is  a centrally sponsored programme. For this, the states receive 100 per cent
assistance from Central Government. The current policy is to promote family
planning on the basis of voluntary and informed acceptance with full  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000120">120</pagenum>

<p>
community participation. The emphasis is on a two-child family. Also, the
emphasis is on spacing methods along with terminal methods. The services are
taken to every doorstep in order to motivate families to accept the small
family norm</p>
<p>
     The programme had laid down the following goals to be achieved by the
year 2000 AD:</p>
<p>
1. Reduction of birth rate from 29 per 1,000 (in 1992) to 21.
2. Reduction of death rate from 10 (in 1992) to 9 per 1,000.
3. Raising couple protection rate from 43.3 per cent (in 1990) to 60 per
   cent.
4. Reduction in average family size from 4.2 (in 1990) to 2.3.
5. Decrease in infant mortality rate from 79 (in 1992) to less than 60 per
   1,000 live births.
6. Reduction of net reproduction rate from 1.48 (in 1981) to 1.
   Following are the main strategies of the programme: </p>
<p>
(i) Integration with health services: The programme has been integrated with
other health services instead of being a separate service.

(ii) Integration with maternity and child health: The programme has been
integrated with maternity and child health (MCH). Public are motivated
for post—delivery sterilization, abortion and use of contraceptives.

(iii) Concentration in rural areas: The programme is concentrated more in
rural areas at the level of sub-centres and PHCs. This is in addition to
hospitals at district, state and central levels.

(iv) Literacy: There is a direct correlation between illiteracy and fertility. So,
stress and priority is given for girl’s education. Fertility rate among
educated females is low.

(v) Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is encouraged. It is estimated that about 5
million births per annum can be prevented through breastfeeding.

(vi) Raising the age for marriage: Under the Child Marriage Restraint Act,
1978, the age of marriage has been raised to 21 years for males and 18
years for females. This has some impact on fertility.

(vii) Minimum needs programme: It was launched in the Fifth Five-Year Plan
with an aim to raise the economical standards. Fertility is low in higher
income groups. So fertility rate can be lowered by increasing economical
standards.

(viii) Incentives: Monetary incentives have been given in family planning
programmes, especially for poor classes. But these incentives have not
been very effective. So, the programme must be on voluntary basis.

(ix) Mass media: Motivation through radio, television, cinemas, newspapers,
puppet shows and folk dances is an important aspect of this programme. </p>

<h1> A New Approach, Page no:121 </h1>
<p>
A social policy with a new integrated approach to population stabilization has
now been adopted. Following are the components of this new approach:  </p>

<h1> Target-free Programme </h1>
<p>
A significant shift in the family planning programme is the introduction of
target-free programme from April 1996. Targets were a major obsession in
our family planning programme in which village patwaris, school teachers and
government functionaries had to achieve the minimum targets of sterilization
and other measures. Postings, promotions and transfers of functionaries
depended on the fulfilment of targets. A target-free approach is indeed a
welcome change. But only time will show the extent to which the estimated
2. 5 lakh personnel involved in family planning activities will succeed through
the new package of reproductive and child health (RCH) without empha-
sizing on achieving the set targets. </p>

<h1> Bottom-up Approach or Decentralized Participatory Planning </h1>
<p>
Hitherto, planning was done at the top level and percolated down to the grass-
roots for implementation. Now, the programme is to be chalked out at the
village level in consultation with health workers of sub-centre and PHC, i.e,
male and female workers (ANMs), panchayat members and active individuals.
Planning for the district will be the aggregation of PHC plans plus the require—
ments of district hospitals. These District Plans will together make the State
Plan and the State Plans will be aggregated to prepare the National Plan. </p>

<h1> State-specific Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Strategy </h1>
<p>
Since states display a wide variation in health parameters, such as infant
mortalities, maternal mortalities, birth rates, etc., area-specific RCH approach
has been worked out separately for three groups of states plus the special
category states where considerable infrastructure input flows from state health
systems projects.  </p>
<h1> Integrated RCH Package </h1>
<p>
It provides a minimum model framework for reproductive health services at
different levels in the district, namely, sub-centre, PHC and district hospitals.
These services are related to prevention and management of unwanted
pregnancy, maternal care, services for the new-born and infants, and
management of STDs. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000122">122</pagenum>
<h1> Comprehensive Integrated Training, page no:122 </h1>
<p>
Emphasis will be laid on the training of personnel to improve efficiency of
interventions, interpersonal communication, and management. The responsi-
bility of training would be that of a district. The central and the state
governments will support the district in training of trainers, providing
training material and periodic evaluation. </p>

<h1> Increased Involvement of NGOs </h1>
<p>
More NGOs will be involved in clinic-based interventions, in strengthening
community participation in implementing project activities, and in the
training of trainers for technical skills. Private rural medical practitioners,
including those of indigenous systems of medicines will also be involved in
plans. </p>

<h1> Independent Evaluation of Programme </h1>
<p>
The programme will be monitored and evaluated for qualitative performance.
Eighteen Population Resource Centres (PRCs) have been established which
are at present engaged in working out formats for annual surveys. Eight
regional teams have also been constituted by the government for
cross-checking of activities. </p>

<h1> Impact of Family Planning/ Welfare Programme </h1>
<p>
India launched a nation-wide family planning programme in 1952, which was
later expanded to cover maternal and child health, family welfare and
nutrition. The efforts of the government in implementing the programme
have significant impact in the country. Various family welfare activities have
gone a long way in enlightening the people about contraception and its
merits. </p>
<p>
0 Nearly 98 per cent of women and 99 per cent of men in the age group
of 15 and 49 have a good knowledge about one or more methods of
contraception. Adolescents seem to be well aware of the modern
methods of contraception.

0 Over 97 per cent of women and 95 per cent of men are knowledgeable
about female sterilization, which is the most popular modern
permanent method of family planning. While only 79 per cent of
women and 80 per cent of men have heard about male sterilization.

0 93 per cent of men have awareness about the usage of condoms while
only 74 per cent of women are aware of the same.

0 Around 80 per cent of men and women have a fair knowledge about
contraceptive pills. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000123">123</pagenum>
<h1> page no:123 </h1>
<p>
According to Family Welfare Statistics in India (2011) and Census of
India, the year 2010-11 ended with 34.9 million family planning acceptors at
national level comprising of 5million sterilizations, 5.6 million IUD inser-
tions, 16 million condom users and 8.3 million OP users as against 35.6
million family planning acceptors in 2009—10. </p>
<p>
Over the decades, there has also been a substantial increase in contra-
ceptive use in India. For example, during the year 2010—11, 5.6 million IUD
insertions were reported as against 5.7 million in 2009-10. Similarly, there
were 16 million equivalent users of condoms and 83.07 million equivalent
users of oral pills during 2010—11. The implementation of various family
planning measures prevented more than 16 million births in the country
during 2010—11 The cumulative total of births avoided in the country up to
2010—11 was more than 442 million. </p>
<p>
The progress in containing population growth has been extremely slow
as is evident when we compare it with China which has, according to an
estimate, prevented more than 400 million births between 1979 and 2011
through a vigorous family planning programme and brought the fertility rate
down to 1.6 (in 2010) from 5.82 (in 1971). China adopted the norm of one
child per couple in the urban centres and a ceiling of two children per couple
in the rural areas, with several incentives for the planned child as also the
parents. Those who violated these norms were penalized. The planned child
was given special allowances till the age of 14 for education and upbringing,
and the couple was provided with land for building a house or for farm
machinery. A major component of the programme in China is encouraging
late marriage and late childbirth. </p>
<p>
According to NFHS—3, conducted in 2005-06,

0 47 per cent (urban—29.3%; rural 56.2%) women aged 20—24 are
  married by age 18.

0 TFR, i.e., children per woman is 2.7 (urban—2.1; rural—3). Median
  age at first birth for women aged 25-49 years is 19.8 (urban—20.9;
  rural 19.3).

0 56.3 per cent (urban—64%; rural 53%) currently married women aged
  15-49 years are using methods for family planning.

0 Of the total births, only 40.8 per cent (urban—69.4%; rural 31.1%) are
  institutional births.

0 Only 43.5 per cent (urban—57.6%; rural 38.6%) children aged 12—23
  months are fully immunized.

0 Only 46.3 per cent (urban—40.3%; rural 48.3%) children aged 0—5
  months are exclusively breastfed.

0  57.9 per cent (urban-54.6%; rural 59%) of pregnant women aged
   15—49 years are anaemic. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000124">124</pagenum>
<h1> Evaluation of the Programme, Page no:124 </h1>
<p>
During 2010—11, 28.30 million women got registered for ANC check-up and
more than 20 million underwent three check-ups during the pregnancy
period. The institutional deliveries to total deliveries (institutional +home)
increased from 56.7 per cent in 2006—07 to 78.5 per cent in 2010—11. Kerala
and Tamil Nadu (99.8%) are the best performing states in the country during
2010—11.</p>
<p>
During 2010-11, 6,20,472 MTPs were performed by 12,510 approved
institutions in the country. Uttar Pradesh with 576 approved institutions
performed maximum number (81,420) of MTPs in the country, followed by
Maharashtra (78,047) during 2010—11. About 60 per cent MTPs in the country
were performed in six states, viz., Assam, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil
Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in 2010—11.</p>
<p>
The efforts of the government in implementing the Family Planning
Programme in the country have significant impact as shown from the
following: </p>
<p>
0 Knowledge of contraception is nearly universal: 98 per cent of
women and 99 percent of men age 15—49 know one or more methods
of contraception.

0 Among the permanent modern family planning methods, female
sterilization was the most popular. Over 97 percent of women and 95
percent men know about female sterilization. Male sterilization, by
contrast, is known only by 79 percent of women and 87 percent of
men.

0 Ninety-three per cent of men know about condoms, compared with
74 per cent of women.

0 More than 80 percent women and men know about contraceptive pills.
0 Knowledge of contraception is widespread even among adolescents:
94 per cent of young women and 96 per cent of young men have
heard of a modern method of contraception. </p>
<p>
The year 2010—11 ended with 34.9 million total family planning
acceptors at national level comprising of 5 million sterilizations, 5.6 million
IUD insertions, 16 million condom users and 8.3 million OP users as against
35.6 million total family planning acceptors in 2009—10.</p>
<p>
A total of 50.09 lakh sterilizations were performed in the country during
2010—11 as against 49.98 lakh in 2009-10. States/UTs, viz, Assam, Bihar,
Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Arunachal, Manipur,
Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Daman & Diu, Lakshadweep
and Puducherry have shown improved performance in 2010-11 as compared
to 2009-10. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000125">125</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:125 </h1>
<p>
 The proportion of tubectomy operations to total sterilizations was 95.6
per cent in 2010—11 as against 94.6 percent in 2009-10. Though the share of
vasectomy operations to total sterilizations is increasing, it is quite insignificant. </p>
<p>
    During the year 2010-11, 5.6 million IUD insertions were reported as
against 5.7 million in 2009-10. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Uttar
Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Goa, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim and
D&amp;N Haveli reported better performance in 2010—11 than in 2009—10. So far
as the number of condom users and OP users is concerned, there were 16
million users of condoms and 83.07 million users of oral pills during 2010-11. </p>
<p>
   Implementation of various family planning measures averted 16.335
million births in the country during 2010—11 as compared to 16.605 million in
2009-10. The cumulative total of births avoided in the country up to 2010—11
was 442.75 million. </p>

<h1> Attitudes Towards Family Planning </h1>
<p>
The idea of family planning has been sold to an average Indian woman. The
attitude of a woman towards family planning is influenced by her education,
age, income background, husband’s occupation, and her (working) status
among other factors. In terms of age, it has been found that the percentage of
women approving family planning decreases as the age group increases. But,
acceptance is about two-third even among the older age groups. This
clearly shows that the great majority of Indian women approve of family
planning, irrespective of age. A survey conducted by Khanna and Varghese
(Indian Women Today, 1978) on Indian women’s attitudes towards family
planning showed that the percentage of women who did not approve of
family planning was less than 10 in the 15—24 age bracket. The figure increased
with age to reach 36 per cent in women above 45 years. The researchers also
discovered that while women bound to tradition chose to resign themselves to
'fate', only the young, educated and more informed showed a deep concern
for the size of the family. </p>
<p>
 This author also conducted a survey in 1981 in seven villages of Jaipur
district on “Awareness of Rights Among Rural Women”. During the survey,
753 married women (belonging to 18—50 years of age group) and 733 men
were questioned on family planning. To the question pertaining to the
optimum number of children a couple should have, 7 per cent females
answered they should have as many children as they want, 63.5 per cent
wanted 2—3 children and 29.5 per cent wanted 4—5 children. Against this, 60.9
per cent males were of the opinion that a couple should have only 2-3
children, 27.8 per cent were in favour of 4—5 children, and 11.3 per cent
wanted the couple to have as many children as they desired. Thus, about
two-third respondents (66%) were in favour of 2-3 children only. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000126">126</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:126 </h1>
<p>
     But, the situation has now changed a lot. An analysis of 2011 Census
data reveals that the slogan “Hum do, hamare do” seems to finally coming
true, as the median household size in urban India is now less than four for the
first time in history. According to data, 56 per cent of households in urban
India have now four or less members. This is a marked change from the last
census conducted in 2001 when the median household size in urban India was
between four and five. However, in rural India, the median household size is
between four and five, but closer to four than it has ever been. As many as
47.1 per cent of rural households now have four or less members, compared to
40 per cent in 2001 (Times of India March 25,2012).</p>
<p>
      Further, in the above survey of seven villages of Jaipur district, 25 per
cent of the female respondents were not in favour of using any methods of
family planning, 45 per cent were fully in favour and 30 per cent favoured
family planning methods with a few conditions and reservations thrown in.
Of the 566 women who were fully or partially in favour of family planning,
43.3 per cent were actually using some methods to control their family size.
The reasons given by the remaining 321 (or 56.7%) women for not using
contraceptives were: their husbands did not permit the use of any measures
(42.4%); they wanted one or two more children (25.2%); they had crossed the
child—bearing age (15%); the required contraceptives were not available in their
villages (6.5%); they did not have sufficient knowledge about the use of
contraceptives (5%); they had no means to dispose of contraceptives after the
use (2.8%); and they wanted sons as they had only daughters (3.1%). </p>
<p>
     It was also found that 9.4 per cent of the respondents (females) were in
favour of abortion and 90.6 per cent were against it. Another 2.7 per cent had
even undergone abortion. All this shows that women want to control their
fertility and men also want to plan their families. It is also necessary to give
them the required information, education and means to do so through
medical, para-medical, social and community institutions and workers. </p>
<p>
      To predict the need of family planning methods, family planning
managers often rely on unmet need derived from measure of contraceptive
demand. However, woman’s intention and her background knowledge of
family planning methods are not received as much attention as a measure of
family planning methods demand. Therefore, to know the attitude of women
regarding use of family planning methods and to find out the factors that
restricts its use, and the change in pattern of use over a period of one year, a
study (cited in Kathmandu University journal, July-September 2005) was
conducted in Delhi slums. Weakness was narrated as the commonest side
effect from all family planning methods. More than 70 per cent women told,
that irregular menstruation from oral contraceptive pills and ill health from </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000127">127</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:127 </h1>
<p>
tubectomy as the other side effects. Demands for more children and for son
preferences were the leading reason for not using any methods, followed by
afraid of side effects and health problems. There was negligible change in the
use of family planning methods during the period of the study. </p>
<p>
     In a survey conducted in Rajasthan in 1988 by Devendra Kothari (1989:
71), it was found that out of total persons studied, 88.1 per cent were in favour
of family planning and only 11.9 per cent were against it. Kothari (March
1994) also noted that according to the findings of the National Family Welfare
Survey, conducted in Rajasthan in 1993, of the women married in the 13—49
years age group, 90 per cent knew some method of family planning, and 76.2
per cent were aware of some sources of getting the required contraceptives,
though only 31.8 per cent were actually using the contraceptives. </p>
<p>
     A survey was conducted on attitude towards family planning in Vellore
city of Tamil Nadu and its surrounding villages by Rao and Inbaraj in 1970. In
all 2,426 persons were interviewed with the intention of finding out whether
they considered it within the power of the couple to control the number of
children. Around 37 per cent replied in the affirmative and 41 per cent replied
in the negative. Of those 899 persons who considered it possible, 46.6 per cent
considered it possible through family planning measures, 37.5 per cent
through control on the self, while 15.9 per cent did not point to any specific
method. When they were asked whether they themselves were in favour of
family planning, 64.6 per cent said ‘Yes’ and 25.4 per cent said ‘No’. The
reasons given for the hostility to family planning methods were: it was
harmful to women, it went against family economy, it was against god’s will,
and it constituted unnatural behaviour. However, since seven out of every ten
persons were in favour of family planning, it points to the fact that people
have ceased to be very traditional in their beliefs and values. </p>
<p>
      A study made by the National Institute of Community Development
covering 365 villages in 16 states and 43 districts and 7,224 respondents also
revealed that 51.6 per cent were in favour of family planning and 23.7 per cent
were against it. </p>
<p>
      Khanna and Varghese’s survey showed that the acceptance of family
planning is directly related to education. As many as 40 per cent of women with
primary school education or below did not favour family planning. If education
level increases to even the middle school level, the percentage drops to 14 per
cent. This shows that education brings about a change in the attitude to family
planning. If a woman remains unexposed to family planning methods, she
continues to be conservative and holds on superstitious beliefs and fears. </p>
<p>
informal education also affects the practice of family planning methods.
Many young women are in favour of family planning but do not know how </p>

<p>
to go about it. The illiteracy of the husband also acts as a barrier because they
remain unconcerned about planning the family. </p>
<p>
    Since illiteracy is found more among the poorer section of our society, it
is seen that women with low education in the lower strata are more reluctant
to accept family planning methods. Their contention is that since they have
no money to fall back upon, their only hope of survival is their children's
income. An average poor Indian couple is not satisfied with less than two or
three children. Time and again, studies in various parts of the country have
revealed this fact. About a decade ago, a large—scale survey covering some
32,000 respondents sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
came to the conclusion that most couples wanted not only three or more
children but they also wanted that two of them should be sons (The Hindustan
Times, November 5,1987). </p>
<p>
   A survey was conducted in 1991 on “Socialization of Indian Youth
About Population” by the Family Planning Foundation, Delhi in collabo-
ration with Operation Research Group, Delhi. This survey studied the
attitudes of 17,185 male and female children selected from 251 schools from
urban and rural areas of 22 districts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and
Delhi. A large number of the respondents were in favour of a two-child
family. Though about 90 per cent subjects preferred one son and one daughter
but 73 per cent were not very keen about giving importance to the sex of the
children. A majority of the respondents did not consider the age of marriage
of both boys and girls below 22 years as the correct marriage age. A good
number of them had some knowledge about some contraceptives but they
were not very clear about it. A large number had acquired this knowledge
from the TV (The Hindustan Times, March 15, 1992).</p>
<p>
   The encouraging feature is that though the older generation is inclined
towards passive helplessness, they want their daughters to have fewer children
and adopt birth control methods. In the rural areas, it has been observed that a
woman with six children now compels her married daughter to undergo an
operation to stop childbirth after her third delivery. In the urban areas,
especially with the breakdown of the joint family system, many women in
nuclear families face difficulties in bringing up children. Servants are a
problem and there is no help from the inlaws or one’s own mother. Housing
is often a problem and commodities are scarce. No wonder that urban women
in the younger age group favour family planning methods which allow them
to devote their attention to their careers. </p>
<p>
    Though a large number of women approve of family planning, only half
of them actually practise it. Khanna and Varghese’s survey revealed that the
lower the social strata, the more ignorant a woman is about family planning </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000129">129</pagenum>

<p>
methods. From over 75 per cent use of contraceptives in the high
socio—economic strata, the percentage came down to 56 per cent in the middle
and dropped to 19.5 per cent in the lower socio—economic group in their
survey. The message is loud and clear: women in the low and middle strata
need to be more effectively covered by family planning methods than those
who are economically better off. </p>

<h1> Measures Suggested to Contain Population Explosion </h1>
<p>
The continuing population explosion in our country calls for some soul
searching. The government is aware of the magnitude of the problem and
considers the alarming population growth as the biggest challenge facing the
nation as well as the government. But, the 1976—77 experience of the
government in adopting serious measures to achieve the set targets in the field
of family planning has made all the following governments very cautious.
There is, however, still time to act. The following programmes may be
suggested to check population growth: </p>

<h1> Incentives vs Disincentives </h1>
<p>
An important question has now been raised by some thinkers pertaining to
popular policy—that of cooperation vs coercion, or incentives vs disincen-
tives, or Kerala model vs Chinese model? There are some thinkers who support
cooperation while there are others who support coercion. Nobel laureate
Professor Amartya Sen, in a prestigious JRD Tata Memorial Lecture in Delhi in
August 1995 on “Population Stabilization Programme” favoured ‘cooperation’
approach and denounced the use of coercion to bring down the lines of two
famous theories of Condorcet (of France) and Malthus (of Britain). He
supported Condorcet’s approach to the problem of population which talked of
the emergence of new norms of small family size based on “the progress of
reason”. Condorcet believed that female education would lead people to choose
voluntarily smaller families and lower fertility rates. Malthus, however, was
skeptical about this view of “voluntary acceptance of family planning”. In his
opinion, “positive checks” such as economic penury or rise in mortality rate
would eventually coerce people to reduce population growth rate. Sen
described Condorcet’s path of cooperation as unequivocally right and Malthus’
path of coercion as undesirable and even counter-productive in checking
population growth. He gave the example of Kerala in support of his viewpoint
and developed a hypothesis called “Kerala hypothesis of demographic
transition". In this hypothesis, increase in literacy and primary health care are
described  as two important factors in population control. But, while supporting
his hypothesis, Sen has ignored some figures pertaining to Kerala. Ignoring such
facts only render the hypothesis untenable. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000130">130</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:130 </h1>
<p>
 Opposed to the “Kerala model” is the “Chinese model” of coercion in
population control. Looking at the near catastrophic state of our population
scenario, thinkers support this “coercive model” as the only effective solution
of the population problem. These thinkers also point out the vested political
interests that are promoting population growth rates of various vote banks to
the detriment of the nation. Some thinkers, however, talk of the combination
of cooperation and coercion or incentive and disincentives to check India's
population growth, but the nature of disincentives has not been identified so
far. Would denying the “benefit of reservation” to people with more than two
children prove a disincentive? Can denying promotion or admission or a
voting right or right to contest election be disincentives? Will such denials not
be the violation of fundamental rights? Laying down mechanisms to
implement the disincentives in the prevailing socio—political situation in India,
particularly when thirteen political parties with different ideologies on “social
justice and reservation issue” can join together to form a UPA government at
the Centre, will not be easy. </p>

<h1> Division into Zones and Regions </h1>

<p>
A study conducted in February 1990 by two population experts of the
Operation Research Group at Baroda has shown how the problem could be
tackled. On the basis of the fertility pattern, they have divided the country's
350 districts into 16 zones and four regions. They have identified districts and
zones which reflect the positive impact of family planning on the fertility
rates, the areas where fertility rates have remained low despite hardly any
family planning efforts, and those regions which are the hard core areas where
the maximum effort is needed. The 1990 survey had pointed out that the areas
of high fertility are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh,
Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan (birth rate varying between 34% and 37.7% in
1990 and between 32% and 35% in 1995). This region-wise approach is
expected to help in correcting the lacuna in the implementation of the family
planning programme.   </p>

<h1> Searching for New Contraceptives </h1>
<p>
The search for a new, inexpensive, easy to use and harmless contraceptive has
not met with dramatic success so far. Though pills have come to be accepted,
in a big way and this method is catching on in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh,
Punjab, West Bengal, Gujarat and Odisha, it is necessary that Indian herbs also
be thoroughly investigated for their effects. Pursuing vigorous investigation of
the health status and dietary habits of some of the tribals in Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, among some of whom the fertility rate is found to be
extremely low, might provide the needed solution.   </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000131">131</pagenum>
<h1> Increase in Marriage Age, page no:131 </h1>
<p>
    There is a direct relationship between age of marriage, size of family and
attitude towards family planning. Several scholars have devoted their
attention to explain this unprecedented phenomenon in Kerala. During the
1950's population growth in the state was one of the highest in the country.
However, by 1970s, it began to fall significantly and subsequently became the
lowest among the Indian states. During 1981—1991, the growth rate dropped
to 14.3 per cent and in the next decade it further came down to 9.4 per cent
whereas the corresponding figures for India were 23.9 per cent and 21.3 per
cent. This all happened due to the rise in age at marriage and higher level of
contraception. Sociologically, this is an important reason for the dramatic
decline in birth rate in Kerala. Raising the marriage age is, thus, bound to
reduce the family size in other states too. This calls for serious and
whole-hearted efforts for creating the necessary public awareness. </p>

<h1> Economic Development </h1>
<p>
Economic development may prove to be the best contraceptive. We have to go
for quick population control at any cost on sheer economic principles of supply
and demand. To balance any economic equation, we can either increase the
supply which depends on both financial and material resources, or reduce the
demand which depends on the number of people asking for varied services and
commodities. For example, on the supply side, in housing alone, an annual
outlay of Rs 10,000 crore would be required to build four million houses for the
16 million people added to country’s population every year, assuming that we
require only Rs 2.5 lakh to build one small house. But if we tackle the same
problem from the demand side and prevent the annual addition of 16 million to
the population through an effective population control strategy, the demand
for three million houses or Rs 10,000 crore required per year for constructing
the houses will disappear. Thus, preventing the demand is as good as working
for the supply. This is balancing the supply and demand at no cost. And, it is
the no-cost solution we are looking for. What applies to housing also holds
good for education, jobs, transport and health sectors. Tackling each problem
dfrom the demand side will have an enormous pay off. </p>
<p>
     This approach has another important dimension. If we tackle the
problem from the supply side, it will increase the demand per se in other
sectors. For example, if we increase the number of houses, it would increase
demand for cement, bricks, wood material and electrical goods. But if we
approach the problem from the demand side and reduce the number of houses
needed, the pressure in all sectors will be relieved. With 29 births every
minute or about 16 million births every year, the demand for money and
materials in sectors like education, transport and welfare, will so enormously
increase that in ten years’ time the situation will have crossed the point of no  </p>

<p>
own programme, it may not be possible to achieve the desired results. This
can be achieved in a better way by the non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) as these have very intimate relations with the people. Their role in
removing deep-rooted beliefs favouring large families and male children,
improving female literacy, raising age at marriage of girls, essential newborn
care, birth spacing, etc., can be very significant. Such organizations not only
have the capacity to reach the remote areas but their activities are
cost-effective also. The Department of Family Welfare has launched several
schemes over the years to ensure better participation of the NGOs in the
family welfare programme. Some of these schemes are: (1) Helping NGOs to
the extent of 90 per cent of the cost of the project on promotion of small
family norm and population control schemes. (2) Wide publicity of the
government for informing voluntary organizations to come forward to
undertake these schemes. (3) Holding of a number of regional conferences in
last four to five years to increase the involvement of the NGOs. (4) Recog-
nizing its larger organizations in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and
Lucknow as Mother Units for identifying small NGOs in their areas and
giving them grants for approval schemes. (5) Setting up State Standing
Committees on Voluntary Action set up under the chairmanship of the
Family Welfare Secretary with power to sanction upto Rs 10 lakh per project.
(6)Asking states to identify one institution in the NGO sector for the purpose
of providing training to health workers. (7) Arranging study tours for NGOS
from states with poor community participation to better performing states. </p>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<p>
The population policy of our government should aim not only at controlling
the unregulated human growth of numerical strength (population explosion)
but also at checking the unregulated movement of population and the
increasing concentration of people in the urbanized areas (population
implosion), and providing adequate living space and attractive environment to
heterogeneous mixture of people (population displosion). These goals have to
be jointly linked with the formulation and implementation of policies aimed
at population regulation and planning for harnessing both natural and human
resources. Thus, only population growth per se may not be perceived as a
problem but its relation with the availability of resources may be viewed with
great concern (Misra, 1980: 272-73). </p>
<p>
     Family planning needs to be salvaged from the morass into which it has
drifted. For this, the programme has to look inwards and treat itself as a devel-
opment input in its own right. In fact, development is the best method of
controlling population growth though the reverse is also true that high
population growth is a sure recipe for slow, if not negative development. A </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000133">133</pagenum>

<p>
variety of measures will have to be introduced to put the family planning
campaign back on its feet. Compulsion will not work; only persuasion will
succeed. Legal measures may help, but what is urgently required is social
awareness and involvement to create responsible parenthood.</p>
<p>
    What is to be stressed most in achieving a commensurate demographic
effect is promoting spacing method instead of overemphasizing on steril-
ization in the family planning programme. About three-fifths (57.1%) of the
married women in our country are under the age of 22 years and already
mothers of two or more children. We have to check the phenomenon of
“children producing children”. This could be achieved only by promoting
spacing methods and marrying girls after 21 years of age.  </p>
<p>
   In addition to its important role in checking the population explosion,
family planning will help to improve the general status of women. A woman
who has a large number of children to support and who goes through
repeated deliveries spends more time as a mother and a wife and is confined to
the four walls of her home. She cannot play any role in the community and
the society, unless she is able to limit her family to a reasonable size. Family
planning will improve not only family welfare but will also contribute to
social prosperity and individual happiness. </p>

<p>
                          Ageing
Ageing is  an ongoing biological process which no human being can escape. It
begins at birth or, to be more precise, at conception, and ends with death. In
other words, a society ages when there is an increase in its elderly population
along with decrease in the rest of the population. It is the result of
demographic transition in which a population moves from high to low
fertility and mortality rates. This inevitable and irreversible process affects
one's physical and psychological well-being. Besides, it is said to have social,
economic and cultural implications too. Therefore, the studies on ageing are
significant for understanding the problems related to elderly care, which is  an
urgent need in the 21st century. </p>

<h1> Defining Ageing/ Old Age </h1>
<p>
Although everyone is familiar with ageing, defining it is not so easy. Elderly
or old age consists of ages nearing or surpassing the average life span of human
beings. The boundary of old age cannot be defined exactly because it does not
have the same meaning in all societies. However, despite a number of
commonly used definitions of old age, there is no general agreement on the
age at which a person becomes old. Though most countries of developed
world have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of
'elderly' or older person, but like many westernized concepts, this does not
adapt well to the situation in developing or underdeveloped countries. At the
moment, there is no United Nations standard numerical criterion, but its
agreed cutoff is 60+ years to refer to the older population. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000135">135</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:135 </h1>
<p>
Lacking an accepted and acceptable definition, in many instances, the age
at which a person becomes eligible for statutory and occupational retirement
pensions has become the default definition. According to Gorman (2000),
“The ageing process is of course a biological reality which has its own
dynamic, largely beyond human control. However, it is also subject to the
constructions by which each society makes sense of old age. In the developed
world, chronological time plays a paramount role. The age of 60 or 65
roughly equivalent to retirement ages in most developed countries, is said to
be the beginning of old age. In many parts of the developing world, chrono-
logical age has little or no importance in the meaning of old age. Other
socially constructed meanings of age are more significant such as the roles
assigned to older people; in some cases it is the loss of roles accompanying
physical decline which is significant in defining old age. Thus, in contrast to
the chronological milestones which mark life stages in the developed world,
old age in many developing countries is seen to begin at the point when active
contribution is no longer possible. ”  </p>
<p>
    When attention was drawn to older populations in many developing
countries, the definition of old age many times followed the same path as that in
more developed countries, that is, the government sets the definition by stating
a retirement age. Later, results of an international anthropological study
conducted in Africa in late 1970s provided a basis for a definition of old age in
developing countries (Glascock and Feinman, 1980). Definitions fell into three
main categories: (i) chronology; (ii) change in social role (i.e., change in work
patterns, adult status of children and menopause); and (iii) change in capabilities
(i. e., invalid status, senility and change in physical characteristics). Results from
this cultural analysis of old age suggested that change in social role is the
predominant means of defining old age. When the preferred definition was
chronological, it was most often accompanied by an additional definition. </p>
<p>
     These results somewhat contradict the findings of a more recent study
conducted in Nigeria regarding perceptions about the onset of old age
(Togunu-Bikersteth, 1987 and 1988). Younger and older age groups had
similar responses regarding the chronological onset of old age, with differ-
ences in the stated age for men and women. The results suggested that the
generally accepted definition was similar to westernized definitions of old age;
however, this was a unique community with culture-related norms that
bestowed certain privileges and benefits at older ages. If one considers the
self-definition of old age, that is old people defining old age, as people enter
older ages it seems their self-definitions of old age become decreasingly multi-
faceted and increasingly related to health status (Brubaker and Powers, 1976;
Johnson, 1976; Freund and Smith, 1997).  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000136">136</pagenum>
<h1> page no:136 </h1>
<p>
    While a single definition, such as chronological age or
social/ cultural/ functional markers, is commonly used by, amongst others,
demographers, sociologists, anthropologists, economists and researchers, it
seems more appropriate to use a combination of chronological, functional and
social definitions. However, the challenge of how to incorporate a suitable
multidimensional definition into the ‘pensionable age’ concept remains. </p>
<p>
   However, despite these problems, there exist, as stated above, many
commonly used definitions of ‘ageing’. </p>
<p>
   According to Wikipedia, ageing is a change in an organism over time. It
refers to a multidimensional process of physical, psychological and social
change (Hultsch and Deutsch, cited in Parikh, 2011). Some dimensions of
ageing grow and expand over time, while others decline. Reaction time, for
example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom
may expand (Schaie, cited in Parikh, 2011). Research shows that even late in
life potential exists for physical, mental and social growth and development.
Ageing is an important part of all human societies reflecting the biological
changes that occur, but also reflecting cultural and societal conventions. Age is
usually measured in full years- and months for young children. A person's
birthday is often an important event. </p>
<p>
  Chronological ageing, referred to how old a person is, is arguably the
most straightforward definition of ageing and may be distinguished from
'social ageing’ (society’s expectations of how people should act as they grow
older) and ‘biological ageing’ (an organism’s physical state as it ages). </p>
<p>
     Bhatia (1983, cited in Saluja, 2011) defined the term ‘ageing’ from three
perspectives: biological, psychological and socio-cultural. Biological ageing
refers to bodily changes that occur in the later part of the life of an individual
that include graying of hair, loss of teeth and the diminishing of sight and
audibility. Psychological ageing is studied in terms of changes in the nervous
system and it consists of general decline in the mental abilities that accompany
old age. It also includes the attitude and behaviour of others towards them.
Socio-cultural ageing refers to changes in the individual, and changing circum-
stances as a member of family, community and society. These changes include
completion of parental role, retirement from work, reduced income, diseases,
disability and need for support. </p>
<p>
   Mukherji (1972, cited 1n Saluja, 2011), while defining ageing, distin-
guishes between biological, sociological and psychological age. According to
him, biologically, a person may be old but if he or she possesses a youthful
mentality, sociologically and psychologically speaking, he or she should be
included in the younger generation. </p>
<p>
    According to Tibbittis (1960, cited in Saluja, 2011), ageing may be best
defined as the survival of a growing number of people who have completed </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000137">137</pagenum>
<h1> page no:137 </h1>
<p>
their traditional adult roles of making a living and child rearing and years
following the completion of these tasks, represent an ‘extension of life’. It is
also said that aged acquire knowledge through experience and so are of much
help to young in a number of ways. </p>
<p>
     In Indian context, the National Policy on Older Persons, 1999 defines
‘senior citizen’ or 'elderly' as a person who is of age 60 years and above. </p>
<p>
    Thus, in brief, ageing means deteriorative biological and psychological
changes that occur in genetically matured organism. Indeed these changes are
irreversible, weaken the organism’s ability for survival and adjustment, and
eventually cause the organism’s death. </p>

<h1> Problems Faced by the Aged </h1>
<p>
In general, the following problems are faced by an elderly person:
   (i) Failing health: It has been rightly said that “we start dying the day we
are born”. The ageing process is synonymous with failing health. While death
in young people in countries such as India is mainly due to infectious diseases,
older people are mostly vulnerable to non—communicable diseases. Failing
health due to advancing age is complicated by non-availability to good Quality,
age-sensitive, health care for a large proportion of older persons in the
country. In addition, poor accessibility and reach, lack of information and
knowledge and/ or high costs of disease management make reasonable elder
care beyond the reach of older persons, especially those who are poor and
disadvantaged. </p>
<p>
To address the issue of failing health, it is of prime importance that good
quality health care be made available and accessible to the elderly in an
age-sensitive manner. Health services should address preventive measures
keeping in mind the diseases that affect—or are likely to affect—the commu-
nities in a particular geographical region. In addition, effective care and
support is required for those elderly suffering from various diseases through
primary, secondary and tertiary health care systems. The cost (to the affected
elderly individual or family) of health has to be addressed so that no person is
denied necessary health care for financial reasons. Rehabilitation, community
or home based disability support and end-of-life care should also be provided
where needed, in a holistic manner, to effectively address the issue to failing
health among the elderly. </p>
<p>
   (ii) Economic insecurity: The problem of economic insecurity is faced by
the elderly when they are unable to sustain themselves financially. Many older
persons either lack the opportunity and/ or the capacity to be as productive as
they were. Increasing competition from younger people, individual, family
and societal mind sets, chronic malnutrition and slowing physical and mental </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000138">138</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:138 </h1>
<p>
faculties, limited access to resources and lack of awareness of their rights and
entitlements play significant roles in reducing the ability of the elderly to
remain financially productive, and thereby, independent.   </p>
<p>
   Economic security is as relevant for the elderly as it is for those of any
other age group. Those who are unable to generate an adequate income
should be facilitated to do so. As far as possible, elderly who are capable,
should be encouraged, and if necessary, supported to be engaged in some
economically productive manner. Others who are incapable of supporting
themselves should be provided with partial or full social welfare grants that at
least provide for their basic needs. Families and communities may be
encouraged to support the elderly living with them through counselling and
local self-governance.   </p>
<p>
   (iii) Isolation: Isolation, or a deep sense of loneliness, is a common
complaint of many elderly is the feeling of being isolated. While there are a
few who impose it on themselves, isolation is most often imposed purpose-
fully or inadvertently by the families and/ or communities where the elderly
live. Isolation is a terrible feeling that, if not addressed, leads to tragic deterio-
ration of the quality of life. </p>
<p>
      It is important that the elderly feel included in the goings-on around
them, both in the family as well as in society. Those involved in elder care,
especially NGOs in the field, can play a significant role in facilitating this
through counseling of the individual, of families, sensitization of community
leaders and group awareness or group counselling sessions. Activities centered
on older persons that involve their time and skills help to inculcate a feeling of
inclusion. Some of these could also be directly useful for the families and the
communities. </p>
<p>
  (iv) Neglect: The elderly, especially those who are weak and/ or
dependent, require physical, mental and emotional care and support. When
this is not provided, they suffer from neglect, a problem that occurs when a
person is left uncared for and that is often linked with isolation. Changing
lifestyles and values, demanding jobs, distractions such as television, a shift to
nuclear family structures and redefined priorities have led to increased
self neglect of the elderly by families and communities. This is worsened as
the elderly are less likely to demand attention than those of other age groups. </p>
<p>
    The best way to address neglect of the elderly is to counsel families,
sensitize community leaders and address the issue at all levels in different
forums, including the print and audio-visual media. Schools and work places
offer opportunities where younger generations can be addressed in groups.
Government and non-government agencies need to take this issue up
seriously at all these levels. In extreme situations, legal action and   </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000139">139</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:139 </h1>
<p>
rehabilitation may be required to reduce or prevent the serious consequences
of the problem. </p>
 <p>
  (v) Abuse: The elderly are highly vulnerable to abuse, where a person is
willfully or inadvertently harmed, usually by someone who is part of the
family or otherwise close to the victim. It is very important that steps be
taken, whenever and wherever possible, to protect people from abuse. Being
relatively weak, elderly are vulnerable to physical abuse. Their resources
including finances ones are also often misused. In addition, the elderly may
suffer from emotional and mental abuse for various reasons and in different
ways. The major forms of abuse are physical, sexual, psychological and
economic, which are discussed in detail in the latter part of the chapter. </p>
<p>
The best form of protection from abuse is to prevent it. This should be
carried out through awareness generation in families and in the communities
In most cases, abuse is carried out as a result of some frustration and the felt
need to inflict pain and misery on others. It is also done to emphasize
authority. Information and education of groups of people from younger
generations is necessary to help prevent abuse. The elderly should also be
made aware of their rights in this regard. </p>
 <p>
Where necessary, legal action needs be taken against those who
willfully abuse elders, combined with counseling of such persons so as to
rehabilitate them. Elderly who are abused also require to be counseled, and
if necessary rehabilitated to ensure that they are able to recover with
minimum negative impact. </p>
 <p>
(vi) Fear: Many older persons live in fear. Whether rational or irrational,
this is a relevant problem face by the elderly that needs to be carefully and
effectively addressed.  </p>
<p>
Elderly who suffer from fear need to be reassured. Those for whom the
fear is considered to be irrational need to be counseled and, if necessary, may
be treated as per their needs. In the case of those with real or rational fear, the
cause and its preventive measures needs to be identified followed by appro-
priate action where and when possible. </p>
<p>
(vii) Boredom(Idleness): Boredom is a result of being poorly motivated to
be useful or productive and occurs when a person is unwilling or unable to do
something meaningful with his/ her time. The problem occurs due to forced
inactivity, withdrawal from responsibilities and lack of personal goals. A
person who is not usefully occupied tends to physically and mentally decline
and this in turn has a negative emotional impact. Most people who have
reached the age of 60 years or more have previously led productive lives and
would have gained several skills during their life-time. Identifying these skills
would be a relatively easy task. Motivating them and enabling them to use </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000140">140</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:140 </h1>
<p>
these skills is a far more challenging process that requires determination and
consistent effort by dedicated people working in the same environment as the
affected elders. </p>
<p>
     Many elderly can be trained to carry out productive activities that would
be useful to them or benefit their families, communities or environment;
activities that others would often be unable or unwilling to do. Being
meaningfully occupied, many of the elderly can be taught to keep boredom
away. For others, recreational activities can be devised and encouraged at little
or no additional cost. </p>
<p>
(viii) Lowered self-esteem: Lowered self-esteem among older persons has a
complex etiology that includes isolation, neglect, reduced responsibilities and
decrease in value or worth by oneself, family and/ or the society. </p>
<p>
       To restore self-confidence, one needs to identify and address the cause
and remove it. While isolation and neglect have been discussed above,
self-worth and value can be improved by encouraging the elderly to take part
in family and community activities, learning to use their skills, developing
new ones or otherwise keeping themselves productively occupied. In serious
situations, individuals—and their families—may require counseling and/ or
treatment </p>
<p>
   (ix) Loss of control: This problem of older persons has many facets. While
self-realization and the reality of the situation is acceptable to some, there are
others for whom life becomes insecure when they begin to lose control of
their resources—physical strength, body systems, finances (income), social or
designated status and decision making powers. </p>
<p>
    Early intervention, through education and awareness generation, is needed
to prevent a negative feeling to inevitable loss of control. It is also important for
society—and individuals—to learn to respect people for what they are instead of
who they are and how much they are worth. When the feeling is severe,
individuals and their families may be counseled to deal with this. Improving the
health of the elderly through various levels of health care can also help to improve
control. Finally, motivating the elderly to use their skills and training them to be
productive  will help gain respect and appreciation. </p>
<p>
   (x) Lack of preparedness for old age: A large number of people enter ‘old
age' with little, or no, awareness of what this entails. While demographically,
we acknowledge that a person is considered to be old when (s)he attains the
age of 60 years, there is no such clear indicator available to the individual. For
each person, there is a turning point after which (s)he feels physiologically or
functionally ‘old’. This event could take place at any age before or after the
age of 60. Unfortunately, in India, there is almost no formal awareness
programme—even at higher level institutions or organizations—for people to </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000141">141</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:141 </h1>
<p>
prepare for old age. For the vast majority of people, old age sets in quietly, but
suddenly, and few are prepared to deal with its issues. Most people living busy
lives during the young and middle age periods may prefer to turn away from,
and not consider, the possible realities of their own impending old age.  </p>
<p>
The majority of Indians are unaware of the rights and entitlements of
older persons.  </p>
<p>
The problem of not being prepared for old age can only be prevented
Awareness generation through the work place is a good beginning with HR
departments taking an active role in preparing employees to face retirement
and facing old age issues. For the majority who have unregulated occupations
and for those who are self—employed, including farmers, awareness can be
generated through the media and also through government offices and by
NGOs in the field. Older people who have faced and addressed these issues
can be ‘recruited’ to address groups at various forums to help people prepare
for, or cope with, old age.  </p>

<h1> Indian Scenario </h1>
<p>
The population of elderly is growing everywhere in the world. In the last
century, the proportion of population aged 60 and above has increased in
almost all the countries of the world. According to an estimate, about 600
million people were aged 60 and above at the turn of new millennium and this
number is expected to further increase mainly due to substantial
improvement in life expectancy throughout the world. This has become
possible because of improvement in public health and medical advances in the
prevention of many deadly epidemic diseases.   </p>
<p>
The tremendous growth of the elderly population is not unique to the
industrialized or developed societies. People in the age group 65 and above in
European and Asian industrialized nations now account for at least 15 to 20
percent of their nations’ population. By 2025, the 60-plus world population is
expected to approach 1.2 billion people. In most nations, the older population
is growing faster than the population as a whole.  </p>
<p>
India is also heading towards the similar demographic pattern (i.e., low
birth rate and low death rate) like other developed countries of the world. The
elderly or senior citizens (aged 60 years and above) in India numbered 76.7
million (37.8 million males and 38.8 million females) in 2001 registering an
increase of 19.9 million persons compared to their number in 1991.In
percentage terms, the share of elderly population, which was 6.8 per cent of
the total population in 1991, increased to 7.4 per cent in 2001, and 1s expected
to further increase to more than 10 per cent by the year 2021. For males it was
marginally lower at 7.1 per cent, while for females it was 7.8 per cent. Further,  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000142">142</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:142 </h1>
<p>
there were 8 million citizens (3.9 million males and 4.1 million females) above
80 years of age (Premi, 2011), who are termed ‘super senior citizens’. In 2011
census, the grey population in the country is estimated to be around...

<p>
Apart from the steady rise in the number of elderly, the traditional roles
of these people have changed a lot due to such reasons as modernization,
urbanization, industrialization, etc. Traditionally, in India, aged enjoyed
honour, respect and legitimate authority within the family and society but in
modern times the younger generation has replaced them in strategic positions
leaving them in a weakened and functionless situation. Today, they are
viewed as non-productive and dependent lots. Thus, there is need to initiate
requisite appropriate programmes and policy interventions on the part of the
government to ensure life and dignity for its senior citizens.  </p>

<h1> Policy and Programme Initiatives for Elderly Welfare </h1>
<p>
The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, which is the nodal ministry
for this purpose focuses on policies and programmes for the senior citizens in
close collaboration with state governments, non-governmental organizations
and civil society. The programmes aim at their welfare and maintenance,
especially for indigent senior citizens, by supporting old age homes, day care
centres,mobile medicare units, etc.</p>

<h1> Constitutional Provisions </h1>
<p>
Article 41 of the Constitution provides that the state shall, within the limits of
its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing
the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000143">143</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:143 </h1>
<p>
 unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and 1n other casesJ
undeserved want. </p>
<p>
   Further, Article 47 provides that the state shall regard the raising of the
level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement
of public health as among its primary duties. </p>

<h1> Legislations </h1>
<p>
General improvement in the health care facilities over the years is one of the
main reasons for continuing increase in proportion of population of senior
citizens. Ensuring that they not merely live longer, but lead a secure, dignified
and productive life, is a major challenge, the Government of India enacted the
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act in 2007. The main
purpose of bringing out this Act was to provide for more effective provisions
for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens guaranteed and
recognized under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or
thereto. In a nutshell, the Act provides for: </p>
<p>
0 maintenance of parents/ senior citizens by children/ relatives made
  obligatory and justiciable through tribunals;
0 revocation of transfer of property by senior citizens in case of negli-
  gence by relatives;
0 penal provision for abandonment of senior citizens;
0 establishment of Old Age Homes for indigent senior citizens; and
  adequate medical facilities and security for senior citizens. </p>
 <p>
    Section 19 of the Act also envisages a provision of at least old age home
for indigent senior citizens with 150 capacities in every district of the country. </p>
<p>
   The Act has to be brought into force by individual state government. As
on February 2010, the Act had been notified by 22 states and all UTs. It is
however not applicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, while Himachal
Pradesh has its own Act for senior citizens but citizens of India living abroad
will come within its purview. </p>
<p>
    Rajasthan is among the first states that has notified the Maintenance and
Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 and made rules thereunder,
called Rajasthan Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens
Rules, 2010. Accordingly, parents, grandparents and senior citizens who are
unable to maintain themselves from their own income and property are
entitled to demand maintenance from their children and specified relatives
respectively with sufficient means. The maintenance would include provision
for food, clothing, residence, medical attendance and treatment. The
maximum amount which may be ordered for maintenance of a senior citizen
by the tribunal shall be such as prescribed by the State Government which
shall not exceed Rs. 10,000 per month. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000144">144</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:144 </h1>
<p>
 Rajasthan has also established tribunals at sub-divisional levels with the
Sub-Divisional Officer presiding over it to monitor the status of the senior
citizens in the area and book the erring wards. The State Government has also
constituted an appellate authority in each district to hear appeals against the
orders of the tribunal. The district magistrate of the concerned district would
be the presiding officer of the appellate tribunal. The District Social Welfare
Officers of the Social Welfare and Empowerment Department have been
designated as the Maintenance Officers (Hindu, 11 June 2010).</p>

<h1> National Policy on Older Persons, 1999 </h1>
<p>
The National Policy on Older Persons (NPOP) was announced in January
1999 to reaffirm the commitment to ensure the well-being of the older
persons. The policy envisages state support to ensure financial and food
security, health care, shelter and other needs of older persons, equitable share
in development, protection against abuse and exploitation, and availability of
services to improve the quality of their lives. The primary objectives are: </p>
<p>
0  to encourage individuals to make provision for their own as well as
   their spouse’s old age;

0  to encourage families to take care of their older family members;

0 to enable and support voluntary and non-governmental organiza-
  tions to supplement the care provided by the family;

0 to provide care and protection to the vulnerable elderly people;

0 to provide adequate healthcare facility to the elderly;

0 to promote research and training facilities to train geriatric care givers and
  Organizers of services for the elderly; and

0 to create awareness regarding elderly persons to help them lead
  productive and

0 independent live. </p>
<p>
     The implementation strategy adopted for operationalization of national
policy envisages the following: </p>
<p>
0 Preparation of plan of action for operationalization of the national
   policy.

0 Setting up of separate Bureau for Older Persons in Ministry of Social
  Justice & Empowerment.

0 Setting up of Directorates of Older Persons in the states.

0 Three-Yearly Public Review of implementation of policy.

0 Setting up of a National Council for Older Persons headed by
   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment from Central Ministry,
   states, non-official members representing NGOs, academic bodies,
   media and experts as members. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000145">145</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:145 </h1>
<p>
0 Establishment of an autonomous National Association of Older
  Persons.
0 Encouraging the participation of local self-government.  </p>

<h1> National Council for Older Persons </h1>
<p>
In pursuance of the NPOP, a National Council for Older Persons (NCOP)
was constituted in 1999 under the chairpersonship of the Minister for Social
Justice and Empowerment to oversee implementation of the policy. The
NCOP is the highest body to advise the government in the formulation and
implementation of policy and programmes for the aged. The Council was
re-constituted in 2005 with members comprising central and state govern-
ments, representatives of NGOs, citizens’ groups, retired persons’
associations, and experts in the field of law, social welfare, and medicine. </p>

<h1> Inter-Ministerial Committee on Older Persons </h1>
<p>
An Inter-Ministerial Committee on Older Persons comprising 22 minis-
tries/ departments, and headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice &
Empowerment is another coordination mechanism in implementation of the
NPOP. Action plan on ageing issues for implementation by various minis-
tries/ departments concerned is considered from time to time by the
committee. </p>

<h1> Central Sector Scheme of Integrated Programme for Older Persons </h1>
<p>
An Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP) is being implemented
since 1992 with the objective of improving the quality of life of senior citizens
by providing basic amenities like shelter, food, medical care and enter-
tainment opportunities and by encouraging productive and active ageing
through providing support for capacity building of government/
NGOs/PRIs/ local bodies and the community at large. Under the scheme,
financial assistance up to 90% of the project cost is provided to NGOs for
establishing and maintaining old age homes, day care centres and mobile
medicare units. The scheme has been made flexible so as to meet the diverse
needs of older persons including reinforcement and strengthening of the
family, awareness generation on issues pertaining to older persons, popular-
ization of the concept of lifelong preparation for old age, facilitating
productive ageing, etc. </p>
<p>
The scheme has been revised from April 2008. Besides increase in
amount of financial assistance for existing projects, several innovative projects
have been added as being eligible for assistance under the scheme. Some of
these are: </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000146">146</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:146 </h1>
<p>
0 Maintenance of Respite Care Homes and Continuous Care Homes;
0 Running of Day Care Centres for Alzheimer’s disease/ Dementia
  patients;
0 Physiotherapy clinics for older persons;
0 Helplines and counselling centres for older persons;
0 Sensitizing programmes for children particularly in schools and
  colleges;
0 Regional Resource and Training Centres for caregivers to the older
  persons;
0  Awareness Generation Programmes for older persons and caregivers;
   Formation of Senior Citizens Associations etc.</p>
 <p>
   During 2007-08, the government has spent more than Rs 16 crore for
assisting 660 such programmes around the country which covered around
fifty thousand beneficiaries. </p>
<p>
    Apart from the above, various central ministries such as Health &
Family Welfare, Rural Development, Railways, Finance, Civil Aviation,
Pensions and Pensioner Grievances, etc., have also launched their own
Schemes for the benefit of their retired employees. For example, while Indian
Railways provides a discount of 40 per cent and 50 per cent to male (60+) and
female(58 +) senior citizens respectively, the national carrier, Air India,
provides concession up to 50 per cent for male senior citizens of 65 years and
above, and female senior citizens of 63 years and above.  </p>
<p>
   To conclude, the implications of the ageing for India are many and
far-reaching. The numbers are increasing, the resources are limited and the
priorities lie elsewhere. Hence, the response to this social problem has to be
Well-orchestrated, multi-sectoral and based on systematic planning. The first
step is advocacy, to raise policy makers’ awareness of the multiple issues related
to the ageing in the country. Professionals, politicians, voluntary workers,
NGOs and the general public should come forward for this worthy cause.  </p>

                      <h1> Elder Abuse </h1>
<p>
Elder abuse is recognized as a continually increasing and serious problem in
our society. According to World Health Organization (WHO), it is a
violation of human rights and is a significant cause of illness, injury, loss of
productivity, isolation and despair. Each year, hundreds of thousands of
adults over the age of 60 are abused, neglected or financially exploited. In India
alone, a majority of older adults are believed to be abused or neglected at
various levels. These statistics are likely an underestimate because most of the
victims are unable or afraid to tell the police, family or friends about the
violence. In other parts of the world too elder abuse occurs with little  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000147">147</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:147 </h1>
<p>
 recognition or response. Until recently, this serious social problem was
hidden from the public view and considered mostly a private matter. Though
it exists in both developing and developed countries yet it is typically
underreported globally. Thus, even today, elder abuse continues to be a taboo,
mostly underestimated and ignored by societies across the world. Despite this,
its social and moral significance is obvious. As such, it demands a global multi-
faceted response, one which focuses on protecting the rights of older persons. </p>

<h1> Definitions </h1>
<p>
Like ageing, there is no consistent definition of elder abuse. It is generally
defined either in a poor or imprecise way, or specifically to reflect the unique
statutes or conditions present in specific locations (e.g., states, counties or
cities), or for research purposes. As a result, no universally accepted definition
does exist. However, several scholars, including Hudson and Johnson (1986)
from the US and Stones (1991) from Canada, have attempted to define this
phenomenon. The Canadian framework for defining abuse or neglect, for
example, contains 71 items grouped into nine categories such as physical
assault, excessive restraint, putting health at risk, failure to give care by
someone acting as a paid or unpaid caretaker under pressure, humiliating
behaviour, abuse in an institution, material (including financial) exploitation
and verbal humiliating (Stones, 1995). </p>
<p>
   In fact, the concept of ‘elder abuse and neglect’ was developed in an era
when older people were identified as a homogenous group based on chrono—
logical age, and were marginalized by an understanding of their capacities that
was associated with their exclusion from the labour market and with a
perception that their roles in society were limited and subject to decline
(Neugarten, 1967).</p>
<p>
  Baumann (1989) argues unequivocally that ‘elder abuse and neglect’ was
socially constructed by professional ‘experts’ as part of the development of
gerontology as a discipline. Baumann’s perspective is coincident with that of
Leroux and Petrunik (1990: 653), for whom the idea of ‘elder abuse’ as a social
emerged from the “public perception of old age as a social problem”, where
“old age overrides all other statuses and has the most priority in the character-
ization of the individual”. Based on the perception of old people as frail in
mind and body, there is “an assured need to protect the elderly” through
professional intervention. Moreover, this construction “overrides their status
as legally and socially competent adults.” </p>
<p>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines elder
abuse as any abuse and neglect of persons aged 60 and older by a caregiver or
another person in a relationship involving an expectation of trust. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000148">148</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:148 </h1>
<p>
    According to WHO, elder abuse can be defined as “a single, or repeated
act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where
there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older
person”. It can take various forms such as physical, psychological or
emotional, sexual and financial abuse. </p>
<p>
     In 1987, the American Medical Association’s Council on Scientific
Affairs defined elder abuse as an act or omission that results in harm or
threatened harm to the health or welfare of an elderly person. </p>
<p>
     In brief, it can be stated that a consistent definition is needed to monitor
the incidence and examine trends over time. It can also help determine the
magnitude of the problem and enables comparisons across locations, which
ultimately leads to prevention and intervention efforts. Besides, approaches to
define, detect and address elder abuse need to be placed within a cultural
context and considered along side culturally specific risk factors. For example,
in some traditional societies, older widows are subjected to forced marriages
while in others, isolated older women are accused of witchcraft. Similarly,
from a health and social perspectives, unless both primary health care and
social service sectors are well equipped to identify and deal with the problem,
elder abuse will continue to be underdiagnosed and overlooked. </p>
<h1>  Forms </h1>
<p>
There are six types of maltreatment that occur among people over the age of
60.These include: </p>
<p>
0 Physical abuse occurs when an elder is injured (e.g., scratched, bitten,
  slapped, pushed, hit, burned, etc.), assaulted or threatened with a
  weapon (e.g., knife, gun, or other object), or inappropriately
  restrained.
0 Sexual abuse or abusive sexual contact is any sexual contact against an
  elder’s will. This includes acts in which the elder is unable to under-
  stand the act or is unable to communicate. Abusive sexual contact is
  defined as intentional touching (either directly or through the
  clothing), of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, mouth, inner thigh, or
  buttocks.
0 Psychological or emotional abuse occurs when an elder experiences
  Examples include humiliation or embarrassment; controlling
  behaviour (e.g., prohibiting or limiting access to transportation,
  telephone, money or other resources); social isolation; disregarding
  or trivializing needs; or damaging or destroying property. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000149">149</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:149 </h1>
<p>
0 Neglect is the failure or refusal of a caregiver or other responsible
person to provide for an elder’s basic physical, emotional, or social
needs, or failure to protect them from harm. Examples include not
providing adequate nutrition, hygiene, clothing, shelter, or access to
necessary health care; or failure to prevent exposure to unsafe activities
and environments. Some scholars have also added self neglect to it.

0 Abandonment is the wilful desertion of an elderly person by caregiver
or other responsible person.

0 Financial abuse or exploitation is the unauthorized or improper use of
the resources of an elder for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or
gain. Examples include forgery, misuse or theft of money or posses-
sions; use of coercion or deception to surrender finances or property;
or improper use of guardianship or power of attorney. </p>

<h1> Indian Scenario </h1>
<p>
India has an estimated 98 million senior citizens today and their number is
expected to increase to 315 million by 2050.  </p>
<p>
    Currently, there are no official statistics available relating to the preva-
lence of elder abuse in the country. However, it is said that one in three
elderly persons is neglected or ill-treated by close relatives. In a recent
HelpAge India survey report (2013) too, it was revealed that the main prepe-
trator comes from within one’s family as more than one-fifth (23%) of elderly
across the country experienced abuse at home. Another finding that came was
that both daughter-in—laws and sons were the primary perpetrators of abuse,
with just a negligible difference (39% and 38% respectively) (Hindustan Times,
15 June 2013). This finding is in contradiction to the general belief that in
most of the cases of elder abuse the perpetrators are male. </p>
<p>
In 2012, the HelpAge India also conducted a similar survey in 20 cities
across the country. Here, we present the main findings of the report: </p>
<p>
0 31 per cent of older persons reported facing abuse.
0 More than half of those abused were facing it for more than four
 years and all these were facing multiple forms of abuse.
0 24 per cent older people faced abuse almost daily.
0 75 per cent of those who faced abuse lived with family and 69 per cent
  were owners of the house in which they were living.
0 The primary abuser was the son in 56 per cent cases, followed by the
 daughter-in-law with 23 per cent cases.
0 More than 50 per cent of those abused, had faced this situation for
  more than 5 years. 33 per cent faced it for up to three years and less
  than 1 per cent faced it for more than six years. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000150">150</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: 150 </h1>
<p>
0 55 per cent of those abused, did not report it to anyone. More that 80
per cent of these did not report the matter to uphold family honour.

0 62 per cent older persons suggested the most effective mechanisms to
tackle elder abuse was sensitization of children and strengthening of
intergenerational bonding and 38 per cent stated it to be economic
independence.

0 18 per cent older persons did not know about any of the currently
available redress mechanism whereas 36 per cent knew about one and
46 per cent knew two or three of the options.

0 The older persons considered disrespect, neglect and verbal abuse as
elder abuse.

0 Disrespect, followed by neglect and verbal abuse, were thought to be
the form in which elder abuse was most prevalent in our society.

0 6 per cent older persons did not know what constitutes elder abuse.

0 81 per cent older persons thought that elder abuse was prevalent in
our society.

0 Only 22 per cent older persons considered the prevalence rate of elder
abuse in society to be high; an equal proportion considered it to be
low and 56 per cent said it was moderate.

0 Most of the abused older persons experienced disrespect, neglect and
verbal abuse.

0 Little less than 50 per cent of the older persons had seen cases of elder
abuse in their surroundings.

0 Out of those who reported abuse, 49 per cent elders chose a family
member for reporting/ confiding about it.

0 Police helplines and services were known to majority of the respon-
dents but were never used, probably due to lack of trust or to
maintain family honour.

0 Delhi NCR witnessed a rise in abuse from last year, with 29.82 per
cent elderly sating they faced abuse, as against 12 per cent the year
before. Mumbai (Maharashtra) followed a close second to Delhi NCR
with 29.46 per cent.

0 Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) ranked the highest in elder abuse with
77.12 per cent elders stating they faced abuse, followed closely by
Guwahati (Assam) with 60.55 per cent and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh)
with 52 per cent.

0 Other than Bhubaneswar (Odisha) with 23.31 per cent, eastern India
on an overall basis had high percentage of elder abuse with Guwahati
(Assam) 60.55 per cent and Kolkata (West Bengal) 40.93 per cent. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000151">151</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:151 </h1>
<p>
0 11 per cent of older women and 6 per cent older men did not have any
knowledge about the currently available reporting and redress mecha-
nisms. None of the respondents knew about all the available
mechanisms. </p>
<p>
0 19 per cent older women knew abut one mechanism as compared to
17 per cent men, and 21 per cent women knew two or three mecha-
nisms as compared to 25 per cent older men.

<h1> Preventive Measures, page no:152 </h1>
<p>
  15 June marks the officially recognized “United Nations World Elder Abuse
Awareness Day”. Millions of people around the world organize events to raise
awareness about this global injustice. Richard Blewitt, HelpAge CEO said,
"Our rights do not change as we grow older. Sadly, what does change is that
older women and men are considered to be inherently less valuable to society.”  </p>
<p>
   As said at the outset, elder abuse spans a broad spectrum. It ranges from
physical violence to the neglect of elders, who depend on others for their basic
needs. There has always been lack of attention on the part of governments
towards this social problem. Actually, older people’s rights are protected under
international human rights law, but as the existing commitments are not
enshrined in human rights treaties, governments have no legal obligation to
implement them. Most governments do not see older people as rights holders
with responsibilities, but only as recipients of welfare. This attitude needs to be
changed. A new UN convention on the rights of older people is necessary to
bring about this change. It would provide governments with a legal framework,
guidance and support to help them protect older people’s rights.  </p>
<p>
   Although little is known about elder abuse in India, the existing liter-
ature and accounts by Indian elders and their families suggest that it is a
serious and pervasive problem. Over the past few years, both central and state
governments across the country have crafted policies and programmes,
besides enacting laws, to stop abuse, treat its effects and prevent its recurrence.
These have already been discussed above in section on ‘Ageing’. Besides, the
civil society can play a crucial role in prevention of elder abuse from the
society. The example of HelpAge is a classic example which is working all
over the world for this human cause. </p>
<p>
   At the most basic level, greater importance must be attached to primary
prevention. This requires building a society in which older people are allowed
to live out their lives in dignity, adequately provided with the necessities of
life and with genuine opportunities for self- fulfillment. For those societies
overwhelmed by poverty, the challenge is enormous. Prevention starts with
awareness. One important way to raise awareness—both among the public
and concerned professionals—is through education and training. Those
providing health care and social services at all levels, both in the community
and in institutional settings, should receive basic training on the detection of
elder abuse. The media are a second powerful tool for raising awareness of the
problem and its possible solutions, among the public as well as the authorities. </p>
<p>
  Programmes, in which older people themselves play a leading role in
preventing abuse in their homes, include:  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000153">153</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:153 </h1>
<p>
0 recruiting and training older people to serve as visitors or
companions to other older people who are isolated;

0 creating support groups for victims of elder abuse;

0 setting up community programmes to stimulate social interaction
and participation among the elderly;

0 building social networks of older people in villages, neighbourhoods
or housing units; and

0 working with older people to create “self-help” programmes that
enable them to be productive.

0 Preventing elder abuse by helping abusers, particularly adult
children, to resolve their own problems is a difficult task. Measures
that may be useful include:

0 offering services for the treatment of mental health problems and
substance abuse;

0 making jobs and education available; and

0 finding new ways of resolving conflict, especially where the tradi-
tional role of older people in conflict resolution has been eroded.
0 Much can also be done to prevent abuse of the elderly in institutional
settings. Measures that may be useful include:

0 The development and implementation of comprehensive care plans;

and

0 the development of policies and programmes to improve the physical
and social environment of the institution. </p>
<p>
      We conclude this chapter in the words of J. Randal and T. German: “The
problems of ageing and elder abuse cannot be solved if the essential needs of
older persons, viz., food, shelter, security and access to health care, are not met.
The nations all over the world must create such an environment in which
ageing is accepted as a natural part of one’s life cycle, where anti-ageing attitudes
are discouraged, where older people are given the right to live with
dignity—free of abuse and exploitation—and are given opportunities to partic-
ipate fully in educational, cultural, spiritual and economic activities” (1999). </p>

Communalism, Secularism and
Regionalization

</h1>

<h1>
Communalism
</h1>
<p>
The rising trend of communalism and the accompanying violence have
created a feeling of insecurity among the religious minorities and ethnic
groups. This may just be a fear, but the nation cannot afford to let about
one-sixth of the country’s population to fall victim to panic, suspicion and
insecurity. The events between 1984 and 2002 in different parts of the country
give ample evidence and taste of the destructive outcome of the communal
virus in its varied forms. Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities in
India are protected by the Constitution which provides for the existence of
perfect justice, tolerance, equality and freedom. But in an age in which
religious fundamentalism is on the verge of becoming religious bigotry, intol-
erance and narrow mindedness, the notion of ‘Ram Rajya’ is misinterpreted
by Muslims to mean the rule of the Lord Ram, i.e., Hindu rule. The presence
of police near the gurudwaras to keep an eye on and to check the hide-outs of
terrorists in the religious shrines (as in Amritsar in 1985 and in Kashmir in
November 1993 and May 1995) is viewed as interference in religious faith.
Therefore, to prevent damage to the peace and integrity of the nation, there is
a need to analyse and debate on the problem of communalism and communal
violence. It has become absolutely important to define ‘communalism’ today.
Also, it is equally pertinent to discover who is ‘communal’. </p>
<p>
If a Hindu declares with pride that he is a Hindu, does it amount to
communalism? If a Muslim says, he is proud of being a Muslim and would </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000158">158</pagenum>
<h1> page no:158 </h1>
<p>
give his life to stay a good Muslim, would that be communalism? When a
minority community feels (rightly or wrongly) that it has been suppressed by
decades of injustice and is being exploited and deprived, and reacts and
protests sharply, sometimes even violently, can this be called communalism?
If the Christians, the Buddhists and the Parsis lead their personal and private
lives in the way they like, according to their own beliefs and creeds, are they
communal? Do those Hindus, who accuse Muslims of hurting their religious
sentiments and sensibilities by a variety of acts of omission and commission,
be permitted to feel that they are above public accountability by dint of sheer
superiority in numbers when they themselves commit the same sin of hurting
Muslims’ sentiments and faith in a systematic fashion? Can those people who
fight over one particular place of worship and neglect thousands of temples,
mosques, churches, gurudwaras and similar holy places, which are crumbling
because of lack of repair and maintenance, be called religious leaders? Is a
religious leader bigger than the nation? Should the religious leaders be
exempted from the definition of communalism? All these factors compel us to
precisely define ‘communal’ and ‘communalism’. </p>

<h1> Concept of Communalism </h1>
<p>
Communalism is an ideology which states that society is divided into religious
communities whose interests differ and are, at times, even opposed to each
other. The antagonism practised by the people of one community against the
people of other community and religion can be termed ‘communalism’. This
antagonism goes to the extent of falsely accusing, harming and deliberately
insulting a particular community and extends to looting, burning down the
homes and shops of the helpless and the weak, dishonouring women, and
even killing persons. </p>
<p>
   ‘Communal persons’ are those who practise politics through religion.
Among leaders, those religious leaders are ‘communal’ who run their religious
communities like business enterprises and institutions which raise the cries of
"Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism or Christianity in danger”, the moment they find
that donations into their holy ‘corporations’ have begin to dwindle, or their
leadership has come to be challenged, or their ideology has been questioned.
Thus, 'communal’ is not one who is “a man of religion” but “one who
practices politics by linking it with religion." These power politicians are not
good Hindus nor good Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis or Buddhists. They
can be viewed as dangerous political ‘scum’. For them, God and religion are
merely instruments to be used to live luxuriously as the ‘king parasites’ of
society and to attain the political goals (Day After, June, 1990:35—36).</p>
<p>
   Communalism can be practised in many ways; for example, as political
communalism, religious communalism and economic communalism. Political </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000159">159</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:159 </h1>
<p>
communalism is the product of abiding or lasting political expediency and
developing and conserving vote bank, and in which covering up one’s wrongs
and, at the same time, diverting the attention of the people by a series of 'lid
off’ exercises to pass the ‘communal buck’ and shift the blame on one’s rivals
constitute the familiar game plan. In this political game plan, leaders
invariably say what they do not mean and mean what they do not say. </p>
<p>
    Oommen (1989) has suggested six dimensions of communalism:
assimilationist, welfarist, retreatist, retaliatory, separatist, and secessionist.
Assimilationist communalism is one in which small religious groups are assimi
lated/ integrated into a big religious group. Such communalism claims that
Scheduled Tribes (STs) are Hindus, or that Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists are
Hindus and they should be covered by the Hindu Marriage Act. Welfarist
communalism aims at the welfare of a particular community, say, improving
living standard and providing for education and health of Christians by the
Christian associations, or Parsi associations working for the uplift of the
Parsis. Such communal mobilization aims at working only for the members
of one ’s own community. Retreatist communalism is one in which a small
religious community keeps itself away from politics; for example, Bahai
community, which proscribes its members from participating in political
activities. Retaliatory communalism attempts to harm, hurt, injure the
members of other religious communities. Separatist communalism is one in
which one religious or a cultural group wants to maintain its cultural speci-
ficity and demands a separate territorial state within the country, for example,
the demand of some Bodos in Assam or of Gorkhas for Gorkhaland in West
Bengal, or of Vidarbha in Maharashtra. Lastly, secessionist communalism is one
in which a religious community wants a separate political identity, and
demands an independent state. A very small militant section of Sikh
population demanding Khalistan or some Muslim militants demanding Azad
Kashmir were engaged in practising this type of communalism. Of these six
types of communalism, the last three create problems engendering agitations,
communal riots, terrorism and insurgency. </p>

 <h1>   Communalism in India </h1>
<p>
The pluralistic society of India is composed not only of religious groups such
as Hindus (80.50%), Muslims (13.40%), Christians (2.30%), Sikhs (1.90%),
Buddhists (0.80%), Jains (0.40%), and so on (Census of India, 2011), but these
groups are further divided into various sub-groups. Hindus are divided into
sects like Arya Samajis, Shivites, Sanatanis and Vaishnavas, while Muslims are
divided into Shias and Sunnis on the one hand, and Ashrafs (aristocrats),
Azlafs (weavers, butchers, carpenters, oilmen) and Arzals, on the other. The </p>

<p>
strained relations between Hindus and Muslims have existed for a long time,
whereas some Hindus and Sikhs have also started viewing each other with
suspicion, particularly after the Operation Blue Star and assassination of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the resultant anti-Sikh riots in Delhi in
1984. We also hear of some conflicts between Hindus and Christians and
Muslims and Christians too but, by and large, Christians in India do not feel
deprived or exploited by other communities. Among Muslims, Shias and
Sunnis too bear prejudicial attitudes towards each other. Here, we will mainly
analyse Hindu-Muslim and briefly Hindu-Sikh relations. </p>

<h1> Hindu-Muslim Relations </h1>
<p>
Muslim attacks on India started from the 10th century, but early Muslim
conquerors like Mohammad Ghazni and Mohammad Gori were more inter-
ested in looting rather than establishing religious dominance. It was when
Qutubdin became the first Sultan of Delhi that Islam found a footing in India.
Later, it was the Moghuls who consolidated their empire and Islam in the
process. Some of the policies, proselytization efforts, destruction of Hindu
temples and construction of mosques over these temples by Moghul rulers
aroused communal bickerings between Hindu and Muslim communities.
When the British established their dominance in India via the East India
company, they initially adopted the policy of patronizing Hindus, but after
the First War of Independence in 1857 in which Hindus and Muslims fought
shoulder to shoulder, the Britishers adopted the policy of “divide and rule”
which resulted in fostering communal clashes deliberately for keeping intact
their hegemony. The relations between Hindus and Muslims were further
strained when during the freedom struggle, power politics came into play.
Thus, though antagonism between Hindus and Muslims is an old issue,
Hindu-Muslim relations in India can be described as a legacy of British rule
during the freedom struggle. The communalism between these two
communities operates today in a significantly changed social and political
milieu. It is now perceived as a problem that impedes and warps the process of
development of our country. It is the single largest threat to the secular ideals
that are enshrined in our Constitution. The sectarian interests keep on
fanning the flames of communal hatred. </p>
<p>
   Let us examine the genesis and historical roots of Hindu-Muslim
communalism after the Second World War in order to provide some under-
standing of this phenomenon in its contemporary context. What were the
religious and political ideologies and aspirations of the political parties that
participated in the freedom struggle? Given the diversity of Indian society, the
nationalist movement had to accommodate the interests of all  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000161">161</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:161 </h1>
<p>
groups—economic, linguistic and religious. The nationalist appeal was to
address itself to two important factors to unite the diverse groups: first,
freedom from the exploitation of colonial rulers, and second, democratic
rights for all citizens. Did major political parties such as the Congress, the
Muslim League, the Communist Party and the Hindu Maha Sabha share these
sentiments in thirties and forties of the 20th century? Perhaps not. What was
the policy of the Congress towards communalism and communal parties?
According to Bipan Chandra (1984), the Congress from its very inception
adopted a policy of “unity from the top” in which the effort was to win over
the middle class and upper class Muslims who were accepted as leaders of the
Muslim community, leaving it to them to draw the Muslim masses into the
movement, instead of making a direct appeal to the anti-imperialist sentiments
of both the Hindu and the Muslim masses. This approach could not promote
Hindu-Muslim cooperation in fighting imperialism. The Khilafat movement
launched by the Muslim League against the British interference in Turkey
hinged on a religious issue. The Congress only extended its support to this
movement. All the serious efforts between 1918 and 1922 at bringing about
Hindu-Muslim unity were in the nature of negotiations among the top leaders
of the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities and the Congress. Quite often,
the Congress acted as an intermediary among the different communal leaders
instead of acting as an active organizer of the forces of secular nationalism.
There was, thus, an implicit acceptance within the early nationalist leadership
that Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were distinct communities which shared
only the political and the economic concerns but not the religious, social and
cultural practices. This is how seeds of communalism were sown in the first
and second quarters of the 20th century. However, the Muslim League and
the Hindu Maha Sabha remained fairly weak organizationally till 1936. In that
1937 elections, the Muslim League won only 22 per cent of the total (482) seats
reserved for Muslims in the provincial assemblies. It did not fare well even in
the Muslim-majority provinces. It was only after 1942 that the Muslim League
emerged as a strong political party and claimed the right to speak for all
Muslims. M.A. Jinnah described the Congress as a ‘Hindu’ organization—a
claim that the British also supported. Within the Congress itself, some leaders
like Madan Mohan Malaviya, K.M. Munshi and Sardar Patel took up
pro-Hindu positions. Thus, the Congress could not purge its ranks of
communal elements. </p>
<p>
The slogan of Pakistan was first articulated by the Muslim League in
Lahore in 1940. Different sections of the Muslim population had different
perceptions of Pakistan. For the Muslim peasant, it meant freedom from the
exploitation of the Hindu zamindar; for the Muslim business class, it meant </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000162">162</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:162 </h1>
<p>
freedom from a well-established Hindu business network; and for the Muslim
intelligentsia, it meant better employment opportunities. Later, when the
Congress leaders accepted the partition in 1946, it led in 1947 to the
displacement of millions of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs amid bloodshed and
carnage. About 2 lakh persons were estimated to have been killed in the 1947
partition riots and about 6 million Muslims and four and a half million Hindus
and Sikhs became refugees. Even after the partition, the Congress failed to come
to grips with communalism. It could, therefore, be said that Hindu-Muslim
communalism in India had politico—social origins, and religion alone was not
the cause of the conflict between Hindus and Muslims. Economic interests and
cultural and social mores (such as festivals, social practices and lifestyles) were
factors that further divided the two communities. </p>
<p>
     Today, the Muslims constitute the second largest religious community
in India as well as the second largest Muslim minority in the world. Approxi—
mately, more than 138 million Muslims are spread out over all parts of our
country, and the ratio of Muslim population over Hindu population exceeds
the national average (1:6) in some states like Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and
West Bengal. India’s Muslims are as varied in language, culture and
socio—economic conditions as the Hindus. There is little in common between
the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh and the Muslims in Kerala or in Assam or in
Jammu & Kashmir. Their unifying factor is religion but the fact is that they
do not even have a common language. Though about 13.4 per cent of Indians
are  Muslims, not even half of them speak Urdu, and all those who speak Urdu
are not Muslims. </p>
<p>
     A closer look reveals that the 16 cities which are more vulnerable to
Hindu—Muslim communal riots are Moradabad, Meerut, Aligarh, Agra and
Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh; Aurangabad in Maharashtra; Ahmedabad in
Gujarat; Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, Jamshedpur and Patna in Bihar;
Silchar and Guwahati in Assam; Kolkata in West Bengal; Bhopal in Madhya
pradesh; Srinagar in Jammu & Kashmir; and Cuttack in Orrisa. Of these
cities, 11 lie in the northern belt of India, three in the eastern belt and two in
Esauthern belt. Except in Jammu & Kashmir and Lakshadweep which are
predominantly populated by Muslim citizens, the proportion of Muslim
concentration is sizeable in states like Assam (30.90%), West Bengal (25.20%),
Kerala (24.70%), Uttar Pradesh (18.50%) and Bihar (16.50%) (Census of India,
2011). Could it be presumed that the Muslims in South India are culturally
better assimilated because of their involvement in trade and commerce which
calls for goodwill with all the communities? But this is true in the case of five
towns in Uttar Pradesh also. We have, therefore, to search another expla-
nation for this phenomenon. </p>

<p>
The Hindu-Muslim antagonism can be ascribed to a complex set of
factors: These are: (1) Muslim invasions in which the invaders looted the
property and constructed mosques over/ near Hindu temples. (2) British
encouragement of Muslim separatism for their own ends during their imperial
rule. (3) The behaviour of some of the Muslims in India after partition, like
hoisting of Pakistani flags when the Pakistani team wins the cricket match and
or observing national independence day as a ‘black day’ after a call given by
some Muslim leaders. Such behaviour creates a feeling among the majority
community that these Muslims are not patriotic. The stereotyped image of a
Muslim which is entrenched in the Indian psyche is that of a bigoted,
inward-looking outcaste. A Muslim similarly looks upon a Hindu as a
conniving, all-powerful opportunist and he views himself as victimized by
him and alienated from the mainstream of society. (4) A new aggressiveness
on the part of the Muslim political parties in an effort to find a place in the
country. Reports are rife about some Muslim extremists obtaining ‘foreign
money’, turning into ‘foreign agents’, indulging in a well-designed plan to soil
the secular ideal of the country, and attempting to incite Indian Muslims. (5)
A failure on the part of Muslim leaders to unite Muslims and resolve their
problems is perhaps due to frustrations because they have been influenced by
the wave of Islamic fundamentalism sweeping West Asia and Pakistan. The
leaders have only exploited the numerical strength of the Muslims (especially
in Kerala, Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh) to strike barter deals, secure a chunk of
Muslim seats in the parliament and legislatures and to seek power and pelf for
themselves and their friends. (6) The government is also responsible for
neglecting the Muslims, large sections of whom feel alienated and conse
quently become willing victims of selfish leaders. The ruling elite merely
preach religious amity and have little understanding of the real problems of
the Muslims. The Hindu leadership only deals with those Muslim leaders who
toe their line. </p>
<p>
The Indian Muslims, not surprisingly, tend to consider their future as a
question of ‘Us’ versus ‘They’. When they make their demands known, as
any segment of society would do to voice their grievances, it more often than
not explodes into an orgy of Hindu-Muslim violence which leads to
accusation of foreign incitement. Should the Muslim problem be perceived
only as a communal problem? Is it not a fact that the Hindu-Muslim issue is
not any different from the anti-Brahmin agitations in Tamil Nadu or the
inter-caste conflicts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and some other states, or the
Bengali— Assamese trouble in Assam, or the Maharashtrian versus
non-Maharashtrian conflict in Maharashtra? The problem in reality is one of
social and economic change. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000164">164</pagenum>
<h1> page no:164 </h1>
<p>
    The militant Hindus maintain that the Muslims in the country are being
pampered. The Ramjanma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid issue in 1992—93 further
affected the delicate balance of communal harmony. After getting disillu-
sioned with in the Congress (I), the Muslims developed faith in parties like
Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the United Front. The
Muslims today feel far more concerned about their safety and security. </p>

<h1> Hindu-Sikh Communalism </h1>
<p>
    The Sikhs constitute less than 2 per cent (1.9 crore) of India’s population.
Though dispersed widely over the entire country and even abroad, their
largest concentration is in Punjab, where they form the majority of the state’s
population. Sikhism started as a reform movement against the dogmas of
Hindu religion. After the tenth guru, the tradition of gurus among Sikhs
ended and the Granth Sahib was accorded utmost reverence. The Sikh shrines
(gurudwaras) remained under the control of priests, some of whom misused
their position and amassed personal wealth. In the early years of the 20th
century, some young Sikhs started a movement against the hegemony of the
Sikh mahants. These people—called Akalis—wanted shrines to be managed by
a body of democratically elected representatives. The Shiromani Gurudwara
Prabhandak Committee (SGPC), thus, came into existence in 1925 after the
Sikhs waged a hard struggle to liberate their gurudwaras from the corrupt
mahants. Since its inception, the SGPC has been a seat of great power. Its
president has always played a major role in Sikh affairs. At one time he was
even described as a maker or demolisher of the Chief Minister of Punjab. Few
Akali elite survived without his support. </p>
<p>
     Another group (sect) called the Nirankaris started a movement against
the dogmas, rituals and traditions which had crept into Sikhism. Thus, the
Nirankari movement was a reformist movement (purely religious in
character) against the induction of Hindu religious practices in the Sikh
system of worship. It emphasized the elimination of the worship of several
deities and revived simplicity, austerity and purity in rituals and ceremonies.
The Nirankaris remained within the Sikh fold till 1943 after which there arose
conflict. In 1973, the undivided Akali Dal under the leadership of Master Tara
Singh demanded ‘autonomous status’ for Punjab dominated by Sikhs. On 17
October, 1973, the Akalis passed a resolution, now popularly called the
'Anandpur Sahib Resolution’, in which they made 45 demands. Later, the
Akalis came to be divided into extremists and moderates. One militant group
led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale emerged as a powerful group in the early
eighties of the 20th century. Initially, he launched a movement against the
Nirankaris to purify the Sikh religion but ultimately he started a Sikh </p>

<p>
separatist movement and began a demand for Khalistan. Though a small
section of Sikhs continues to work for this demand, the majority of the Akalis
are for a state in which the authority of the Centre is to be confined to
defence, foreign relations, communications, railways and currency. </p>
<p>
   The Sikh agitation, which started in Punjab in the early eighties with the
murder of a local editor, hijacking of a Srinagar-bound flight, and the issuing of
passports for a fictitious nation called Khalistan, began to intensify. The
number of killings and firings increased and the Sikh protests became
organized, militant and increasingly violent. In 1984, when the military
launched Operation Blue Star for seizing weapons and arresting militants from
the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the Sikhs reacted violently. In October 1984,
when Indira Gandhi was assassinated and thousands of Sikhs were killed in
Delhi and other states, and their property was looted, burnt or destroyed, some
Sikh militants became so agitated that they killed hundreds of Hindus in trains
and buses, destroyed their property and forced many Hindus to leave Punjab.
In May 1988, when Operation Black Thunder was launched once again by the
military to clear militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar which
remained under their seize for about ten days, the Sikhs retaliated by exploding
bombs, killing Hindus and looting banks. The relations between Sikhs and
Hindus thus remained strained for about one and a half decade. However, the
militancy of extremist Sikhs in Punjab has now been suppressed and from 1993
onwards, there has been considerable improvement in the relations between the
people of the two communities. There is goodwill and respect among them for
each other’s religious beliefs and places of worship. </p>

<h1> Ethnic Violence </h1>
<p>
Besides the Hindu-Muslim conflicts and Hindu-Sikh skirmishes, how do we
perceive the relations between different ethnic groups, say between the
Sinhalese and the Tamils, or between the Assamese and the non-Assamese? In
Assam, for nearly a century and a half, the economic development of the state
was fuelled by the labour and enterprise imported from outside the state. Over
this period, Assam has been home to generations of the so-called ‘outsiders',
who have no home, no land other than the soil of Assam itself. Some have
indeed grown rich, but most have remained desperately poor. The Assamese
have now raised the question of nationality. The All Assam Students’ Union
(AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AGSP) agitation (which
fathered the AGP as a political party) confused ‘outsiders’ with ‘foreigners’
(including Bengali refugees from the Bangladesh). Fantastic figures were
brandished ranging from five million at one stage, six million at another and
then seven million at yet another stage as the number of foreigners (bahiragat) </p>

<p>
illegitimately lurking in the state. This issue of ridding Assam of foreigners held
the state to ransom for six years—from 1979 till the Assam accord on 15 August
1985. Hatred was stoked up against the Bodos, the Bengalis, the Marwaris and
the non-Assam Muslims. This secessionist movement was responsible for
thousands of innocent deaths. The massacre of 1,383 women and children and
some men in ten villages in and around Nellie in Nowgong district was a part of
this ethnic violence. The AGSP which remained in power between 1985 and
1990 could not contain the ethnic tension. </p>
<p>
    The ULFA militants launched a movement and the President’s rule was
imposed in the state in November 1990 instead of holding elections due in
January 1991. The army and the security forces launched an operation to
round up the rebels and recover weapons. The President’s rule was lifted on
30 June 1991 when the new Congress government assumed power in the state.
But, the ULFA militants jolted new government by kidnapping 14
government servants including eight top ONGC officials from different parts
of the state on the very first day of government’s tenure. The May 1996
elections have also not prevented the reprisals from the Bodos. The militants
are yet to realize that Assam is like all other states in India, and it belongs to all
the legitimate citizens of India, whatever language they speak, whatever
religion they follow and whatever rites and rituals they practise. The Bodos—a
tribe which comprised about 49 per cent of Assam’s population in 1947 and
about 5.5 per cent in 2011 and which ruled over Assam until around 1825—are
now demanding autonomy. Though an accord was signed by the Assam
government and the Bodo leadership represented by the All Bodo Students
Union (ABSU) and the Bodo People’s Action Committee (BPAC) on
February 20, 1993 but the problem still remains unresolved. Later, in
February 2003, another accord was signed with provision of Bodoland Auton—
omous Council (BAC), but the Bodo leaders and the state government have
failed to arrive at an agreement on the boundary issue and transfer of about
3000 villages to the BAC. The Bodos also do not want that Assamese
language should be thrust upon indigenous tribals. The Bodo movement in
the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s took place in fits and starts but today it has
gathered momentum. Bodos now demand a union territory called
'Udayachal'. Violent activities like bomb blast of Brahmputra Mail in Assam
on december 30,1996 (in which 32 persons were killed and 49 injured) and
blowing up of the road and railway bridges by the Bodo militants in lower
Assam in the last week of December 1996 point out the domestic and ‘foreign’
aid to militants and the need for firm action by the government to contain
insurgent activities. </p>

<p>
   The Bodo militants in their attack on non-Bodo settlers indulged in an
ethnic carnage against the Santhal tribals in May 1996. The violence had
erupted when a Santhal congress leader was killed during the April 1996 polls
to the Assam Legislative Assembly by some insurgents and in retaliation, the
Santhals killed three Bodo girls. This infuriated the Bodos who burned down
several Santhal villages. The death toll was reported to be upwards of 50.One
view is that a month prior to the April polls, some Congress candidates in
Assam had brought Santhal extremists from Jharkhand in Bihar who had
begun attacks on those Bodos who supported PDFB (Peoples Democratic
Front of Bodoland) candidates. The Bodo leaders had also claimed that the
Congress leaders had brought Santhals from Bihar to neutralize the Bodo
claims for statehood. These Santhal tribals had started encroaching upon the
Bodo agricultural lands. After the violent attacks of Bodos on Santhals, over
one lakh Santhals and Bodos are reported to have vacated the villages in two
districts. The government had to open 16 relief camps to look after these
refugees of the two tribal groups. Thus, the reasons for the violence were
partly political and partly ethnic. </p>
<p>
    How do we explain the caste carnage in various parts of the country
reported almost daily in the mainstream newspapers? Though abolished by
law, caste violence is far from having been overcome in real, daily life. Some
of these incidents of communal violence started because of the tension
between the ‘upper castes’ and the ‘backward castes’ while others started over
land disputes. Also, the orgies of killing and rape, the incidents of assault, look
and arson are in many ways fanned by political leaders for their own ends. </p>
<p>
    Despite the death of the major rebel group Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTEE) leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the ethnic violence in sri
Lanka still rages. On the question of the future of the Tamil majority in the
north-eastern province, the LTTE keeps on fighting with the Sinhalese
government and troops. In 1987, it refused to heed to the intervention of the
IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) and demanded its withdrawal. In the 19th
century, the British had taken more than 10 lakh Tamil labourers from
different parts of Madras (now Chennai) to Sri Lanka promising alluring
terms of employment in the tea and coffee gardens. For over hundred years,
these Tamils laboured for the prosperity of Sri Lanka but in 1948—49, the
Sinhalese government passed stringent citizenship laws which deprived them
of their citizenship. Their representation was reduced to eight seats in the
75—member Sri Lankan parliament. On this issue, discussions continued
between the Tamils and the Sri Lankan government and an agreement was
signed in 1964 by the governments of India and Sri Lanka (known as
Sirimavo-Shastri Pact) which provided that 5,25,000 Tamils would be sent </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000168">168</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:168 </h1>
<p>
back to India and Sri Lanka would confer citizenship on three lakh Tamils
during a period of 15 years. Still there remained one and a half lakh Tamils
without citizenship. After some time, there was a further agreement between
the two governments that each of them would absorb 50,000 of the stateless
Tamils. But since 1976, the Sri Lankan government had been extending the
time limit of 15 years provided in the pact. In 1982, India refused to grant any
further extension. The hostility of the Sinhalese towards the Tamils and the
escalating ethnic violence worsened the situation. Tamils have been claiming
mass killings of the people of their community, burning of their factories,
hotels and shops and atrocities committed by Sinhalese soldiers on them. In
this perspective, the Indo-Sri Lankan accord was signed by the Indian and the
Sri Lankan governments on July 29,1987 and the IPKF was sent to Sri Lanka
to maintain peace in that country. In their efforts to restore peace and help the
Sri Lankan government in the running of hospitals, power houses and
schools, more than 1,100 Indian soldiers and officers were killed and 30,000
were injured. Gradually, however, the new Sri Lankan President asked for the
withdrawal of IPKF from Sri Lanka and all IPKF soldiers were ultimately
withdrawn in 1990. But, the Tamils continue to fight for their rights and the
ethnic violence continues to persist. </p>

                     <h1> Communal Violence </h1>

<h1> The Concept </h1>
<p>
The problems and characteristics of communal violence are different from
those of student agitations, workers’ strikes and peasants’ movements. At the
conceptual level, we have to differentiate between communal violence and
agitations, terrorism and insurgency. This difference has been examined at
seven levels: mass mobilization, degree of violence, degree of cohesion, target
of attack, flare-ups, leadership, and aftermath experiences (Singh, 1993). </p>
<p>
    The mass mobilization in agitations is to register protest and voice griev-
ances and put demands in the form of processions, demonstrations and
gheraos. In communal violence, the involvement of people is mobilized against
another community. The movements here are unpredictable, uncheckable
and carry emotional fury and violent expressions which take the form of
rioting. </p>
<p>
   The degree of violence and the methods of executing violence also vary
in agitations and communal riots. In terrorism, the support of masses is
passive, latent and clandestine. Considering the insurrection impossible, it is a
few active armed terrorist groups who use violence systematically. In insur-
gency, the mass support is mobilized to change a political order as against </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000169">169</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: 169</h1>
<p>
communal violence in which resentment is expressed against the social order.
Insurgency is fought by trained groups whereas people participating in
communal riots are untrained. In insurgency, propaganda among masses is
against a regime but in communal riots, it is against social discrimination,
social neglect and social and religious exploitation. </p>
<p>
The degree of cohesion also varies in communal violence, agitations
terrorism and insurgency. The high degree of cohesion in a communal riot
situation is built around hostility, tensions and polarization of population
while in agitations it is based on rationalization of interest. In terrorism and
insurgency, the cohesion is between activists and the leader; in masses it exists
relatively at a lesser degree. </p>
<p>
    The target of attack in insurgency and terrorism is the government, in
agitations it is the group in power, and in communal violence it is members of
the 'enemy' community. Sometimes, violence in both agitations and
communal riots is exercised against public property in the form of loot and
arson. Anti-social elements are given a free hand to operate in agitations and
communal riots but this is not the case in terrorism and insurgency. The
weapons used against targets in insurgency and terrorism are more modern
and sophisticated than those used in agitations and communal disturbances. </p>
<p>
The flare-ups in communal disturbances are restricted to particular struc-
tures whereas in insurgency and in terrorism, the flare-ups are indefinite and
uncertain. In agitations, flare-ups do not depend on particular structures but
are dependent on perceived deprivations and the organization of people. </p>
<p>
The leadership in terrorism, insurgency, and agitations is easily identi-
fiable but not always so in communal riots. There is no leadership in
communal riots which could control and contain the riot situation. In agita-
tions, terrorism and insurgency on the other hand, actions emanate from
leaders’ decisions who have effective control over the situation. </p>
<p>
Lastly, the aftermath of communal violence is intensified animosity,
prejudice and mutual suspicions of one community against the other. In agita
tions, the human loss is comparatively much less though the loss of property
is sometimes huge. When agitations are settled, the animosity against
government agencies also subsides and the revengeful attitude dies down in
the due course. In terrorism, the victims are mostly innocent. They remain
passive against terrorists and feel more secure in such passive behaviour.
Victims can never think of seeking revenge because of the terrorists'
anonymity and their being armed in an organized way with sophisticated
weapons. In insurgencies, the victims are mostly the members of the security
forces or government servants who help in counter-insurgency measures. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000170">170</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:170 </h1>
<p>
   It could, thus, be said that communal violence is based mainly on hatred,
enemity and revenge. This brings us to the question of features of communal
violence. </p>
<h1> Features of Communal Riots </h1>
<p>
A probe of the major communal riots in the country in the last five decades
has revealed that: (1) Communal riots are more politically motivated than
fuelled by religion. Even the Madan Commission which looked into
communal disturbances in Maharashtra in May 1970 had emphasized that
"the architects and builders of communal tensions are the communalists and a
certain class of politicians—those all-India and local leaders out to seize every
opportunity to strengthen their political positions, enhance their prestige and
enrich their public image by giving a communal colour to every incident and
thereby projecting themselves in the public eye as the champions of the
religion and the rights of their community”. (2) Besides political interests,
economic interests too play a vigorous part in fermenting communal clashes.
(3) communal riots seem to be more common in North India than in South
and East India. (4) The probability of recurrence of communal riots in a town
where communal riots have already taken place once or twice is stronger than
in a town in which riots have never occurred. (5) Most communal riots take
place on the occasion of religious festivals. (6) The use of deadly weapons in
the riots is on the ascendancy. </p>

<h1> Incidents of Communal Riots in India </h1>
<p>
India  is a nation that was born in communal violence as a result of the
countr’s partition. Communal frenzy reached its peak in 1946—48 whereas
the period between 1950 and 1963 may be called the period of communal
peace. Political stability and economic development in the country, no doubt,
contributed to the improvement of the communal situation. According to
Outlook (March 5,2012) there have been 58 major communal riots in 47
places since 1967: 10 in South India, 12 in East, 16 in West and 20 in North
India. Since 1964, Ahmedabad has seen five major riots and Hyderabad four.
The 1990s saw the most riots in the last five decades—23. The 1970s saw seven
riots, the 1980s saw 14 and the 2000s have seen 13 with a total toll of 12,828
(South 597, West 3,426, East 3,581 and North 5,224). </p>
<p>
  If we see the recent statistics as revealed by PRS Legislative Research
(prsindia. org), it was found that during 2005-09, 648 people were killed and
11,278 injured in 4.030 incidents of communal violence in the country. On an
average, 130 people died and 2,220 injured in such violence each year. The
maximum number of incidents occurred in Maharashtra (700), followed by
Madhya Pradesh (666) and Uttar Pradesh (645). However, Uttar Pradesh </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000171">171</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: </h1>
<p>
recorded the highest number of casualties (176), followed by Madhya
(107) and Maharashtra (77). </p>
<p>
According to a government report titled Socio—Economic and:
tional Status of Muslims 1n Maharashtra (2011) released late last .
Maharashtra has had 1,192 communal clashes during the 11—year period-i
1998 to 2008, the highest in the country. The same report details that ’
1908 and 2009 Mumbai had the maximum Hindu-Muslim riots of all
and towns in the state. Throughout the 11-year period, Mah
witnessed 10 per cent 0 23 per cent of the total incidence of communal r1
India. Its share was particularly high, the report says, during 2005—06, w .
per cent of all such incidents took place 1n the state. Maharashtra’ 5 co
Violence figures, according to the report, exceeded Gujarat’ 5, though the
bore the ignominy of witnessing the highest death toll, because of the ..
riots. Between 1998 and 2008, 1,114 people died in 823 communal r1v."
Gujarat, while in Maharashtra 172 lives were lost in 1,192 incidents (Ti
India, April 15, 2011).  </p>

<p>
   All these riots point out the weakening of the communal amity in
almost every corner of the country. But, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 in Delhi
following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her
two Sikh bodyguards and the Gujarat riots of 2002 after the Godhara incident
marked the extent of communal hatred in recent years. In both the riots
hundreds of innocent people were killed and property worth of crores of
rupees destroyed.  </p>
<h1> Causes of Communal Violence </h1>
<p>
Different scholars have approached the problem of communal violence with
different perspectives, attributing different causes and suggesting different
measures to counter it. The Marxist School relates communalism to economic
deprivation and to the class struggle between the haves and the have-nots to
secure a monopoly control of the market forces. Political scientists view it as a
power struggle. Sociologists see it as a phenomenon of social tensions and
relative deprivations. The religious experts perceive it as a diadem of violent
fundamentalists and conformists.  </p>
<p>
The class analysis of communalism requires some attention. The expla-
nation is that the economic, social and political situations in a society
sometimes create such problems and crises for the people that even though
they try to come to grips with these crises, they fail to do so. Without
attempting to grasp the real causes for this failure, they ‘perceive’ the other
community (numerically much stronger than their own) as the cause of their
woes. Communalism is thus a social reality which is generated and reflected in
a distorted way.  </p>
<p>
   After independence, though our government claimed to follow "social-
istic pattern of economy” but 1n practice the economic development
based more on capitalist pattern. In this pattern, on one hand, the devel-
opment has not occurred at a rate where it could solve the problems of
poverty, unemployment and insecurity which could prevent frustration and
unhealthy competition for scarce jobs and other economic opportunities, and
on the other capitalist development has generated prosperity only for certain
social strata leading to sharp and visible inequality and new social strains and
social anxieties. Those who have benefited or have gained, have their expecta-
tions soar even higher. They also feel threatened in their newly gained
prosperity. Their relative prosperity arouses the social jealousy of those who
fail to develop or who decline in power and prestige. The efforts of the
government to solve the problems of the religious minorities arouse intense
resentment among those prosperous sections of the community who are in
numerical majority and who have achieved economic, social and political  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000174">174</pagenum>

<p>
power through manipulations. They feel that any rise in social scale of the
minority community will threaten their social domination. Thus, feelings of
suspicion and hostility on the part of both the communities continuously
prepare the growth of communalism. Particularly, it (communalism) makes a
ready appeal to the urban poor and the rural unemployed whose number has
grown rapidly as a result of lop-sided economic and social development and
large-scale migration to cities. The social anger and frustration of these
rootless and impoverished people often find expression in spontaneous
violence whenever opportunity arises. A communal riot provides a good
opportunity for this. But this economic analysis is not considered objective by
many scholars. </p>
<p>
    Is religion responsible for communalism? There are intellectuals who do
not believe that religion has any role to play in it. Bipan Chandra (1994), for
example, holds that communalism is neither inspired by religion nor is
religion an object of communal politics, even though the communalist bases
his politics on religious differences, uses religious identity as an organizing
principle, and in the mass phases of communalism uses religion to mobilize
masses. The religious difference is used to ‘mask’ non—religious social needs,
aspirations and conflicts. However, religiosity, i.e., “too much religion in
one's life” or the intrusion of religion in to areas other than those of personal
Moreover, religious obscurantism, narrow-mindedness and bigotry in the
name of going back to fundamentals tends to divide people whom life and
history have brought together. In this respect, different religions have
different elements in their structure, rituals and ideological practices which
relate to communalism in different manners. Their analysis and elimination
has to be specific to different religions. </p>
<p>
Some scholars have proposed a multiple-factor approach in which they
give importance to several factors together. Ten major factors have been
identified in the etiology of communalism (Surolia, 1987:62): These are:
social, religious, political, economic, legal, psychological, administrative,
historical, local, and international. The social factors include social traditions,
caste and class ego, inequality and religion-based social stratification; the
religious factors include decline in religious norms and secular values, narrow
and dogmatic religious values, use of religion for political gains and communal
ideology of religious leaders; the political factors include religion-based
politics, religion-dominated political organizations, canvassing in elections
based on religious considerations, political interference, instigation or support
to agitations by politicians for vested interests, political justification of
communal violence and failure of political leadership; the economic factors  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000175">175</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:175 </h1>
<p>
include economic exploitation and discrimination of minority religious
communities, lop-sided economic development, competitive market,
non-expanding economy, displacement and non-absorption of workers and
the influence of gulf money in provoking religious conflicts; the legal factors
include absence of common civil code, special provisions and concessions for
some communities in the Constitution, the special status of certain states
reservation policy, and special laws for different communities; the psychosis
logical factors include social prejudices, stereotyped attitudes, distrust
hostility and apathy against another community, rumour, fear psychosis and
the misinformation/misinterpretation/misrepresentation by mass media; the
administrative factors include lack of coordination between the police and
other administrative units, ill-equipped and ill-trained police personnel, inept
functioning of intelligence agencies, biased policemen, and police excesses and
inaction; the historical factors include alien invasions, damage to religious
institutions, proselytization efforts, divide and rule policy of colonial rulers,
partition trauma, past communal riots, old disputes on land, temples and
mosques; the local factors include religious processions, slogan raising,
rumours, land disputes, local anti-social elements and group rivalries; and the
international factors include training and financial support from other
countries, other countries’ mechanizations to disunite and weaken India and
then support to communal organizations. </p>
<p>
    Against these approaches, we need a holistic approach to understand the
problem of communalism and communal violence. The emphasis of this
approach would be on various factors distinguishing the major from the
minor. Like Cyril Burt (1944), we can classify these factors in four sub-groups
most conspicuous, chief cooperating, minor aggravating, and apparently
inoperative. Specifically, these factors are communal politics and politicians
support to religious fanatics, prejudices (which lead to discrimination,
avoidance, physical attack and extermination), the growth of communal
organizations, and conversions and proselytizations. Broadly speaking
attention may be focused on fanatics, anti-social elements and vested
economic interests in creating and farming violence in the rival communities. </p>
<p>
  My own thesis is that “communal violence is instigated by religious
fanatics, initiated by anti-social elements, supported by political activists
financed by vested interests and spread by the callousness of the police and the
administrators”. While these factors directly cause communal violence, the
factor which aids in spreading violence is the ecological layout of a particular
city which enables rioters to escape unapprehended. The case studies of
Baroda and Ahmedabad communal riots in Gujarat in Central India; Meerut,
Aligarh and Moradabad riots in Uttar Pradesh; Jamshedpur in West Bengal; </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000176">176</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:176 </h1>
<p>
Srinagar in Kashmir in North India; Hyderabad and Kerala riots in South
India; and Assam riots in East India vindicate my thesis. </p>
<p>
   In the holistic approach on communal violence, a few factors need expla-
nation. One is the illogical feeling of discrimination among the Muslims.
Muslims comprise 13.40 per cent (138 million) of the total population in the
country. According to a survey conducted by the minority ministry of the
Government of India, the proportion of Muslims in government services is
just 2.5 per cent (The Free Press journal, August 14, 2013). They, thus, feel
discriminated against. The fact is that the number of Muslims who compete
for these jobs is very low. All said, these excuses hardly accord any validity to
the accusations of religious discrimination and nepotism. The feeling of
discrimination among Muslims is ludicrous and irrational. </p>
<p>
     The other factor is the flow of money from the Gulf and other countries
to India. A sizeable number of Muslims migrate to the Gulf countries to earn
a handsome income and become affluent. These Muslims and the local rich
Sheikhs send money to India generously for building mosques, opening
madarsas (schools imparting Islamic education) and for running charitable
Muslim institutions. This money is, thus, believed to help Muslim fundamen-
talism. Pakistan is one country whose rulers always had a feeling of hostility
for India. All power elite have been continuously interested in creating insta-
bility in India. It has now been officially established that Pakistan is actively
supporting Muslim and Sikh terrorists (of Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab) by
providing training and military weapons. These destabilizing efforts of
Pakistan and other governments have further created ill— feeling and suspicion
among the Hindus against the Muslims. The same can be said about Hindu
militants and Hindu organizations in India which whip up antagonistic
feelings against the Muslims and Muslim organizations. Issues like the Ram
Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya, the Krishna Janmabhoomi
and nearby mosque alteration in Mathura, the dispute over Kashi Viswanath
Temple and its adjoining mosque in Varanasi, and the controversial mosque
in Sambhal claimed to be the temple of Lord Shiva from the days of Prithviraj
Chauhan, and incidents like Shahbuddin’s (Madhya Pradesh) giving a call for
non-attendance of Muslims on Republic Day and the observing of January 26,
1987 as a ‘black day’, have all aggravated the ill- feeling between the two
communities. </p>
<p>
   The mass media also sometimes contribute to communal tensions in
their own way. Many a time the news items published in papers are based on
hearsay, rumours or wrong interpretations. Such news items add fuel to the
fire and fan communal feelings. This is what happened in Ahmedabad in the
1969 riots when 'Sevak' reported that several Hindu women were stripped  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000177">177</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:177 </h1>
<p>
and raped by Muslims. Although this report was contradicted the next day,
the damage had been done. It aroused the feelings of Hindus and created a
communal riot. </p>
<p>
    One of the issues which has been agitating both Muslims and Hindus in
recent years is the Muslim Personal Law. With the decision of the Supreme
Court in favour of Shah Bano, and its advice in April 1995 to the government
that it should enact a uniform civil code, the Muslims fear that their personal
law is being interfered with. The politicians also exploit the situation to keep
themselves in power. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad, (VHP), the Shiv Sena and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS)
are the organizations which claim to be the champions of Hinduism.
Likewise, the Muslim League, the Jamait—e-Islami, the Jamait-Ulema-e-Hind,
the Majlis-e—Ittehadul Musalmeen and the Majlis-e-Mushawarat use Muslims as
their vote banks by championing their religious sentiments. The communal
politics in Jammu & Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra and Bihar are examples of such behaviour. Politicians charge the
social atmosphere with communal passion by their inflammatory speeches,
writings and propaganda. They plant the seeds of distrust in the minds of the
Muslims while the Hindus are convinced that they are unjustly coerced into
making extraordinary concessions to the Muslims in the economic, social and
cultural fields. They also exploit the deep religious traditions of both the
communities and highlight the differences in their respective practices and
rituals. The leaders also try to use economic arguments to instil fear and
suspicion in the minds of people and prepare their followers to start a riot at
the least provocation. It has happened in Bhiwandi, Moradabad, Meerut,
Ahmedabad, Aligarh and Hyderabad. </p>
<p>
   Social factors like the large sections of Muslims refusing to use family
planning measures also create suspicion and ill- feeling among the Hindus. A
few years ago, leaflets were distributed in Pune and Sholapur in Maharashtra
by the VHP downgrading the Muslims for not accepting family planning
programme and practising polygamy with an aim to allegedly increase their
population and instal a Muslim government in India. All this demonstrates
how a combination of political, economic, social, religious and administrative
factors aggravate the situation and lead to communal riots. </p>

<h1> Role of National Integration Council in Containing Communalism </h1>
<p>
A National Integration Council (NIC), a group of senior politicians and
public figures, was established in June 1962, to deal with problems of region-
alism and communalism. But this effort was not pursued in the wake of the
Chinese aggression which created national solidarity. However, this was a </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000178">178</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:178 </h1>
<p>
short-lived phenomenon and communal violence erupted in a menacing form,
with a vengeance as it were, in the sixties which led to the reconstruction of
another NIC in 1968. This time, three committees were set up to deal with
was also set up. All these committees produced worthy recommendations
focusing on guidelines, legislation and administrative action. By 1970, all this
lapsed into inaction. The Steering Committee was sought to be revived in
1973 but this did not work. In 1980, the second incarnation of the NIC
appeared and it met in 1980 and again in 1984. This time also three
sub-committees were set up but they too failed to do anything substantial.
The next incarnation took place in 1986 which focused on Punjab. The
September 1986 meeting set up a sub—group of five persons to suggest action
for the defence of the interests of the minorities and to foster national
integration and communal harmony. The report of this group was adopted by
the Council which however did not meet for the next three years. In February
1990 came yet another incarnation of the NIC which took up for its agenda
the Punjab, Kashmir and Ayodhya issues. This time too, three committees
were set up but it was later boycotted by members of the BJP. In November
1991 came the next reincarnation and only Ayodhya issue was discussed in its
meeting. A second meeting was called on December 31,1991 in which the
focus was shifted to Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab. After this, a meeting of
the NIC was held on July 18, 1993 but no solution has been evolved till date
on the burning problem of national integration and creating communal
harmony. </p>
<p>
     NIC is reconstituted from time to time. Under the present UPA rule, it
was reconstituted in August 2005. It met in October 2008, under the chair-
manship of Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, to raise its voice against
spreading anti-Christian violence in the country. In April 2010 the NIC was
reconstituted again and in its fifteenth meeting held on 10 September 2011, it
mainly focused on the issue of internal security in the country. </p>

<h1> Role of the Police </h1>
<p>
The role of the police in communal violence is to arrest trouble shooters,
disperse rioters congregated at one place, protect public property from loot
and arson, prevent the spreading of rumours (which instigate people of
different communities in other districts and states), and maintain public order.
The police cannot perform the role of enforcing law and order without the
active cooperation of politicians, bureaucrats, judiciary and the people at
large. It is seen that, by and large, the bureaucrats in our country are ritualists,
politicians function on the basis of vested interests, judicial officials are </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000179">179</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:179 </h1>
<p>
traditionalists, and people have no confidence in the police. The police have,
thus, to face many constraints in playing the roles expected of them.
Controlling riots and preventing communal violence by police have,
therefore, to be examined in the background of these constraints. </p>
<p>
      The prevention of communal violence requires a check on the
symptoms of tension building and tension management in riot-prone areas.
The police has to identify riot-prone structures in states, districts and cities
where communal riots take place frequently and keep a watch on the various
polarity-based clusters of population in the city layouts. Clusters of polar-
ity- based populations are not alike. A cluster can be predominantly
fundamentalist or liberal or radical or a mixed one. Clusters vary in their
occupations, behavioural patterns and response to leadership. Keeping a
watch on individuals in different clusters and their militant tendencies and
modus operandi is vital for the police to identify sensitive zones, common
meeting places, targets of violence, insecure belts, hide-outs and shelter places
at the time of rioting. </p>
<p>
  Tension management in riot-prone areas requires working out indices in
relation to intergroup conflicts. These indices are: identification of tension
building issues, discovery of group anxieties, treatment of issues and resto-
ration of fractured status, negotiation, mobilization of functional group and
stopping of rumours. Rumour management involves isolation of rumour
zone, counter-balance, rendering rumour mongers inoperative and sensitizing
public administration </p>

<h1> Prescriptive Measures to Meet Communalism/ Communal Violence </h1>
<p>
The canker of communal confrontation is widespread in India. Many cities
have been a communal powder keg these last several years. There are a good
number of states where communalism has taken deep and seemingly
permanent roots and communal politics is in full bloom. The support for
communalists has certainly swelled in the last few decades. Communal organi-
zations, numbering less than a dozen in 1951, have grown to over 500 now
(1997) with an active membership running into several millions. The number
of districts affected by communal violence has grown. People with established
criminal records are supporting leaders with communal philosophies and are
using them as a shield to protect themselves from police action and as a crutch
of respectability. </p>
<p>
   Measures to meet the challenge of communalism and communal
violence can be of two types: long-term and short-term (Bipan Chandra, The
Hindustan Times, August 15, 1994). The long-term remedy lies: Firstly, in initi-
ating the process of de—communalizing the people at all levels, say, by bringing </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000180">180</pagenum>
<h1> page no:180 </h1>
<p>
home to them that communal assumptions are false, by explaining to them
the socio—economic and political roots of communalism, and by telling them
that what the communalists project as the problems are not the real problems
and what they suggest as remedies are not the real remedies. Secondly,
communalization of the state and of the political elite in power has to be
checked because it leads to inaction against communal violence and covert or
overt political and ideological support to communalism by the state appara-
tuses, including the media under state control. Thirdly, the communalization
of civil society also needs to be checked because it leads to more communal
riots and other forms of communal violence. People with communal ideas
and ideologies pressurize the government to act in a manner which is always
against the principle of secularism. The secular state, the secular party in
power and the secular power elite many a time succumb to the pressures of
these communal people. It is here that intellectuals, political parties and
voluntary organizations can be most effective. Fourthly, the role of education,
particularly emphasizing on value-oriented education both in schools and
colleges/ universities, is important in preventing communal feelings.
Education based on traditional cultural ideologies can protect the young
people from philosophies and ideologies of hate. Particularly harmful in the
Indian context has been the role of the teaching of history. Communal inter-
pretation of history, specially of the medieval period, forms the bedrock of
communal ideology in India. Teaching of history along scientific lines in
educational institutions has to be a basic element in any ideological struggle
against communalism. Fifthly, the media can also prove to be significant in
preventing communal feelings. Communal press can be banned and legal
action can be taken against communal writers. Sixthly, the ideology that
economic development, industrialization, growth of capitalism and the
growth of the working class would automatically weaken and ultimately
eliminate communalism should not be overplayed. This economic
reductionist approach of the left parties and organizations like naxalites only
increases communal poison. It is not being suggested that modern economic
development is not needed in our society. What is being pointed out is that
economic development alone cannot contain communalism. It is not class
struggles which eliminate communalism but communalism surely hampers
class unity. Communal violence is more prevalent in developed states like
Maharashtra, Punjab and Gujarat and in developed cities like Mumbai,
Ahmedabad, Jamshedpur and Kanpur.</p>
<p>
Some immediate measures are imperative for containing communalism
and communal riots. Firstly, peace committees can be set up in which
individuals belonging to different religious communities can work together to</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000181">181</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:181
</h1>
<p>
spread goodwill and fellow-feelings and remove feelings of fear and hatred in
the riot-affected areas. This will be effective not only in diffusing communal
tensions but also in preventing riots from breaking out. Secondly, the state has
to plan and use new strategies in dealing with communal violence. India's
experience in recent years confirms the utility of this step. Whenever strong
and secular administrators have used or threatened the use of strong steps,
riots either did not occur or were of short duration. For example, strong
police and army intervention prevented repetition of riots in Calcutta in
November 1984 and in Mumbai in January 1994. When the anti-social
elements and religious fanatics and people with vested interests realize that the
government is impartial and the police is serious in putting down communal
violence with all the force at its command, they immediately withdraw from
spreading communal frenzy. This also calls for non-communalizing
law-enforcement agencies. Experience of riots in Mumbai, Ahmedabad,
Bhiwandi and Meerut, and violence in Amritsar, Jullundar and Ludhiana in
Punjab shows that communalized officials invariably make the communal
situation worse. Thirdly, the role of media is immensely heightened during
the course of communal violence. Newspaper can pour oil over the troubled
waters or extinguish the raging fire. The fear and hatred can be checked if the
press, radio and TV report the events in a way conducive to soothing the
frayed nerves of people instead of inflaming the temper further. The media
can contradict rumours in a sober manner. A careful restraint has to be
exercised in reporting the number of persons of different religious commu-
nities killed or injured. Lastly, the government in power has to treat the
extremist communal outfits as its immediate targets and cripple their capacity
to disrupt law and order. The secessionists in Kashmir, the militants in
Punjab, the Iss (now banned) in Kerala and other extremist organizations of
Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communalism have to be dealt with by the state
through its law and order machinery. The small insecure communities always
look to government or move towards communal parties for protection. The
Pandits in Kashmir, the innocent victims of communal riots in Mumbai,
Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and other states, and the sufferers of violence of
extremists in Bihar, Assam, etc. look towards the secular state of India for the
security of life and property. </p>
<p>
   The communalism of the 1980s and the seven years of the 1990s has
placed a clear responsibility on the doors of the secular state to confront the
communal elements who have emerged as merchants of death. Today,
communalism is on the march and secularism is on the retreat, and the state is
on the defensive. The state was on the defensive in post-Blue Star Operation
phase, on the retreat on Shah Bano case, and under siege on Mandir—Masjid </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000182">182</pagenum>
<h1> Page no:182 </h1>
<p>
issue in Ayodhya in 1992 and Hazratbal siege in November 1993 and in
Charar-e-Shrief shrine siege in May 1995. In all these situations, Sikh, Muslim
and Hindu communalists were on the offensive. The challenge of Hindu,
Muslim and Sikh communalism has to be met by the Indian state at political
and ideological levels both with short-term and long—term strategies. The
government is also facing the problem of the emergence of religion-based
politics as a central factor in public affairs and elections, although election
results in several states in the last five-six years have proved that the people
have rejected such politics. </p>
<p>
   If the surging tide of communalism is not reversed, it will swap the
country. Before independence, it was easy to argue that communal violence
was the result of the British policy of divide and rule. Now, the reality is more
complex. Religion has come to be politicized and the politics has come to be
criminalized. Unless all communities consider themselves a part of one
nation, the containing of communal disharmony will remain difficult. A
country that prides itself on the secular character of its policies has to be wary
of politicians who speak only for their own religious community. It has to
expose and alienate the bureaucrats who consider secularism only as a
theoretical possibility. The police can no longer afford to allow communal
issue to foster in the manner that it has. Stopping communally minded politi-
cians and debarring them from contesting elections, giving deterrent
punishment to religious fanatics, adopting corrective measures like keeping
the police department free from the politicians’ control, strengthening the
police intelligence section, restructuring the police force, gearing the police
administration to be more sensitive, and reworking the training programme
of police officials and enabling them to acquire a secular outlook and making
them responsible for their failures could prove to be effective measures to
tackle the problem of communal riots. An efficient police organization,
enlightened policemen, well equipped and specially trained police wings are
bound to yield positive results. </p>
<p>
   The government has also to take measures for removing the feeling of
dicrimination and deprivation which do not actually exist. The Minorities
Commission set up in 1978 during Morarji Desai’s tenure as Prime Minister,
was recognized as a statutory body in May 1992 with a view to enhancing its
effectiveness. Before this, it functioned as a toothless tiger because in the
absence of legal sanction, it could do little beyond suggesting remedies or
advising the government and the administration. The Commission is
intended to safeguard the interests of the minorities whether based on religion
or language. Its eight-point objectives are as follows:  </p>

conditions of the minorities.  </p>
<p>
   Its status was such that nobody took the Commission seriously because
both the Centre and the state governments were not bound to follow its
suggestions. Over the years, the Commission’s annual reports on the plight of
the minorities gathered dust. But the statutory status will now change the
position. Its role will not only be investigative but also a judicial one. It is
expected that with more powers, the Commission would now become a truly
effective tool in tackling the deteriorating communal situation in the country
and ensuring the welfare of the religious minorities which comprised 17 per
cent of the total population of the country. </p>
<p>
   Symbolic gestures will not suffice. It is necessary to look at the real
problems of the religious minorities in terms of employment, literacy and
getting them a fair share of representation in every field. Efforts are needed for
the development of the minority communities and removing their mass illit-
eracy and unemployment. Secular structures have to be promoted and
preserved. Vigorous attacks need to be launched on religious institutions
which foster communalism. Suspicions between communities must be rigor-
ously weeded out. A common civil code in the country is the need of the day.
There should be no special laws for specific communities and no special status
for any state. The reservation policy has to be reconsidered. Political manipu-
lation has to be tackled. Politicians interfering with police functioning and
disallowing arrests of trouble makers have to be severely dealt with. Public
opinion and mass enlightenment have to be brought about to make secular
values functional. </p>
<p>
    Along with these measures, other measures that should be undertaken
by the government to contain communal violence are: (1) Posting of </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000184">184</pagenum>

<p>
secular-minded district and police officials in riot-prone areas. (2) Setting up of
special courts to try communal offences. (3) Providing immediate relief and
adequate financial assistance to victims of communal riots for their rehabili-
tation. (4) Taking severe action against all those who incite communal
tensions or take part in violence. </p>
<p>
    Thus, multipronged measures are needed to contain the communal
tensions and bring about communal harmony in the country. We have not
only to fight religious communalism but have also to contain political
communalism which is more degrading and dangerous. A vast majority of
Muslims and Sikhs in India have no appetite for communal violence, and this
mirrors the sentiments of most Hindus. Even the members of the Muslim and
Sikh communities are convinced that the growing tension can be stopped if
politicians are somehow prevented from exploiting people for their narrow
ends. The Muslim on the street is slowly recognizing the exploitative inten-
tions of politicians. Religious sloganeering does not affect him so much now.
He no longer harbours a sneaking desire to seek economic redress across the
border. He feels far more secure here. </p>
<p>
  If Muslims and other minorities are encouraged to consider themselves
as a valuable commodity to be traded at election time, rather than being equal
citizens of a free India, they can never be motivated enough to participate in
the greater endeavour for the national good. Social scientists and intellectuals
have to evince serious interest in controlling the national malaise of
communalism and in related issues like religious violence, separatism,
secessionism, and terrorism. </p>

<h1> Theories of Communal Violence </h1>
<p>
Communal violence is a collective violence. When large sections of people in
the community fail to achieve their collective goals, or feel that they are being
discriminated against and deprived of equal opportunities, they feel frustrated
and disillusioned and this collective frustration (or what Feierabends and
Nesvold have called ‘systematic frustration’) leads to collective violence.
However, it is not the whole community which launches a violent protest. In
fact, the action planned by discontented people against the ruling group or the
power elite (against whose ways they protest) is often non-violent. It is only a
small band of protesters who consider non-violence ineffective and violence
essential for the success of the struggle, who snatch every precipitating oppor-
tunity to use violence to assert the strength of their ideology. </p>
<p>
   This sub-group indulging in violent behaviour does not represent the
whole community or the total group of discontented people. The behaviour
of this sub-group, by and large, is not equivocally supported by the rest of the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000185">185</pagenum>
<h1> Page no: 185 </h1>
<p>
community. My contention, thus, falls close to the old ‘riffraff theory’ of
violent riot behaviour which holds that the majority of the people disown and
oppose the violent/ delinquent behaviour of the sub-group by describing it as
‘irresponsible’ behaviour.  </p>
<p>
   The question is, what causes the ‘group of individuals’ to be violent.
Two of the important theoretical propositions on collective violence are: (i) it
is a normal response to provocation, and (ii) it is a response that is consistent
with norms supporting its use. This calls for the analysis of some of the
important existing theories. </p>
<p>
  Excluding the psycho-pathological theories (because they focus on the
aggressors’ psychological personality characteristics and pathological
disorders as the chief determinants of violence, and I consider these important
for explaining individual violence but not collective violence), other theories
may be classified into two categories: (a) at the level of the socio-psychological
analysis, and (b) at the level of the socio-cultural or sociological analysis. In the
first group, theories like Frustration-Aggression Theory, Perversion Theory,
Motive Attribution Theory and Self-Attitude Theory may be included, while
in the second group theories like Social Tension Theory, Anomie Theory,
Theory of Sub-culture of Violence, and Social Learning Theory may be
included. My contention is that all these theories fail to explain the
phenomenon of collective violence in communal riots. My theoretical
approach (called Social Barriers Approach) concentrates on the sociological
analysis of social-structural conditions. </p>

<h1> Social Barriers Theory </h1>
<p>
The conditions which lead to collective communal violence are: stress, status
frustration and crises of various kind. My thesis is that aggressors use violence
because they suffer from insecurity and anxiety. The origin of these feelings
and anxieties in an individual can be traced to social barriers created by the
oppressive social systems, the power elite, as well as the individual’s
background and upbringing which have probably put up hurdles for him and
which serve to aggravate his tendency to irrational and unrealistic attitudes to
social norms and social institutions. My theory also takes into account three
factors in aggressors’ behaviour, namely, adjustment (in status), attachment
(to community) and commitment (to values), as well as the social
environment (in which individuals/aggressors live) and the socialized person-
alities of the individuals (aggressors). My theoretical model, thus, gives
importance to the social system, the personality structure of individual
aggressors, and sub-cultural patterns of the society in which individuals use
violence. In social system, I include strains and frustrations which are the </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000186">186</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:186
</h1>
<p>
result of the functioning of social structures in society; in personality
structure, I include adjustment, attachment and commitment of the individual
aggresors; and in sub-cultural patterns, I include the values which operate as a
means of social control.</p>
<p>
    My thesis is that maladjustment, non-attachment, and non-commitment
of an individual lead to a feeling of relative deprivation. Relative deprivation is
the perceived discrepancy between groups’ expectations and their capabilities
(conditions of life individuals/ groups think they are capable of attaining or
maintaining, given the proper opportunities and legitimate means). Here the
important term is ‘perceived’ (by the members of the groups); hence different
variations bus in behaviour, or relative deprivations do not always lead to violent
behaviour. </p>
<p>
   Relative deprivation (of a group) occurs when (i) expectations increase
while capabilities remain the same or decline, or (ii) when expectations remain
the same while capabilities decline. Since both expectations and capabilities
rest on perception, therefore, value orientations of a group have an important
bearing on (a) the way the group will perceive deprivation, (b) the target to
which it (relative deprivation) will be directed, and (c) the form m which it
will be expressed. Since each group/ individual is subjected to different forces,
each group/ individual will respond differently in terms of violence or partici-
pation in collective communal violence. </p>
<p>
   Among the several cases of collective communal violence—Aligarh in
1978, Jamshedpur in 1979, Moradabad in 1980, Hyderabad in 1981, Meerut in
1982 and again in 1987, Bhiwandi and Delhi in 1984, Ahmedabad in 1985,
Jaipur in 1990, Varanasi in 1991, Bombay in 1993 and Calcutta in 1996—if we
take the Ahmedabad riots of 1985, we find that the violence in Ahmedabad
was the result of the feeling of deprivation. The main issue was the reservation
issue, where two groups—the anti-reservationists as well as the
pro-reservationists—felt deprived and frustrated. Their frustration was
exploited by the political parties for their vested interests and the reservation
issue came to be linked with caste and religion. Anti-social elements engaged
in bootlegging and thriving on political support were used to spread
communal distrust. Even a minor provocation was enough to cause flare-ups
in the population which was sharply divided along communal lines. </p>
<p>
  The Social Barriers Theory is not essentially an elitist theory of violence
where a small group, ideologically superior, takes the initiative to spread
violence and decides how to use it ‘for the good’ of the whole frustrated group
on whose behalf it violently vocalizes its protest. Further, the small group does
not depend upon the widespread collective action of the frustrated masses. In
this context my explanation is opposed to the orthodox Marxist theory
because Marx did not envisage this kind of uprising and mass revolution. </p>

<h1>
Theory of Polarization and Cluster Effect,Page no:187
</h1>
<p>
 This conceptual paradigm was developed based on an empirical study of
communal riots in Uttar Pradesh to explain the inter— and intra—community
violence in India (Singh, 1993). The paradigm is based on three
concepts—polarity, cleavage, and cluster. Polarity is “sense of affinity, affili-
ation, belongingness, concern and identity which people share with a
particular issue”. The issue may be religious, ideological, political or
economic in nature. Polarization is the “heightened sense of identity and
belongingness resulting in emotional, mental or physical mobilization of
individuals or groups to cause cohesion”. Cleavage is a phenomenon by which
population in a particular place is divided into two different polarities which
have conflicting, contrasting or opposite principles or tendencies. Cluster
refers to the habitation pattern of the people belonging to one polarity sharing
commonness in a given area at a particular time. The paradigm has been built
up on the basis of the facts in ‘pre—riot’, ‘riot’ and ‘post-riot’ situations and the
analysis of group behaviour of individuals belonging to different social groups
(polarities) in animosity with each other. Since the communal disturbances
involve two antagonistic social groups, it necessitates a careful analysis of
animosity (state of mind and psyche), structural conduciveness (physical
situation), and prejudices. </p>
<p>
   The individual in isolation is weak and insecure. The strength lies in
assemblies, collectivities and groups. The individual Joins them for his gain
and security. Various polarities exist in society at all times. To each individual,
these polarities are references in the matter of interpersonal relationships. The
polarities are of two types—permanent and temporary. To the former
category belong ideology, religion, language, caste, region and sex. These
polarities constitute individual’s basic identity which lasts with the individual.
To the second category belong occupation, profession, functions based on
vested interests. Though normally the polarities are not mutually exclusive
but they become exclusive when the society undergoes a cleavage
phenomenon due to perceived difference and division of the population as a
consequence of polarization. When masses in general assign the same closeness
to single polarity, it becomes a dominating polarity at that time at that
particular place for that particular population. This dominant polarity sets the
pattern of inhibitions of the population (cluster formation), that is, the polar-
ity-based clusters determine the demographic living pattern. Such clusters in
old cities and towns are based on religion, caste and sect, but in modern cities
these are more class-based. When such clustering takes place because of two
different polarities (say, of religion/ or religious sects), there is a clash. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000188">188</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:189
</h1>
<p>
    The social dynamics of living in clusters is that these prove highly
conducive to the emergence of a riot-prone situation, as interpersonal relation-
ships deteriorate and build irritants which are often perceived as deliberate
insult, deprivation and injury by one to the other. The incidents affect most
people in the clusters due to the physical proximity. This prompts people to
build contacts among one’s own polarity population and also facilitates the
building of mass insurrection. </p>
<p>
    The communal call given at the level of leadership also accelerates the
process of polarization. For example, Shahi Imam Bukhari’ s inﬂammatory
speech in Meerut city to the Muslim population in 1982 sparked off a great
reaction among Hindus to polarize against Muslims to safeguard their
interest which ultimately resulted in communal riots in the city. He gave a
similar provocative speech in Anantnag, Kashmir on April 8,1988, inciting
Kashmiri Muslims by claiming that they have been enslaved since the
partition. He asserted that the Centre had not created better economic
conditions for them, they were being deprived of their rights, and their
problems were not looked into. </p>
<p>
    The nature of polarity dominance depends upon five factors: (1) time
and space (that is, period, area, location and situation or geographical limits),
(2)social structure (that is, caste, community and social group), (3) education
(that is awareness of interest), (4) economic interests, and (5) leadership (that is, emotional speeches, promises and policies of the leaders). </p>
<p>
    On the basis of the above analysis, V.V. Singh (1993) describes the
riot -prone (communal) structure as follows: </p>
<p>
(1) bi-polarity population in identifiable clusters;
(2) close proximity;
(3) common interest and resultant animosity;
(4) potency of polarized population, which is based on numerical strength,
economic prosperity, state of possession of arms, cohesion, type of
leadersh1p, and the strength of activity; and
(5) administrative expediency and inefficiency of district police and public
administration. </p>

                   <h1>  Secularism </h1>

The word ‘secular’ refers to things which are not religious or spiritual. The

against this practice. These people came to be known as ‘secular’ which meant
“separate from church” or “against church”. In India, this term was used in a
different context after independence. After the partition of the country, the
politicians wanted to assure the minority communities, particularly the
Muslims, that they would not be discriminated against in any way. Hence, the
new Constitution provided that India would remain ‘secular’ in the Consti-
tution, which meant that: (a) each citizen would be guaranteed full freedom to
practise and preach his religion, (b) state will have no religion, and (c)all
citizens, irrespective of their religious faith, will be equal. In this way, even the
agnostics were given the same rights as believers. This indicates that a secular
state or society is not an irreligious society. Religions exist, their followers
continue to believe in and practise the religious principles enshrined in their
holy books, and no outside agency, including the state, interferes in the legit-
imate religious affairs. In other words, two important ingredients of a secular </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000190">190</pagenum>

Page no:190
</h1>
<p>
society are: (a) complete separation of state and religion, and (b) full liberty for
the followers of all religions as well as atheists and agnostics to follow their
respective faiths. </p>
<p>
     In a secular society, the leaders and followers of various religious
communities are expected not to use their religion for political purposes.
However, in practice, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious communities
do use religion for political goals. Each political party labels other political
parties as non-secular. After the demolition of Babri Masjid structure at
Ayodhya in December 1992, a case (popularly called S.R. Bommai case) was
filed in a court for the dismissal of the state governments run by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP). The judges constituting the nine-judge bench dwelt upon
the term ‘secularism’ and averred that though the term was embedded in the
Constitution it was wisely left undefined because it was not capable of any
precise definition. Secularism in the Constitution guaranteed equal treatment
to all religions, and state governments were to regulate the law in order to
enforce secularism. As such, on legal consideration the plea for dismissal of
BJP governments was not accepted. No wonder, some people say that S.R.
Bommai’s case in the Supreme Court was just ganging up against one political
party (BJP). In a another case involving the Chief Minister of Maharashtra,
the Supreme Court had held that an appeal to Hindutva was permissible
under the Representation of the People Act. What was banned was the
critisism of the other party’s religion. It may thus be said that secularism for
political parties has implied the creation of a vote bank comprising Muslims
and the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. In the elections for the Lok
Sabha in May 1996 and for Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha in October 1996,
when the BJP emerged as the largest single party at the centre as well as in
Uttar Pradesh, political parties with vested interests joined together in
describing the BJP as a communal party. The cry against communalism was
the Centre (in June 1996) was based not on any common acceptable minimum
programme but only on one and programme of preventing a so—called ‘Hindu
party’ from forming a government. </p>
<p>
    Communalism, thus, is neither a political philosophy nor an ideology
nor a principle. It came to be imposed on the Indian society with a political
objective. The communal-secular card is now being played for political
motives only. The bogey of communalism is being kept alive not for checking
national disintegration but with a view that minority vote bank does not
dissipate itself into the larger Indian ethos. Even those political leaders who
are too corrupt and who extensively practise casteism accuse political leaders
of opposite parties for being communal. The power seekers thus use </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000191">191</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
 secularism as a shield to hide their sins, thereby ensuring that people remain
polarized on the basis of religion and India remains communalized.  </p>

                    <h1> Regionalization </h1>
<p>
India is a highly diverse pluralistic society and a federal state whose social
dynamics in the last 65 years needs to be understood and analysed rationally.
At the time of independence, it was a smaller nation both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Since then, not only its population has increased from 340
million to about 1,210 million (in 2011) but economically, educationally,
socially and politically too it has matured. After 1947, on one hand, the
country was consolidated by the integration of princely states, and on the
other some states were reorganized (like Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960 or
Punjab and Haryana in 1966) for improving administration, some new states
were created to accommodate some regional aspirations and local autonomy
like Andhra Pradesh (1956), Nagaland (1963), Himachal Pradesh(1971),
Manipur (1972), Meghalaya (1972), Tripura (1972), Arunachal Pradesh (1987),
Mizoram (1987), Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand (2000), Uttarakhand (2006) and
Telangana (2013), some states were added to Indian Union like Puducherry.
Goa and Sikkim (1975), while the demand for creating some more states is
increasing for safeguarding language or protecting cultural identities (like
Bodoland, Vidarbha, Gorkhaland, etc.). Some autonomous zonal councils
have been created to provide for varying degrees of self-determination within
states (like Gorkhaland within West Bengal and Bodoland within Assam). </p>
<p>
There have been arguments both for and against this regionalization and
creation of states. One school finds nothing wrong in this regionalizations
(division of geographical territory with definite boundaries) because it fulfills
democratic urges, facilitates political management, smoothens development,
provides for greater access to and participation in the decision-making process
enhances local accountability and increases national unity. This school also
refers to recent event in countries like Canada, Belgium, Czechoslovakia
Yugoslavia, Russia and Pakistan, which are becoming more and more
unstable for not accommodating the regional demands of people. Pakistan
broke up because it refused to accept and respect the Bangla identity. Now,it
is facing the problem of the so-called Mohajirs and minorities. The others
school describes regionalization as a process of balkanization of the country
which divides people raising slogans like “Maharashtra for Maharashtrians" and
“Assam for Assamese only”, and creates agitations and violence. Some people
are worried about the demand for greater autonomy for states like Jammu &
Kashmir which may catalyze such demands for more autonomous regions
Each act of fragmentation is thus seen as encouraging further fragmentation </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000192">192</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:192
</h1>
<p>
The questions is: Is optimism of the first school logical or is the pessimism of
the second school mistaken? It is true that at times feelings of regionalism and
regionalization become so strong that states do not want to share even the
river water (like Kaveri water by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) or electricity
(like Punjab and Delhi) with their neighbour states. States like Assam claim
that in spite of their great contribution to national economic growth through
oil and jute, they are totally neglected in development schemes, while states
like Jammu & Kashmir hold that being a Muslim—dominated state, it is
discriminated in industrial development schemes. While economic
backwardness of certain regions is at the root of the unrest there (i.e.,
Gorkhaland in West Bengal, Bodoland in Assam), some demands for new
states are purely politically motivated (like Harit Pradesh bifurcating Uttar
Pradesh). With increasing social and political awareness among all levels of
people, it is not difficult to mobilize masses for demanding a place in the sun.
If people's protests are ignored, law and order problems are bound to escalate.
Such problems cannot be suppressed for long or put down with a firm hand.
It will compel people to take to violence. The gulf between “them” and “us”
has to be bridged through accommodation and compromises. The growing
population in many states will be difficult to manage. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra are such states. While in 1947, there were 300
districts in the country, today there are 671 districts. Several districts are or
may even become larger in area and population than many members of the
United Nations. Hence, the rationale of new smaller states need not neces—
sarily be perceived as balkanization or growth of regionalism and
regionalization, If number of states increase to 50 and number of districts
increase to 750, administrative management may be more efficient, account-
ability may improve, and democratic participation may increase, provided of
course the new states are economically viable. National integrity will not be
imperiled only by creating new political or administrative units.
Regionalization, if sensibly handled, will not disintegrate India. Ethnic senti-
ments and linguistic homogeneity, however, may not be desirable as
considerations calling for the creation of new states. There is the severe
resources crunch. There is also the problem created by militancy in certain
parts of the country. Dangers, both internal and external, loom large. As such,
the demand for new states has to be effectively scotched and conceded only
after careful scrutiny of each case on the basis of economic development and
administrative convenience.  </p>

Backward Castes, Tribes
and Classes
</h1>
<p>
The amelioration of the lot of the underprivileged people in India, particu-
larly of the tribes and those castes and classes which are given an inferior status
due to the accident of birth, has to be an important aim of any government
committed to democracy. </p>
<p>
    The Constitution of India prescribes protection and safeguards for the
Scheduled Castes (SCs or dalits) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and now even
for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) with the object of removing their social
disabilities and promoting their varied interests. The main safeguards are:
abolition of untouchability, protection from social injustice and various
forms of exploitation, throwing open religious institutions of public
character to all sections, removal of restrictions on access to shops, restau-
rants, wells, tanks, and roads, giving them the right to move freely and
acquire property, giving them the right of admission to educational institu-
tions and receiving grants out of state funds, permitting the state to make
reservation for them in services, giving them special representation in the
Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, setting up separate departments and advisory
councils to promote their welfare and safeguard their interests, prohibition
of forced labour, and making special provision for the administration and
control of the scheduled areas. </p>
<p>
  The machinery for safeguarding the interests of SCs and STs was
created in the form of setting up a Commission for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. This was later on renamed as National Commission for </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000195">195</pagenum>

<p>
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and was given constitutional status
on March 12, 1992.</p>
<p>
    At present, there exist two separate commissions for SCs and STs. In
fact, it was later on brought to the notice of the government that not only
geographically and culturally, the STs were different from the SCs but their
problems were also different from those of the problems of the SCs. In recog
nition of this public perception, a new Ministry of Tribal Affairs was created
in October 1999 to provide a sharp focus to the welfare and development of
STs. It was felt necessary that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs should coordinate
all activities relating to the STs, as it would not be administratively feasible from
the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment to perform this role. It was
also felt necessary that a separate National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
(NCST) also be set up to safeguard the interests of STs more effectively by
bifurcating the existing National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. The NCST is the outcome of this realization which was seem
up in February 2004 to monitor all matters relating to the welfare of STs. </p>
<p>
      For the welfare of SCs, the National Commission for Scheduled Caste
(NCSC) is committed to the full implementation of the various acts like the
PCR Act, 1955 and SC and ST (POA) Act, 1989. It endeavours to ensure than
the economic development schemes for SCs are implemented as per guideline
and every penny of the government is spent appropriately exclusively for
their benefit. It also endeavours to ensure that reservations implemented on
every level, strictly as per government rules and regulations. The important
functions of the NCSC are: </p>
<p>
0 to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguard
provided for the SCs under the Constitution of India or any other
law in force or under any order of the government and to evaluate the
working of such safeguards;

0 to inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of
rights and safeguards of the SCs;

0 to participate and advise on the planning process of socio- economic
development of the SCs and to evaluate the progress of their devel-
opment under the Union and any State;

0 to present to the President, annually and at such other times as the
Commission may deem fit, reports upon the working of those
safeguards;

0 to make in such reports/recommendations as to the measures that
should be taken by the Union or any State for the effective implemen-
tation of those safeguards and other measures for the protection
welfare and socio—economic development of the SCs; and </p>

President may, subject to the provisions of any law made by
parliament, specify.
The functions of the NCST are almost the same as those of NCSC. </p>
<p>
The state governments have separate departments to look after the
welfare of SCs, STs and OBCs. Their administrative set-up, however, varies
from state to state. A number of voluntary organizations also promote the
welfare of dalits and tribals. The important organizations of an all- India
character include the Harijan Sevak Sangh, Delhi; the Hindu Sweepers Sevak
samaj, New Delhi; and the Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sangh, New Delhi. </p>
<p>
    The welfare of SCs/STs/OBCs has been given special attention at the
level of central government under both the plan and non-plan expenditures as
the size of expenditure has been increasing every year. While in 2000-01 it was
Rs 968 crore, it increased to Rs 1,093 crore in 2001—02, to Rs 1,152 in 2002—03,
to Rs 1,144 crore in 2003—04 to Rs 1,270 in 2004—05 and to Rs 1,508 in
2005—06 (India 2006-07: 202, Observer Statistical Handbook). The state
governments have also been spending a sizeable amount on the welfare of
dalits and tribals. </p>
<p>
     Some of the important centrally sponsored schemes are: (1) coaching and
training for various competitive examinations (IAS, IPS, etc.) in order to
improve the representation of SCs and STs in various services; (2) providing
post-matric scholarships to students for higher education, (3) launching
vocational training in tribal areas and educational complexes in low literacy
pockets for promotion of female literacy in tribal areas, (4) construction of
hostels for providing residential facilities to SC and ST girls studying in
schools, colleges and universities, (5) financial assistance to reputed social
science research institutions for research in development and problems of SCs
and STs, (6) providing textbooks to SC and ST students of
medical/ engineering courses, and (7) scholarships and passage grants for
higher education abroad. </p>
<p>
  Besides the above measures to bring about their speedy development, the
Constitution has also provided for adequate representation in the legislative
organs at different levels as well as reservation in services and educational insti-
tutions. The reservation is 15 per cent for the SCs and 7.5 per cent for the STs.
This limit has been exceeded in several states. For example, in the states in the
north-east, the reservation for STs has reached the level of 85 per cent. There
are moves in some states in the north-east to increase this percentage to 95.
Other states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar are not far
behind in this regard. </p>

<p>
Though the principle of separate electorate was not accepted but the
constituencies are earmarked from time to time from which persons
belonging only to either SCS or STs can seek election. The number of reserved
seats reflects their proportion in the population. </p>
<p>
    In government services, special quotas are allotted to them. The reserva-
tions are not only confined to recruitments but they are also extended to
promotions for higher positions. To facilitate their adequate representation,
concessions such as relaxation of age limit, relaxation in the standards of
suitability, relaxation of the qualification and experience, have also been
provided to them. </p>

                        <h1> The Scheduled Tribes </h1>
<p>
The Strength
There are altogether 705 ethnic groups, etc. which are notified as Scheduled
Tribes (STS) in the 30 states/UTs of the country. Their total population
according to the 2011 Census, is 104.30 million, and formed 8.60 per cent of
the country’s total population. Of the total tribal population, 52.40 million
are males and 51.90 are females. Similarly, majority (i. e., 90%) of the tribals
live in rural areas, whereas some (i. e., 10%) live in urban areas too. While, the
overall growth of population during the decade 2001-2011 has been 17.64 per
cent, it is 23.70 per cent in case of STs. It is said that India is home to almost
more than half of world’s tribal population. </p>
<p>
The tribals in India are spread over the length and breadth of the
country. They also vary in strength from a few thousands to several lakhs. In
2011, state-wise, the distribution of the ST population is as under: Madhya
Pradesh: 14.70 per cent; Maharashtra: 10.10 per cent; Odisha: 9.20 per cent;
Rajasthan: 8. 90 per cent; Gujarat: 8. 60 per cent; Jharkhand: 8. 30 per cent;
Chhattisgarh: 7. 50 per cent; Andhra Pradesh: 5. 70 per cent; West Bengal:5.10
per cent; Karnataka: 4.10 per cent; Assam: 3. 70 per cent; Meghalaya: 2. 50 per
cent; and rest: 11.60 per cent </p>
<p>
   The top five states/ UTs ranked by the proportion of STs are
Lakshadweep (94.80%), Mizoram (94.40%), Nagaland (86.50%), Meghalaya
(86.10%) and Arunachal Pradesh (68. 80%). Similarly, the bottom five
states/ UTs are Uttar Pradesh (0.60%), Tamil Nadu (1.10%), Bihar (1.30%)
Kerala (1.50%) and Uttarakhand (2.90%).</p>
<p>
Some of the important features of the tribals are: most of them live in
isolated terrains; the main sources of their livelihood are agriculture and
gathering of forest produce; they do not cultivate for profit; they still largely
rely on barter system; they spend a greater part of their earnings social and </p>

<p>
religious ceremonies; and a large number of them are illiterate and are
victimized by unscrupulous forest contractors and moneylenders. </p>

<h1> Exploitation and Unrest </h1>
<p>
For ages, tribals were considered a primitive segment of Indian society. They
lived in forests and hills without having more than a casual contact with the
so-called civilized and advanced neighbours. There being no population
pressures, there was no attempt to penetrate their areas and impose alien
values and beliefs on the tribals. But, when the British consolidated their
position in the country, their colonial aspirations and administrative needs
necessitated to ‘open up’ the entire country through an effective communi-
cation system. The British introduced the system of landownership and
revenue. Annual tax was trebled which was beyond the paying capacity of
tribal cultivators. Under the increasing pressure of population, many
outsiders also started settling in tribal regions. With their money power,
they offered credit facilities at the doorstep. Initially, it provided relief to
tribals but gradually the system became exploitative. Newly established
courts of law helped the exploiters. This economic, and later social and
cultural exploitation aroused the tribal leaders to mobilize the tribals and
start agitations. With the increasing feelings of deprivation, mass agitations,
struggles and movements also increased. Initially, they were against the
blood suckers and usurpers of their rights but ultimately they turned against
the government or the rulers. </p>
<p>
   Tribal unrest and discontent, thus, may be described as the cumulative
result of a number of contributory factors. The main factors were :</p>
<p>
0 Lethargy, indifference, and lack of sympathy from administrators
and bureaucrats in dealing with tribal grievances.
0 Harshness of forest laws and regulations.
0 Lack of legislation to prevent the passing of tribal lands into the
  hands of non-tribals.
0 Lack of credit facilities.
0 Ineffective government measures to rehabilitate tribal population.
0 Lack of interest and dynamism among the political elite to solve
tribal problems.

0 Delay in the implementation of recommendations made by high level
  bodies.
0 Discrimination in implementation of reformatory measures.
In short, the causes of tribal unrest may be described as economic, social
and political
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000199">199</pagenum>
<h1>
Tribal Problems, Page no:199
</h1>
<p>
The main problems the tribals face are:

0 They possess small and uneconomical land holdings because of which
their crop yield is less and hence they remain chronically indebted. </p>
<p>
0 Only a small percentage of the population participates in occupa-
tional activities in the secondary and tertiary sectors. </p>
<p>
0 Though literacy among the tribals has increased considerably over
the years, it is still low in comparison to the general population
According to NSSO (66th round) report for 2009-10, of the total
tribal population of 15 years and above, 47 per cent in rural areas and
21. 8 per cent in urban areas were illiterate. Further, in rural areas,
while 24.2 per cent were educated up to the primary level, the corre-
sponding figure for rural areas was 17.1 per cent. Similarly, while
there were only 1.6 per cent tribals with graduate and above qualifi-
cation in rural areas, this percentage was comparatively much higher,
i.e., 12.6 per cent, in urban areas. Thus, low literacy among tribals has
been identified as a major development problem.  </p>
<p>
0 A good portion of the land in tribal areas has been legally transferred
to non-tribals. Tribals demand that this land should be returned to
them. In fact, the tribals had earlier enjoyed considerable freedom to
use the forest and hunt the animals. Forests not only provide them
materials to build their homes but also give them fuel, herbal
medicines for curing diseases, fruits, wild games, etc. Their religion
makes them believe that many of their spirits live in trees and forests.
Their folk-tales often speak about the relations of human beings and
the spirits. Because of such physical and emotional attachment to
forest, the tribals have reacted sharply to restrictions imposed by the
government on their traditional rights. </p>
<p>
0 Tribal development programmes have not significantly helped the
tribals in raising their economic status. The British policy had led to
ruthless exploitation of the tribals in various ways as it favoured the
zamindars, landlords, moneylenders, forest contractors, and excise,
revenue and police officials. </p>
<p>
0 Banking facilities in the tribal areas are so inadequate that the tribals
have to depend mainly on the moneylenders. Being miserably bogged
down in indebtedness, the tribals, therefore, demand that Agricul-
tural Indebtedness Relief Acts should be enacted so that they may get
back their mortgaged land. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000200">200</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:200
</h1>
<p>
0 About 90 per cent of the tribals are engaged in cultivation and most of
them are landless and practise shifting cultivation. They need to be
helped in adopting new methods of cultivation.

0 The unemployed and the underemployed want help in finding
secondary sources of earning by developing animal husbandry,
poultry farming, handloom weaving and the handicrafts sector.

0 Most of the tribals live in sparsely populated hills and communication
in the tribal areas remains tough. The tribals, therefore, need to be
protected from leading an isolated life, away from towns and cities,
through the network of new roads.

0 The tribals are exploited by Christian missionaries. In several tribal
areas, mass conversion to Christianity had taken place during the
British period. While the missionaries have been the pioneers in
education and opened hospitals in tribal areas, they have also been
responsible for alienating the tribals from their culture. Christian
missionaries are said to have many a time instigated the tribals to
revolt against the Indian government. </p>
<p>
    Relations between the tribals and non-tribals are worsening and
non-tribal residents are increasingly depending for protection on the
para military forces. The demand for separate states for tribals has taken the
shape of insurgency in Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Bihar, Manipur,
arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. Neighbouring countries, unfriendly to India,
are active in exploiting these anti-Indian sentiments. Infiltration of foreign
nationals, gun-running, trafficking in narcotics and smuggling are very serious
problems in these states surrounded by tribals belts. </p>
<p>
   In short, the main problems of the tribals are poverty, indebtedness, illit-
eracy, bondage, exploitation, disease and unemployment. </p>

<h1> Tribal Struggles </h1>
<p>
Numerous uprisings of the tribals have taken place beginning with the one in
Bihar in 1772, followed by many revolts in Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Mizoram and Nagaland. The
important tribes involved in revolt in the nineteenth century were Mizos
(1810),Kols (1795 and 1831), Mundas (1889), Daflas (1875), Khasi and Garo
(1829), Kacharis (1839), Santhals (1853), Muria Gonds (1886), Nagas (1844 and
1879), Bhuiyas (1868) and Kondhs (1817).</p>
<p>
    After independence, the tribal struggles may be classified into three
groups:(1) struggles due to exploitation of outsiders (like those of the Santhals
and the Mundas), (2 ) struggles due to economic deprivation (like those of the
Gonds in Madhya Pradesh and the Mahars in Andhra Pradesh), and (3)
struggles due to separatist tendencies (like those of the Nagas and Mizos). </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000201">201</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:201
</h1>
<p>
  The tribal movements may also be classified on the basis of their orien-
tation into four types: (1) movements seeking political autonomy and
formation of a state (Nagas, Mizos, Jharkhand), (2) agrarian movements, (3)
forest-based movements, and (4) socio-religious or socio—cultural movements
(the Bhagat movement among Bhils of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,
movement among tribals of south Gujarat or the Raghunath Murmu’s
movement among the Santhals). </p>
<p>
   If we take into consideration all the tribal movements, including the
Naga revolution (which was started in 1948 and continued up to 1972 when
the new elected government came to power and the Naga insurgency was
controlled), the Mizo movement (guerrilla warfare which ended with the
formation of Meghalaya state in April 1970, created out of Assam and
Mizoram in 1972), the Gond Raj movement (of Gonds of Madhya Pradesh
and Maharashtra, started in 1941 for a separate state and reaching its peak in
1962-63), the Naxalite movements (of the tribals in Bihar, West Bengal,
Andhra Pradesh and Assam), the agrarian movements (of the Gonds and the
Bhils in Madhya Pradesh), and the forest-based movements (of the Gonds for
getting customary rights in the forests), it could be said that the tribal unrest
and the resultant movements were mainly the movements launched for liber-
ation from (i) oppression and discrimination, (ii) neglect and backwaradness,
and (iii) a government which was callous to the tribals’ plight of poverty,
hunger, unemployment and exploitation. </p>
<p>
    Three instances of tribal exploitation are highlighted to explain the cause
of their struggles. At the time of independence, there existed a government
order in Andhra Pradesh according to which all land transactions had to be in
favour of the tribals. In 1974, the then Congress government passed an order
which permitted non—tribals to own 15 acres (5 wet and 10 dry) of land in the
area. After this order, the non-tribals took away a sizeable part of tribal land.
Tribals claimed that about 30,000 acres of land had passed into the hands of
non-tribals in between 1974 and 1984. During this period, 2,000 cases of land
disputes were lodged in courts and 400 tribals, convicted. The Telugu Desam
government quashed the Congress government order in 1984 because of
which the non—tribals took a defensive position. The tribals were organized by
the extremists against the non-tribal feudal classes. There were series of
incidents of violence between the Gonds (tribals) and the non-tribals. In one
such incident, the tribals took away standing crops of cotton and jowar of the
non-tribals. The non—tribals put up a fight. They burned the tribal hutments,
criminally assaulted women, wounded and killed the tribals and forced them
to do bonded labour for them. In another incident, 4O tribals were caught by
250 non-tribals and handed over to the police after a night of beating. In yet </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000202">202</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:202
</h1>
<p>
another instance, 21 non-tribals who were allegedly stealing firewood from
the forest were caught by the tribals and taken to their village and kept
imprisoned till the police rescued them.  </p>
<p>
   In another case, on March 10, 1984, the Gonds hoisted a flag atop a
temple in a place called Keslapur in Adilabad district in Andhra Pradesh.
Some described it as religious flag and others described it as a banner of revolt.
The police reached the place and when it left, 40 persons had been injured and
70 arrested. It claimed that “the revolt of the tribals at the behest of the
Naxalites had been suppressed”. Was it really a revolt or was it merely an
eruption of discontent?  </p>
<p>
   The third case refers to a tribal convention organized on February
25-26, 1984 in Vidarbha region near Nagpur in Maharashtra. The venue was a
small village called Kamalpur, with a population of 1,000 persons. The
convention was expected to be attended by 20,000 persons. It was to be
inaugurated by the President of Nagpur High Court Bar Association and
presided over by persons like Vijay Tendulkar (playwright), Tapan Bose (film
director) and Suhasini (cine artist). Two days before the conference, all routes
leading to the venue were sealed, 1,000 persons were arrested, and prohibitory
orders banning the assembly of five or more persons were issued. Interest-
ingly, the persons arrested were funnily charged carrying objectionable
literature, felling trees in forests, and theft of forest wealth (Onlookeer,7 April,  1984:29).The chairman of the Reception Committee was arrested under the
charge of theft of forest wealth. He was released by the magistrate but
promptly rearrested on a different charge. Among others arrested included
musicians who were to perform at the convention, and representatives of
student organizations from Bombay (now Mumbai), Hyderabad and Madras
with a few Chennai). Thus, what could have passed off as innocuous conference
with a few fiery speeches was transformed into a major episode giving the
venue a battlefield looks.  </p>
<p>
  All this depicts the frustrations of the tribals. When the law does not
help them, the government remains callous, and the police fails to protect
them, and also harasses them, they take up arms against the exploiters. These
struggles and movements indicate that the tribals adopted two paths of
achieving goals: (a) non-violent path of bargaining and negotiating with the
government and using a variety of pressure tactics without resorting to
violence/ revolts, and (b) militant path of revolts or mass struggles based on
developing the fighting power of the exploited/ oppressed tribal strata. The
conseqences of both these paths are different. One indicates struggle oriented
to reforms, while the other indicates structural transformation of the
community. The fact that tribals continue to befaced with problems and also  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000203">203</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:203
</h1>
<p>
 continue to feel discontented and deprived, brings to the fore the conclusion
that both the paths have not helped them to achieve their goals. </p>

<h1> Crime Against Scheduled Tribes </h1>
<p>
The number of crimes committed against STs was 5,992 in 2012 as against 5,756
in 2011, showing an increase of 2.9 per cent in 2012 over 2011 (Crime in India,
2012: 4). Rajasthan reported the highest number of crimes (1,351 or 22.8%)of
the total crimes against STs, followed by Madhya Pradesh (1,218 or 20.57%),
Odisha (688 or 11.62%) and Andhra Pradesh (666 or 11.25%). However, the
crime rate was highest in Kerala at 25.6 as compared to only 5.7 at national
level. Of the total cases, 1,311 pertained to SC/ ST Prevention of Atrocities Act,
816 to hurt, 729 to rape, 156 to murder and 103 to kidnapping and abduction
(ibid.: 113). State-wise rate of crime committed against STs during 2012 was as
follows Kerala: 25.8, Rajasthan: 14.62 per cent, Andhra Pradesh: 11.25 Bihar:
8.90, Karnataka: 8.80 and Madhya Pradesh: 7.95 (ibid.: 114).  </p>

<h1> Development Programmes for STs </h1>
<p>
The British had superimposed their own administrative patterns in tribal areas
and deprived the tribals of their traditional methods of interacting with
people. The tribals have no written laws but the sanction of the community
has a force which none dares to violate. Every able-bodied person is ready to
lay down his life in defence of his village in the event of a crisis. A tribal village
had been an autonomous unit and, barring areas such as the Mizo and Khasi
Hills where the administration of number of villages was sometimes coordi-
nated under a chief assisted by a council of elders, a village remained
independent for all intents and purposes. The isolation helped the tribals to
retain the shape and strength of their social institutions and social structures. </p> <p>
After independence, the Constituent Assembly appointed a
sub-committee under the chairmanship of A.V. Thakkar, after whose recom
mendations the development of tribal areas became an integral part of
development of the Indian people as a whole. </p>
<p>
The bonded labour in tribal areas was prohibited under the Constitution
of India. In practice, however, it continues to exist in one form or the other in
tribal areas of most of the states. In 1976, when the Bonded Labour System
(Abolition) Act was passed, it was found that 80 per cent of the bonded
labourers in the country belonged to SCs and STs. To loosen the grip of the
moneylenders and the mahajans on the tribals, the government organized,
Large Area Multi-Purpose Societies (LAMPS). However, their performance
has been reported to be poor. There have been a large number of instances
when the tribals have been cheated into signing bank loans. The cooperative </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000204">204</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:204
</h1>
<p>
societies failed to extend adequate credit for productive purposes, to purchase
agricultural and minor forest produce from the tribals and fair price shops of
essential consumer goods. </p>
<p>
    Tribal development has been based on a two-pronged approach: (a)
promotion of development activities to raise the level of living of the Scheduled
Tribes, and (b) protection of their interests through legal and administrative
Support. The tribal sub-plans (TSP) evolved for the tribal development projects
during the Fifth— Five Year Plan (1974—79) and today cover 22 states and two
union territories, and about 38 million tribal population. The TSP is mainly an
area development plan. The financial resources for the sub-plans are drawn
from state plans, special central assistance (by the Ministry of Welfare), central
ministries’ programmes, and institutional finance. </p>
<p>
The amount allocated for the tribal sub-plans has been increasing from Rs
759 crore during the Fifth Plan (1974—79) to Rs 16,902 crore by the end of the
Eighth Plan (1992—97). During the Eighth Plan, the specific objectives set forth
under the tribal sub—plan strategy were: (i) raising production in the field of
agriculture, small industries, horticulture, and animal husbandry, (ii) elimination
exploitation of tribals in money lending, bondage, use of forests, liquor
vending etc., (ii1) development of education and training programmes, (iv) devel-
opment of tribal areas, and (v) upgradation of environment of tribal areas. </p>
<p>
The 20-point Programme, too, focused attention on the development of
Sts, including assisting the tribal families economically to enable them to
cross the poverty line. During 1994—95 and 1995-96, about 20 lakh ST families
wwere assisted under the programme to cross the poverty line. </p>
<p>
The Tribal Research Institutes (TRIS) also play a useful role not only in
the research and training of the tribals but also in the formulation of tribal
sub-plans, project reports and their evaluation. These institutions at present
are functioning in 18 states/ UTs including Andhra Pradesh, Manipur,
Assam ,Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Andaman & Nicobar Islands,
Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. For
marketting the tribal produce, the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Devel-
opment Federation of India (TRIFED) has been set up. It also works for
eliminating exploitation of the tribals and for the realization of better prices. </p>
           <h1> Scheduled Castes </h1>
<p>
The Strength
There are  altogether 1,241 ethnic groups, etc., which are notified as Scheduled
Castes (SCS; also called as dalits) in the 31 states/ UTs of the country. Their </p>

<p>
total population, according to 2011 Census, is 201.40 million and comprised
16.60 per cent of the country’s total population. In the period 2001-2011,the
SCs grew by 20.80 per cent whereas the total population has witnessed a
decadal increase of 17.64 per cent to touch 1.21 billion. </p>
<p>
Like the STs, the SCs are also spread all over the country. State-wise, the
distribution of the SC population in 2011 is as under: Uttar Pradesh: 20.50 per
cent; West Bengal: 16.70 per cent, Bihar: 8.20 per cent; Tamil Nadu: 7.20 per
cent; Andhra Pradesh: 6.90 per cent; Maharashtra: 6.60 per cent; Rajasthan:
6.10 per cent; Madhya Pradesh: 5.20 per cent; Punjab: 4.40 per cent; Odisha:
3.6 per cent; and rest: 15 per cent. </p>
<p>
The top five states in terms of the proportion of SCs are Punjab
(31.90%), Himachal Pradesh (25.20%), West Bengal (23.50%), Uttar Pradesh
(20.70%) and Haryana (20.20%). Similarly, the bottom five states are Mizoram
(0.10%), Meghalaya (0.60%), Goa (1.70%), Dadra & Nagar Haveli (1.80%) and
Daman & Diu (2.50%).</p>

<h1> Development Strategies for the Scheduled Castes </h1>
<p>
A comprehensive three—pronged strategy was evolved for the development of
the SCs during the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980—85). This was a combination of
three schemes. (i) Special Component Plans (SCPs) of the central ministries
and state governments, (ii) Special Central Assistance (SCA) to SCPs for the
SCs of the states, and (iii) Scheduled Caste Development Corporations
(SCDCs) in the states. </p>
<p>
The SCPs envisage identification of schemes of development which
would benefit SCs, quantification of funds from all divisible programmes, and
determination of specific targets as to the number of families to be benefited
from these programmes. The overall objective is to assist SC families to
substantially improve their income. The provision of basic services and facil-
ities and of access to opportunities for social and educational development are
also to be brought under the purview of the SCPs. </p>
<p>
The Special Central Assistance (SCA) to the SCPs for SCs is an addition
to the state plans and programmes for SCs. It does not follow the systematic
pattern for special schemes. The states use this additional assistance from the
Centre for income-generating economic development schemes in conjunction
with the outlays in their SCPs so as to assist the economic advancement of the
maximum possible number of SCs families living below the poverty line. </p>
<p>
At present, the Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes
Sub— Plan (SCSP) is a ent al scheme under which 100 per cent grant is given to
the states/ UTs as an additive to their own SCSP. The main objective is to give </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000206">206</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:206
</h1>
<p>
a thrust to family-oriented schemes of economic development of SCs below
the poverty line, by providing resources for filling the critical gaps and for
providing missing vital inputs so that the schemes can be more meaningful.
Since the schemes/ programmes for SCs may be depending upon the local
occupational pattern and the economic activities available, the sates/ UTs have
been given full flexibility in utilizing SCA with the only condition that it
should be utilized in conjunction with SCP and other resources available from
other sources like various corporations, financial institutions etc. State
governments have also been given flexibility in choice of schemes to be imple-
mented out of SCA, within the overall framework of the scheme. According
to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India,
the funds released to states/ UTs from 2007—08 to 2013—14 are shown below:  </p>

The Scheduled Caste Development Corporations (SCDCs) in the states
are envisaged to interface between the SC families and financial institutions in
respect of bankable schemes of economic development. The corporations
provide money, loan assistance to these families, thereby helping to increase
the flow of funds from financial institutions to SC families. At present, such
coporations are working in 27 states/ union territories. Grants are given by
the central government to the state governments for investment in the share
capital of the corporations in the ratio of 49: 51. The SCDCs finance the
employment-oriented schemes covering diverse areas of economic activities,
which inter alia include (i) agriculture and allied activities including minor
irrigation (ii) small-scale industry; (iii) transport; and (iv) trade and service
sector. According the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment,
Government of India, the share capital assistance provided to the SCDCs
during the last five years and the number of beneficiaries are as under: </p>

<h1> Crimes Against Scheduled Castes </h1>
<p>
The reports of the National Commission on Scheduled Castes have every
year reflected an increase in the number of crimes against the SCs. Most of the
SC women are the victims of rape by upper caste men. The SC men, on the
other hand, are exploited by upper castes by usurping their lands, giving them
low wages, using them as bonded labour, and so forth. For checking this
exploitation, a set of comprehensive guidelines covering preventive measures
have been formulated and communicated by the central government to the
states for necessary action. Some of the measures taken by the states in this
connection are: </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000208">208</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:208
</h1>
<p>
0 Gearing up machinery for apprising the government of disputes of
land, wages, etc. concerning the SCs.

0 Helping the SCs in getting possession of lands belonging to them or
allotted to them.

0 Specially instructing police authorities to intervene in instances of
criminal trespass into lands belonging to SCs. The police is instructed
to treat cases of crime against SCs as special report cases and arrange
for quick trial and prosecution.

0 Helping agricultural labourers in getting statutory minimum wages.

0Setting up special courts (in some states) for ensuring quick disposal
of cases pertaining to SCs.

0 Instructing officers to spend a part of their time, when on a tour, in
residential areas of SCs.

0 Setting up special Scheduled Caste Cells under DIG Police to ensure
that crimes against SCs are properly registered, promptly investigated
and expeditiously prosecuted.

0 Setting up state level committees under the chairmanship of the Chief </p>
<p>
    Ministers to look after various aspects concerning welfare of SCs.
The incidence in the number of crimes against the SCs is evident from
the fact that as against only 180 cases registered with the police in 1955, the
number of cases increased to 509 in 1960, to 18,336 in 1991, to 24,922 in 1992,
to 24,973 in 1993 to 33,908 in 1994 (Crime in India, 1994:247). However, the
year 2012 witnessed a marginal decrease in comparison to previous year. As
against the 33,719 cases reported in the year 2011, the total number of cases in
2012 was 33,655.</p>
<p>
  This decrease has been observed in all heads except rape, arson and POA
Act. The cases in the year 2012 under these three heads have increased by 1.2
per cent, 26.6 per cent and 10.9 per cent respectively over the year 2011. On
the other hand, murder, kidnapping and abduction, dacoity, robbery, hurt
and Protection of Civil Rights Act have shown a decrease of 3.3 per cent, 20.5
per cent, 25 per cent, 25.9 per cent, 9.2 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively
during the year 2012 over the year 2011. Uttar Pradesh has accounted for
18.4%(6,202 cases) of the total 33,655 cases reported in the country, followed
by Rajasthan (16.5% or 5,559 cases), Bihar (14.3% or 4,821 cases) and Andhra
Pradesh (9.1% or 3,057 cases) (Crime in India, 2012: 109).  </p>
<p>
     The rate of crime against the SCs is observed as 16.7 during the year
2012.Rajasthan has reported the highest crime rate of 45.5, followed by Goa
(39.3), Odisha (31.5), Bihar (29.1) and Kerala (26.7) against the national average
of 16.7   </p>

<h1>
Evaluation of Welfare Schemes,Page no:209
</h1>
<p>
It is believed that in spite of a large number of welfare schemes for SC people
only a little progress has been in the last six decades. There has been a quality
of ritualistic formalism about many welfare and development schemes formu-
lated for these people. The financial incentives and educational reservation
have bestowed little real benefit to them. The quality of education has been
described as unrelated to their lifestyle and questioned. No efforts have been
made to induct them into the new ethos of learning and to inculcate in these
verbal and non-verbal skills that are a pre—condition to academic success. The
dropout rate at the school and college/ university levels has assumed alarming
proportions. Though their percentage of attendance remains very low, they
are permitted to appear in examinations, thanks to the policy of the
government to withdraw the percentage of compulsory attendance. That the
quality of their education is poor is evident in their performance at the
entrance tests for professional courses. As is seen in many cases that  despite
doing away with cut-off marks for reserved seats to facilitate filling up the
seats reserved for these categories, only a few students are able to quality at the
entrance tests for professional courses. </p>

            <h1> Other Backward Castes/ Classes </h1>
<p>
The Mandal Report
The provision for reservation for the SCs and STs was made in the Indian
Constitution framed after independence but the reservation for other
backward castes/ classes (OBCs) was announced by the Janata Dal
government only on August 7,1990. As many as 27 per cent seats were
proposed to be reserved for 3,742 OBCs. This was done in accordance with
implementing the Mandal Commission’s report. This Commission has
submitted itS report on December 31, 1980. It was discussed both by the Lok
Sabha and the Rajya Sabha in 1982 and thereafter the matter was remitted to
Committee of Secretaries for examination. The matter was repeatedly talk
up in both the Houses of Parliament but no action was taken. The sudden
announcement of accepting its recommendations in August 1990 were
described as a political gimmick of the then Prime Minister V.P. Singh, talk
without an in-depth study of the various issues arising out of its implemen
tation and also without verifying the correctness and validity of the selection
of castes and the indicators. </p>
<p>
    What were the criteria used by the Mandal Commission for identifying
specific caste/ class as 'backward'? The Commission used three indicators: social
educational, and economic. With regards to social indicators there were from  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000210">210</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:210
</h1>
<p>
criteria, for the educational indicators there were three criteria, and for the
economic indicators there were four criteria. Thus, in all, there were 11 criteria. </p>
<p>
The four social criteria were: (i) castes/ classes which are considered as
socially backward by others, (ii) casts/ classes which mainly depend on manual
labour for their livelihood, (iii) castes/ classes where at least 25 per cent
females and 10 per cent males above the state average get married at 17
years in rural areas and at least 10 per cent females and 5 per cent males do
so in urban areas, and (iv) castes/ classes where participation of females in
work is at least 25 per cent above the state average. </p>
<p>
The three educational criteria were: (i) castes/ classes where the number
of children in the age group of 5—15 years who never attended school is at least
25 per cent above the state average, (ii) castes/ classes where the rate of student
dropouts in the age group of 5—15 years is at least 25 per cent above the state
average, and (iii) castes/ classes amongst whom the proportion of
non-matriculates is at least 25 per cent above the state average. </p>
<p>
The four economic criteria were: (i) castes/ classes where the average
value of family assets is at least 25 per cent below the state average, (ii)
castes/ classes where the number of families living in kutcha houses is at least
25 per cent above the state average, (iii) castes/ classes where the source of
drinking water is beyond half a kilometre for more than 50 per cent of house-
holds, and (iv) castes/ classes where the number of households having taken
loan is at least 25 per cent above the state average. </p>
<p>
The weightage that was given to each indicator was arbitrary and
illogical. The social indicators were given a weightage of three points, the
educational indicators two points and the economic indicators were accorded
one point. The total value was 22 points. Castes which secured the score of 50
per cent, that is, 11 points or above, were listed as ‘backward’. </p>
<p>
   The government’s decision to implement the Mandal Commission’s
report on reservations for the backward castes provoked widespread
resentment among students. Spontaneous agitations erupted all over the
country. Most families endure hardship and sacrifice to educate their children.
The prospects of gainful employment already remain bleak because of the vast
unemployment in our country. Most students are haunted by the nightmare
of unemployment or of underemployment. In such a situation the govern-
ment’s ‘electoral’ decision to reserve jobs on the basis of caste for an additional
27 per cent to the existing quota of reservation of 22.5 per cent for SCs and
Sts, was bound to create frustration among the youth. </p>
<p>
Earlier, the Minorities Commission headed by M. S. Beg had cautioned in
the report against granting of recognition to backward classes as recommended
by the Mandal Commission. When the Janata Dal government announced its  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000211">211</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:211
</h1>
<p>
decision to implement the Mandal Commission’s report, no political party
openly opposed it. The parties adopted an ambiguous stance, though major
political parties gave implicit or overt support to the report with the stipulation
that it should be based on economic need rather than on caste. It was only the
National Front government which remained adamant that the Mandal Report
could not be diluted in any circumstances. As a sop, it offered 5 per cent to 10
per cent reservation in government jobs on an economic basis in addition to the
27 per cent proposed by Mandal Commission. However, it is now a
well-known fact that the National Front also was riven by internal dissension
on the Mandal Commission’s report issue. </p>
<p>
   Challenging the true purpose of the government in accepting the
Mandal Commission’s report, the students went on a rampage and took to
agitations and immolations. Between 19 September 1990 (when the first case
of self-immolation of a third year student was reported from a Delhi College)
and 16 October 1990, 160 youth had attempted to commit suicide against the
government’s decision to implement the recommendations of the Mandal
Commission. All of them were below the age of 25 and most of them were
either students studying in schools and colleges or were unemployed (Sunday,
November 4—10, 1990: 39). A large number chose to set themselves on fire in
full public view while some took poison or quietly burnt themselves to death.
There were 17 self-immolation attempts in these 26 days in Delhi, followed by
similar attempts in places like Hoshiarpur in Punjab, Jaunpur and Lucknow
in Uttar Pradesh, Kota in Rajasthan and Patna in Bihar. In almost all the cases,
the victims came from the lower-middle class families. The elite and the poor
were, however, not hit by the anti-Mandal wave. In all cases, the students left
behind melodramatic and vitriolic suicide notes. Some students were killed in
police firing at various places; many were injured, while thousands were
arrested. The students also damaged thousands of government vehicles,
private buses, cars and trains. The total loss was estimated to be worth several
crores of rupees. There was a sense of frustration and anger at the system, a
feeling that the system had given them the false hope that education would
give them better jobs, and thus, a better future. </p>

<h1> Arguments in Favour of Mandal Report </h1>
<p>
The following arguments were given in favour of the Mandal Commission’s
recommendations:

0 These fulfil the mandatory requirement of the Constitution (Articles
15,16 and 46) of satisfying those sections of society who have been
simmering with discontent for decades. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000212">212</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:212
</h1>
<p>
0 It is our moral and social duty to ensure that the oppressed and the
suppressed people are at par with the affluent people in society. The
underprivileged people need to be instilled with a sense of confidence. </p>
<p>
0 The reservation will be only for the central government services (the
state governments have their separate laws) and not more than 1 per
cent of the total population of the country are in these services. Of
that 1 per cent, 27 per cent has been reserved for the backward classes.
Therefore, the reservation will not adversely affect mass people. </p>
<p>
0 The recommendations are not based on caste as is wrongly
believed by most people. For example, the Rajputs in Bihar are not
included in the list but the Rajputs in Gujarat are included; the
Patels of Bihar are in the list but Patels of Gujarat are not; and the
Yadavas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are included but Yadavas in
Haryana are not. Thus, the basis is the situation of a particular
caste in each state. </p>
<p>
0 Nation’s SC, ST and other backward class population with 52 per
cent strength has altogether a mere 4 per cent representation in Class I
government and public sector employment. This is utter injustice to
the weaker sections which needs to be corrected. </p>
<p>
0 One argument given by the anti-reservationists against increasing
reservation is based on the question of ‘merit’. Here, the
assumption is that merit resides with the high castes who,
therefore, must be allowed according to the colonial fashion, to
continue to bear the burden both of running the state and its
services and of civilizing the low castes. Is this argument valid and
justified? Is this not the argument supported by the British
government while giving higher posts to the Britishers and lower
posts to the Indians? Was not the Britishers’ reluctance to grant
self—government to India based on a similar argument? Did we
accept that? If we had described that argument as fallacious at that
time, how can we accept a similar argument against the lower
castes and classes today? Further, if it is argued that employment in
this country has all along taken place on the basis of ‘merit’, have
we offered concrete opportunities to the deprived low castes to
acquire merit? If our state places every citizen on an equal footing,
denying equal opportunity to the backward groups is nothing but
Continuing dominance of the oppressed. Extending reservations to
these oppressed and the underprivileged people, therefore, calls for
much soul-searching, something that many of us seem instinctively
to resist. </p>

<h1>
Arguments Against Mandal Report, Page no:213
</h1>
<p>
  The Mandal Commission’s report elicited severe criticism from several
quarters on various scores. Five major arguments against it were: (i) the
criteria used for defining the other backward castes/ classes, (ii) using very old
census data for making population projections on the basis of an assumed
constant rate of population growth, (iii) bungling of facts and figures related to
the identification of the other backward castes/classes, (iv) non-objective
sampling procedure and lacunae in the data collected, and (v) the termino-
logical discrepancies specifically with reference to the use of terms like ‘caste’
and ‘class’. We can elaborate these arguments as below:  </p>
<p>
1. The ‘backwardness’ has been defined only on caste basis. This is to
perpetuate the abominable and disgusting caste prejudices and discrimi-
nations endemic to the (caste) system. Any special provisions should be
meant for all the poor irrespective of their caste and based only on
economic criterion. Besides using only one criterion of ‘caste’ to locate
the other backward castes/ classes underscores the importance of
multiple criteria—religion, income, occupation, and residence in a
locality—stressed by many scholars. </p>
<p>
2. Though great pains were taken to define ‘caste’, no definition of ‘class’
was provided and sociologically speaking, caste and class are two distinct
categories. Hence, the Mandal Commission’s report at best located
‘Other Backward Castes’ and not ‘Other Backward Classes’ as required. </p>
<p>
3. The criterion used for identifying the other backward castes/ classes was
erratic, whimsical and politically motivated. It was not based on a
rigorous scientific method. The eleven criteria adopted by the Mandal
Commission to determine social, educational and economic
backwardness of caste/ class do not largely satisfy the characteristics of
good indicator. For example, the social indicator pertaining to the
criterion of early marriage is not wedded to any particular caste or class.
It is an age-old social evil prevalent in all castes or classes in general.
Hence, it should not have been taken as an indicator to distinguish the
castes or classes. Also, the social indicator relating to female participation
in work may be considered an economic indicator, as the females have to
work to augment their family incomes. Moreover, it is also a general
tendency among the rural women to assist their family in agricultural
operations and this is not related to any particular caste or class. </p>
<p>
Similarly, a person was to be treated as ‘educationally backward’ if
neither his father nor his grandfather had studied beyond the primary
level. He was to be treated as ‘socially backward’ if (in the case of Hindu)
he did not belong to any of the three twice-born (dwij) ‘Varnas’, that is, </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000214">214</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:214
</h1>
<p>
he was neither a Brahmin, nor a Kshatriya nor a Vaishya, and/ or (in the
case of a non-Hindu), he was a convert from those Hindu communities
which have been defined as socially backward, or his parental income
was below the prevalent poverty-line. Were these elaborate inquiries
really made? The evidence does not indicate this.
Most dejecting part was the selection of economic criteria, where per
capita family income was completely left out. Family assets and
consumption loans refer to families expenditure, depending upon
whether they are big or small families, or they are prone to following
social traditions and incurring loans often.
Lastly, the economic indicator where the source of drinking water was
taken into consideration is related to an exogenous factor not at all
related to any particular caste or class. Thus, since the identification of
the backwardness of castes/ classes was not based on correct indicators,
efforts to expand reservation cannot have any acceptability. </p>
<p>
4. The definition and identification of ‘backward’ class is unscientific.
When the Mandal Commission identified 3,742 classes as ‘backward’,
the first Backward Classes Kalelkar Committee had identified
somewhere around 2,000 and odd. Either, the identification by the
Kalelkar Committee was not correct or there had been a scramble after-
wards by a large number of other communities to get themselves
classified as backward classes in order to get benefits. Or, the other
inference could be that a number of communities became ‘backward’
after the Kalelkar Committee submitted its report. It was, therefore,
necessary to consult the state governments to identify the backward
classes. For example, when the Kerala government itself had identified
79 castes as backward, the Mandal Commission recommended 208 as
backward. Similarly, Odisha did not specify even one caste as backward
but the Mandal Commission identified 224. The Mandal Commission,
thus, did not consider it necessary to consult the state governments. </p>
<p>
5. The population projection of the categorization of castes was based on
the use of the 1931 census data. At that time, the social, economic and
demographic map of India was entirely different. ‘Caste’ was identified
on the basis of its traditional occupation. After 1931, the listing of castes
was discontinued in census operations, and many changes must have
taken place between 1931 and 1980 (when Mandal Commission
submitted its report) by the rapid increase in industrialization, urban-
ization, educational growth, migration and mobility. As such, the old
census basis adopted in 1980 by the Mandal Commission gives a totally
distorted picture of the criteria adopted. Land reforms made since </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000215">215</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:215
</h1>
<p>
independence have appreciably altered the social and educational status
of various castes and made them a significant part of the rural elite. The
Yadavas and the Kurmis in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the best
example. The Gujjars, the Koeris, and the Lodhs have also become
owner cultivators in some states.  </p>
<p>
The urban population had increased from 12 per cent in 1931 to about
24 per cent in 1981. In urban areas, the level of income and occupation
influences social status to a greater extent than position in the traditional
caste hierarchy. Change from a purely agricultural economy into one in
which manufacturing and service industries were becoming increasingly
important have also resulted in the decline of some rural occupations.
The Commission does not appear to have taken all these changes into
account in assuming the population of the other backward castes/ classes
in 1980 to be 52 per cent of that total. In 1990, when the government
decided to announce the acceptance of the Mandal Commission’s report,
urbanization had increased by another 4 per cent, and further changes
had occurred in the occupational distribution of the population making
figures and conditions based on 1931 census even more unrealistic.
In addition to urbanization and occupational changes, there has been
substantial growth even of higher education, the number of students in
universities and colleges increasing from 3.6 lakh in 1950—51 to 38.2 lakh
in 1978—79 and 56.43 lakh in 1989-90 (India 1992:83). The increase in
the number of SC/ ST students shows that the expansion of higher
education among these backward sections of population, undoubtedly
facilitated by the grant of stipends, had been more remarkable. The total
number of SC/ ST students receiving higher education in 1987-88 was
about 3.36 lakh in comparison to 4,000 in 1950—51. How could these
changes between 1931 and 1980, and between 1980 and 1990 be ignored?  </p>
<p>
6.Another false assumption made by Mandal Commission was that the
proportion of the other backward castes/ classes among the non-Hindus
was of the same order as the Hindus. The proportion of non-Hindu
other backward castes/ classes was taken as 8.40 per cent of the total
population or 52 per cent of their actual population, but the derived
figure of Hindu other backward castes/ classes as given by this report is
43.70 per cent and not 52 per cent. It is only when 8.40 per cent is added
to 43.70 per cent that the rounded total of 52 per cent is arrived at. The
figures 8.40 per cent and 52 per cent were both taken arbitrarily. This is a
fundamental methodological error of the report. </p>
<p>
How was the figure 43.70 per cent obtained? This figure was derived by
subtracting from the total population of Hindus (83.84%), the  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000216">216</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:216
</h1>
<p>
population of SC/ ST (22.56%) and that of forward Hindu communities
(17.58%). Working by this method, the figure obtained is 43.70 per cent.
This is a methodological fallacy. </p>
<p>
7. The sampling procedure used for the socio—educational field survey was
very defective. It involved the selection of two villages and one urban
block from each district. The objectivity of the sample chosen with only
1.0 per cent population coverage is highly questionable. </p>
<p>
8. In determining the criteria for backwardness, the importance given to
economic criteria was utterly inadequate. Of the 22 points set by the
Mandal Commission for the classification of castes/ classes as ‘backward’,
only four points were given to economic criteria. This shows that the
‘backwardness’ of class was decided upon without much regard for the
economic position of the group. </p>
<p>
9.The Indian Constitution has not defined ‘backward class’ but it provides
for appointment of a commission “to investigate the conditions of
backward classes”. It does not make it mandatory that the government
should ask the commission to identify the backward classes. The
Chairman of the Mandal Commission, being himself a member of a
backward caste and famous for his biased utterances during his political
career, had played a biased role in identifying the indicators and
assigning scores to them for identifying the backward castes/ classes.
Since a thorough investigation and survey was not made and proper
criterion was not applied, the Mandal Commission’s mandate to select
the castes/ classes cannot be accepted. Even the Commission itself had
confessed that its listing of classes as socially and educationally backward
was “somewhat arbitrary and had the merit only of a tenable viewpoint
and no more”. </p>
<p>
10. How was the constant rate of population growth assumed and the
percentage adopted? How was 27 per cent fixed straight away? The
government is expected to give consideration to the totality of reserva-
tions, including the SCs, STs, handicapped persons, ex—servicemen,
displaced persons, and other special categories, which when added to 27
per cent recommended by the Mandal Commission goes beyond 59 per
cent. The remaining percentage left open is so small that the students and
the youth belonging to this section are bound to react and agitate partic-
ularly because these reservations act as barricades to a gainful
employment. </p>
<p>
11.The Mandal Commission report was kept lying in the limbo for ten years.
When any report is dug out after such a long time, it should be updated
and examined in terms of the altered needs and its lacunae, and evaluated </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000217">217</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
in terms of its effects of acceptance. This is done in a given time-frame.
The government that announced the acceptance of Mandal Commission’s
report never bothered to go through this process, with the result that with
its lacunae loud and obvious, it led to violence and agitations. </p>
<p>
12. The Constitution lays down that a class cannot be categorized as
backward when it is adequately represented in the services under the
state. This task is not an easy one as statistical details are not available on
this aspect, except a confused set of figures compiled on the basis of the
lists of backward classes in some states. </p>
<p>
13. One consequence that will follow the Mandal Commission’s report’s
implementation will be that since the Mandal Commission’s report does
not divide the reservation of 27 per cent further into quotas for each of
the backward castes, the bulk of the 27 per cent reservations will be
hogged by a few castes that are more dominant among the backward
castes. Even among these few dominant castes again, it will be a few
families which will prosper at the cost of their unfortunate brethren.
This has been our experience with the reservation policies implemented
earlier for the SCs and STs. There is no limit in the Mandal Commis-
sion’s report on the number of members from one family who might
benefit from reservation. Nor is there any economic criterion to prevent
even the most affluent member of the concerned caste from availing of
the reservation quota. </p>
<p>
The question whether adequate representation is to be taken with
reference to each one of the categorized backward classes is important. If the
totality of backward classes is taken into consideration and it is found that a
few groups have monopolized the posts to go beyond adequate representation
(as is the case of Meena tribe in North India or some castes in southern states),
would there be social justice? If individual groups are taken and caste forms
the basis of selection, is it possible to keep a roster for 3,500 castes which may
be constantly fluctuating in the representation in services? These things
should have been tackled first before talking of social justice. </p>
<p>
Some other arguments given against the Mandal Commission’s report
were: </p>
<p>
1. The manner of its implementation was too hasty. The people should
have been prepared for its implementation as it was likely to give a
feeling of deprivation to some sections. Even within the party, there was
no discussion on the report. Other constituents of the National Front.
government were also kept in the dark by the Janata Dal. The report
was, thus, implemented without any consensus. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000218">218</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:218
</h1>
<p>
2. While reserving the quota for the backward classes, the economic cut off
point has not been fixed. A family with an income above a certain level
should not have been entitled to reservation. </p>
<p>
3. The administrative efficiency has been imperiled in the name of conces-
sions to backward classes. Even the Constitution maintains that the
reservation shall be consistent with and not subversive to the mainte-
nance of efficiency of the administration. </p>
<p>
4. Reservation should have been valid only for one generation. </p>
<p>
    Thus, an unscientific study based on assumptions, fallacies, paucity of
relevant data, loopholes in information, arbitrariness, subjectivity, anomalies,
a high degree of generalization, and which goes against the expert social scien-
tists’ advice, needs to be treated with extreme caution. </p>
<p>
   Jolted by the scale and intensity of the agitation, immolation cases of
students and the criticism by the political parties, the press and people against
the thoughtless acceptance of the Mandal Commission’s report, the
government came out with some proposals to defuse the crisis. It was
announced (in October 1990) that reservations would not be applied to
education and to vital sectors like science, defence and top jobs. Nor would
there be reservations in promotions. The report would also be not applicable
to those states (like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa/ Odisha and West
Bengal) which had rejected the Mandal Commission’s report. </p>
<p>
    When the Narasimha Rao’s government came into power in July 1991,
it proposed on September 25, 1991 that within 27 per cent of the union
government civilian jobs reserved for the Socially and Educationally
Backward Classes (SEBCs), preference would be given to the ‘poor sections’
of such classes. As many as 10 per cent of these jobs would be reserved for
"other economically backward sections” of the people who are not covered
by any of the existing schemes of reservation. </p>
<p>
   The reservation issue, based on V. P. Singh government’s notification of
August 12,1990 and Narasimha Rao government’s notification of September
25,1991 was referred to the Supreme Court which gave its verdict on
November 15, 1992. The majority judgement (of six justices against the
minority judgement of three justices) held that reservations in government
service on the basis of caste are permissible (though discrimination against any
citizen on the ground of caste in respect of any employment is prohibited).
The apex court accepted the policy of 27 per cent reservation for the
backward castes/ classes, though it gave certain directions for change in this
policy. One, that ‘creamy layer’ of backward castes/ classes should be
excluded. Two, armed forces and sensitive higher civilian posts (like scientists,
university professors, pilots, etc.) should be kept outside the purview of caste   </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000219">219</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
reservations. Three, while Mandal Commission had identified 3,743
backward castes/ classes (OBCs), the Supreme Court recognized only half this
number as OBCs, as identified earlier by various state governments. It also
held that those castes which were adequately represented in government. It also
should be excluded from the list (of OBCs). Four, while Mandal Commission
wanted to carry forward such vacancies which remained unfulfilled, the
Supreme Court gave direction for treating such vacancies as unreserved. The
Court thus emphasized on maintaining ‘minimum standard’ in filling the
posts. Five, while Mandal Commission was in favour of reservation in
‘promotions’ too, the Supreme Court recommended reservations only in
original appointments. Six, the Supreme Court declared the reservation of 10
per cent seats for the weaker sections in the higher castes (as announced by
Narasimha Rao government) as unconstitutional. Lastly, the Supreme Court
directed that the reservation quota should not go beyond 50 per cent. </p>
<p>
Besides these directions, the Supreme Court also gave following four
directions to the central government: (a) the Government of India should
specify within four months the basis of exclusion of the ‘creamy layer”; (b)
the inclusion or exclusion of a caste or a section of a caste would have to be
periodically reviewed to take care of changing circumstances; (c)
permanent commissions should be appointed within four months by the
central government as well as state governments to decide regularly the cases
which should arise involving questions whether a particular caste or a section
of a caste was rightly included or excluded.  </p>
<p>
   Accepting the Supreme Court’s verdict, the union government imple-
mented from September 8, 1993 the reservation of 27 per cent quota for 1,130
backward castes/ classes in central services and public undertakings. The first
appointment of an OBC candidate was made on February 20, 1994. The
creamy layer was kept out of the quota as directed by the Supreme Court and
high posts in the creamy layer (like President and Vice-President of India
Supreme Court and High Court judges, class I officers, members of PSCs
CEC, CAG, and wards of officers working in the World Bank or in interna-
tional organizations, etc.) were also identified. However, political posts (like)
Prime Minister, Union Ministers, Chief Ministers, ministers in states, and
MPs, MLAs and MLCs) were not included in the creamy layer category. The
officers working in public sector undertakings, or professionals like doctors,
lawyers, chartered accountants, income-tax consultants, architects, and
computer specialists whose annual income was more than Rs one lakh were
also included in the ‘creamy layer’.  </p>
<p>
In a notification issued by the government on October 22, 1993, it was
stated that the ‘concessions’ permitted to SCs/STs are not ‘admissible’ to the </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000220">220</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:220
</h1>
<p>
OBCs. These concessions are; relaxation of minimum standards, upper age
limit, permitted number of attempts, and stipulated experience. This is expected
to safeguard merit in the government service. Further, a candidate seeking
employment under the OBC quota has to produce a certificate from a gazetted
officer that he does not belong to the creamy layer. The certificate is issued on
the basis of the candidate’s answers to a detailed questionnaire which goes into
all the criteria laid down for identifying the creamy layer. The certificate also
has to show that the candidate belongs to one of the 1,238 OBCs short-listed by
the Centre in a notification. These names are common to the Mandal Commis-
sion’s report and list of the fourteen states where OBC reservations have been
in existence. The October 1993 notification, however, says that the ‘carry
forward’ facility will continue (India Today, December 15, 1993).  </p>
<p>
The Bihar government defined ‘creamy layer’ in an interesting way. As
per this definition, those persons have been precluded from reservation who
are wards of industrialists whose units have an investment of Rs 10 crore or
more and which have been in operation for at least five years and whose
spouses are at least graduates and the family owns immovable property
(house) worth at least Rs 20 lakh. Among the government servants, those have
been included in the ‘creamy layer’ who are directly recruited class I officers,
drawing a salary of Rs 10,000 or more per month and whose spouses are
graduates and who own a house in an urban area. The sons and daughters of
professionals, such as doctors, advocates, chartered accountants, tax consul—
tants, financial consultants, architects have been included in the ‘creamy layer’
whose average income for three consecutive financial years is not less than Rs
ten lakh per annum and whose spouses are at least graduates and whose
families own immovable property worth at least Rs 10 lakh. The Supreme
Court in its verdict delivered in August 1995 rejected this criteria of ‘creamy
layer’ as given by two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Kerala govern-
ments move to nullify the ‘creamy layer’ rule was also quashed by the apex
court (India Today, September, 30, 1995: 31).  </p>
<p>
The state of Uttar Pradesh faced a typical problem of anti-reservation
agitation in September-November 1994. The OBCs in the hill region (Tehri
Garwal) in the state constitute merely 2 per cent of the hill population.
When 27 per cent reservation quota was announced for the OBCs by the state
government in 1994, the hill people started agitation. How can 27 per cent of
the seats be reserved for 2 per cent of the population? The state government’s
argument was that there cannot be special laws for a part of the same state.
The hill people, therefore, started agitation in September 1994 for a separate
hill state, called Uttarakhand. Hundreds of people were killed and arrested,
educational institutions remained closed for about four months, government   </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000221">221</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:221
</h1>
<p>
  offices (including post offices) and banks did not work for more than a month.
The state government recommended to the central government the creation
of a separate hill state. Eventually, the agitation died down as all agitations do.
However, the then Prime Minister Deve Gowda made an announcement in
August 1996 that Uttarakhand state would soon be created; but this
announcement has been criticized/ challenged by many political parties.  </p>
<p>
No time limit of reservation (like 10 or 20 years) for OBCs has been
fixed in the union government’s declaration, as it is fixed or extended for
SCs/STs from time to time. The National Backward Classes Commission was
constituted on August 14, 1993. Such commissions have been established by
state governments also (though Maharashtra government disbanded the State
Minority Commission in June 1995) except those (like, Jammu and Kashmir,
Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, etc.) where no reservation exists for any
category of people. The National Backward Classes Finance and Devel-
opment Corporation was also set up on June 13, 1992 with a share capital of
Rs. 2,000 crore for giving loans to OBC members below the poverty line. </p>
<p>
What is significant today is that in fixing the quota, many state govern-
ments have gone beyond the maximum limit of 50 per cent, as directed by the
Supreme Court. In 1994, Tamil Nadu enhanced the quota to 69 per cent and
Karnataka increased it from 68 to 73 per cent. (The Supreme Court, however
stayed Karnataka’s  October 1994 enactment on October 28,1994).The
announcements of two states have emboldened Bihar and Andhra Pradesh to
announce the intention of reserving 80 per cent seats for SCs/ STs/ OBCs.
Uttar Pradesh wants to take the reservation quota to 62 per cent. Further,
against the directions of the Supreme Court, the parliament even passed the
86th Constitution Amendment Bill in May 1995 securing reservation in
promotions for the SCs/STs in government employment. The government
has promised to enact legislation for reservation in ”promotions for
employees from OBCs too. If this trend is carried to its logical conclusion, we
will be heading for separate quotas for each caste and even sub-caste. </p>
 <p>
The reservation quota system is, thus, being abused in a number of ways.
For example, (i) SC/ ST lists have been lengthened by the Centre on 20
occasions. (ii) At least two states have exceeded the 50 per cent limit of total
reservations fixed by the Supreme Court and more threaten to follow suit. (iii)
Creamy layer rule mandated for OBC reservations is being disregarded by the
states. (iv) Reservations have been extended even to some advanced castes (for
example, Vokkaligas and Lingayats in Karnataka. (v ) Some states (likee
Madhya Pradesh) have scrapped cut-off marks for SCs and STs in entrance
tests to professional courses. (vi) Officials in some states (like Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar) manipulate recruitment processes to favour OBCs or dalits. (vii) </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000222">222</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:222
</h1>
<p>
Some intermediate castes have been given the status of tribes and Scheduled
Castes to achieve political benefits. For example, Meenas in Rajasthan (who
were equal in rank to the Jats of Uttar Pradesh) were included in the ST list by
the Chief Minister of Rajasthan in 1957 in return for the support extended by
13 Meena MLAs in his election as the party leader. Similarly, the Bedars, an
advanced community in Karnataka, started calling themselves Nayakas
sometime in the late 1970s and got themselves included in the ST list in 1981
census report, with the result that ST population in Karnataka increased by
nine times in 1981 in comparison to 1971 figure. They were officially given
the status of ST by the parliament in August 1991. An illegality thus acquired
constitutional sanctity. (viii) While till now, reservations were caste-based,
some vote- hungry politicians, both at the central and state levels, have now
suggested reservation on religious minority basis which is totally against the
provisions of our Constitution. Some Chief Ministers promised reservations
to Muslims for getting their votes at the time of assembly elections in four
states in December 1994. For example, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister
promised 15 per cent reservation for Muslims, Bihar Chief Minister 10 per
cent, Assam Chief Minister 24 per cent, and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
chief Ministers 27 per cent (India Today, November 30, 1994: 85). Though
some apolitical sectarian leaders of the 120 million-strong Muslim community
have favoured reservations, some Muslim reformists have described it as only
false promises to appease the minority community. Some Muslims intellec-
tuals have opposed the idea of reservation for Muslims. But none of these
promises have been implemented in any state so far, for not only many
non-Muslim leaders have not endorsed the demand but a large section of
People have also resisted such a move and described it as being against the
interest of a multireligious society. </p>
<p>
Thus, being abused by politicians, reservation system has been perverted
and often it works against and hurts those they were intended to help. </p>

<h1>  The Reservation Policy </h1>
<p>
Implementation of Mandal Commission’s recommendations in August 1990,
the Supreme Court’s judgment on this issue in November 1992, raising of
reservation quota to 69 per cent and even to 80 per cent in some states in 1994,
and the amendment of Constitution by the parliament in May 1995 to extend
reservation even to ‘promotion’ cases (against the directions of the Supreme
Court) Will always be sadly referred to by the future historians in failing to
establish an egalitarian system in India. All these measures have resulted into
such situations whose consequences are bound to be disastrous. A few
important effects have been:(1) Casteism has been granted a fresh lease of life. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000223">223</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:223
</h1>
<p>
(2) Merit and calibre have been replaced by mediocrity. (3) Politicians
definition of ‘creamy layer’, excluding political posts from this category, and
the attempts to include more and more castes/ classes in the list of OBCs, have
changed the social and economic landscape beyond recognition. (4) Tremors
let off in some states for anti-reservation agitation have increased violence in
the society. (5) Migration of students and other people to those regions where
they have greater possibilities of getting job reservation benefits has increased.
(6) There is increase in discontent among people of advanced castes. Surpris-
ingly, the Supreme Court also accepted the idea of reservations in government
service on caste basis. Is the idea of reservation on caste basis not erroneous for
our country? Will it not leave the nation into two categories of
people—forward and backward—and open up new vistas for mutually
destructive conflicts and fissiparous forces and make backwardness a vested
interest? Will it ensure real social Justice in society? Will it create an egalitarian
system? Will it develop a cohesive and an integrated society?  </p>
<p>
The demand for special concessions and privileges to the underprivileged
are matters of right and not of charity or philanthropy. All the commissions
and the committees that have examined this issue, like the Miller Committee
appointed by the erstwhile Mysore state or the Kalelkar Commission
appointed by the Government of India, have accepted the need for compen-
satory discrimination to a certain limit. Some of the courts also in hearing the
cases that have come up before them have examined the issue. One judge
pointed out that the reservation policy has generated a spirit of
self- denigration, each caste and community competing to be more backward
than others. In another case, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
(Shri Chandrachud) had directed that the reservation policy should be
reviewed every five years so that the state can rectify distortions and
people—both backward and non-backward—can ventilate their views in
public debates on the practical impact of the reservation policy. The question
to be discussed today, therefore, is: Is reservation policy, or protective discrim-
ination, a logical and useful strategy for ensuring justice and equal
opportunity to the economically exploited and socially oppressed groups?   </p>
<p>
The first argument is that reservation in educational institutions and
government jobs, by itself cannot achieve much. In fact, if extended to larger
sections of the population, they can be counter productive too. At best, reser-
vations are ‘palliatives’ and no decisive transformations can take place unless
such a measure is accompanied by structural changes in the nation’s
production relations, and most crucially, until land reforms become a reality,
and educational support systems are so buttressed that candidates from all
social groups are available for higher level jobs. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000224">224</pagenum>
<h1>
Page  no:224
</h1>
<p>
The second argument is that our country is already divided into various
groups. Reservation will further divide the population artificially. Earlier,
reservations were accepted under special conditions for a period of fifteen
years only, but continuing them for ever will produce vested interests and
separatism, and will lead to a caste-war and the disintegration of the country.
Sometime back, it was ordered that caste will not be mentioned in applica-
tions for jobs. But if the reservation policy is to be continued for SCs, STs and
OBCs, the applicants will have to mention their caste, otherwise how will
they be known? This will fragment the Hindu society into pieces.  </p>
<p>
The third argument is that when the reservation policy was imple-
mented after the independence, there were only a few SC and ST people in the
administrative set-up. Later on, Jagjivan Ram introduced reservations even in
promotions when he was the Railway Minister, so that the superiors were
passed over by their subordinates belonging to SCs and STs. This not only
politicized the civil services but also affected the efficiency of the adminis-
tration. Just as at the time of partition of the country, the Muslim members of
the administrative services were working for Pakistan and the non-Muslims
for India, similarly because of the reservation policy, most of the officers are
now working on the basis of caste and creed. If this goes on even for 10-15
years more, there will be total disruption. It is time that the beneficiaries and
society should reconsider the issue of reservations. The society should
immediately think of bringing about conditions where all jobs and admissions
are decided only on merit in an open competition, in which all aspirants are
assured of a fair chance.  </p>
<p>
The fourth argument is that our experience in the last 65 years has
shown that the reservation policy has not delivered the desired results. A
large number of SC and ST representatives in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas
have not been able to adequately articulate the grievances and needs of
people of their constituencies. Reservation in jobs and in educational institu-
tions has benefited only a few tribes and castes. The reservations have also
generatated conflicts and tensions. The seventies, the eighties and the first six
years of the nineties witnessed countrywide waves of violent protests.
Budgetary allocations earmarked for the development of the SCs and STs
were frittered away in non-essential projects that contributed little to the
process Of self— generating growth.  </p>
<p>
 There is another school of thought which favours reservations. The
supporters of this school maintain that there is a wide gulf between the social
order that people of India were promised by a political party led by Gandhiji,
and the one that has actually been established since Independence. The
oppression of the weaker sections of society (including lower and backward  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000225">225</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:225
</h1>
<p>
castes and tribes) by the stronger (upper castes) sections has not ended. In fact,
it has been aggravated. A new era of social justice and equality still remains a
dream to be achieved. The benefits of development have been appropriated by
about 20 per cent of the population at the top. The English— speaking educated
middle class has come to control and operate levers of state power. It has
emerged as the ruling class of the country. By accepting the reservation policy,
the government will only be working for the establishment of a new social
order that would secure to the underprivileged sectors of our society justice in
social relations and equality of opportunity to rise in social scale. </p>
<p>
    There is one school of thought which favours reservations but wants
economic need and not caste as the basis of reservation. Almost all political
parties, except the Janata Dal, implicitly or overtly have supported this idea of
reservation on the economic-need basis. They hold that this will help the
deserving poor of all classes and castes to rise in society. The disadvantaged
groups do need protection but it cannot be extended en masse and for all time
to come. The poor should get special weightage but a watchdog body should
keep an eye on their progress. As soon as it is found that they no longer need
the crutches of reservations, all jobs should be declared open to all.  </p>
<p>
Whatever may be the theoretical arguments against the reservation
policy, in practice reservation policy will continue to be supported by all
political parties because of the electoral mileage they derive from this issue.
The vote banks are more important to them than the future of the country.
Earlier politicians never bothered about such vote-banks. Even intellectuals
like B. R. Ambedkar were against the caste politics. In Ambedkar's words:
“Fraternity means a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians, of Indians
being one people. Castes are anti-national. They bring about separation in
social life and generate jealousy and antipathy between caste and caste. If we
wish to become a nation in reality, we must oppose caste feelings.” Kaka
Kalelkar also had written a letter forwarding his report to the President in
1955: “I am definitely against reservations in government services for any
community for the simple reason that the services are not meant for the
servants but they are meant for the service of society as a whole”. Never-
theless, Kalelkar’s report had listed 2,399 castes (against Mandal listing 3,743
castes) as backward, and the then government had rejected this list saying that
“if the entire community is regarded as backward, the really needy would hardly
receive any special attention or adequate assistance”. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
too had written a letter to Chief Ministers on June 27, 1961 saying, “I dislike
any kind of reservation, more particularly in service as it will lead to ineffi-
ciency and second-rate standards. The only real way to help a backward group
is to give opportunities for good education”. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000226">226</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
It will not be out of place here to refer to the desperate tale of a forward
caste woman in Kerala who, merely with a view to gaining admission for her
son in a medical college, deposed before a magistrate in the presence of her
husband that the son was her illegitimate offspring by a Harijan. Such ideas
and actions will result into disaster for the country. Public opinion needs to be
mobilized against the policy of reservation, and the government and the
politicians have to be made to realize that it is not in the national interest to
continue the system of caste quotas. A political party may get a few votes by
pursuing populist policies like caste reservation but such policies will only
replant the poisonous weed of casteism which will harm the country for
hundred years to come.  </p>
<p>
    Reservation among the SCs, STs and OBCs has led to the emergence of
the elite class which has been cornering the benefits of reservation for itself
and has become self-perpetuating. Time has come to introduce some changes
in the reservation policy. Some of these changes could be as follows: (1)
Safeguarding the true meaning of ‘reverse discrimination’ and applying the
principle in such a manner that the really deserving get the benefits and the
SCs ,STs and OBCs are protected from their own self-serving leaders. (2) No
state should be allowed to cross the limit of 50 per cent reservation. Those
states which have fixed quota more that this should be given a time-limit of
two-three years to fall in line and bring reservation quota to 50 per cent. (3)
We should incorporate the principle of limiting the benefit of reservations to
one generation only, i.e., if a person has taken advantage of reservations to get
a job, his children will not be entitled to the benefit of reservation. (4) There
should be no reservation in ‘promotions’. This would avoid conflicts between
junior reserved category employees and senior general category employees
and check heartburn and demoralization of people in the later category. (5)
All organizations must set minimum standards for recruitment at all levels. In
no case should the minimum standards be compromised. (6) A periodical
review of the list of backward castes is the need of the day so that those castes
may be delisted which have generally caught up with the so-called forward
ones. In Tamil Nadu, 34 castes out of 222 backward castes have cornered
about 75 per cent of the seats in three major professional courses. Further, in
this ‘creamy layer’ also, an elite group of eleven castes has bagged two-thirds
of the seats set apart for backward castes. This ‘creamy layer’ among the
backwards is also the ‘creamy layer’ in the emerging Tamil Nadu social order
(The Hindustan Times, July 7,1994).Will the continued retention of such
castes in the list of backward castes not be detrimental to the interests of large
majority of other backward castes?  </p>
<p>
While framing the Constitution of India, Ambedkar had suggested three
propositions: (i) there should be equality of opportunity for all citizens; (ii)
there ought to be no reservations of any sort for any class or community at all,  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000227">227</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:227
</h1>
<p>
i.e., all qualified persons should be placed on the same footing or equality so
far as the public services are Concerned; and (iii) there should be reservations for
a limited period in favour of certain communities which have so far been
outside the administration. These three seem to be the workable propositions
even today for our society, for social justice will be combined with some
semblance of merit. It 15 time that we tackled all problems of reservation?”
sanity and rationality. </p>
<p>
What are the youth to do then? The youth in India have to realize that
reservation of OBCs is not the only crucial problem to fight for or against.
The real problem is India’s political elite who work only for vested interests
and whose attitudes and obscurantist notions have corrupted the thinking of
our society and brought the country to its present critical condition. Instead
of fighting against the Mandal Commission’s report and challenging  those
present political leaders who, only because of being in power and having the
authority of getting laws enacted/ amended, talk of high and higher reser-
vation quota and even reservation for Muslims as well as in ‘promotions’ etc.
the youth have to fight the corrupt political system. If they want to protect
their future, if they want to be the future elite of the nation, they have to raise
their voice against the self-centred political leaders. They have to widen their
perspective to encompass the crucial problems of our society instead of
focusing on one aspect of reservation for backward castes/ classes etc. Instead
of raising the issue of forward versus backward castes, they should raise the
issue of vested interests of the political parties and leaders versus the logical
interests of society in general and youth in particular. They can propose
certain amendments in the reservation policy to ensure that instead of benefit
being drawn only by a few tribes, castes and OBC families, it should benefit a
large number of deserving people belonging to both the forward and the
backward castes. Second, there should be no compromise on quality and
efficiency. Third, they have to take the youth of the backward castes/classes
with them on this issue and be able to convince them of their stance. </p>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<p>
If weaker sections in India are to rise in revolt because they feel that only
violence facilitates their voice to be heard, the nation will have to pay a very
heavy price for this. Our government and our people have to give these docile
people the chance of a fair deal to live with honour and self-respect. Similarly,
little will be achieved by a debate on the pros and cons of reservations. It will
only aggravate the problem and lead to fragmentation of the country. The
power elite, the government, political parties and people have to delve deeper
into the very reasons why reservation has seemingly become necessary and
what needs to be done to eliminate this pernicious practice. </p>

Youth Unrest and Agitations
Page no:228
</h1>
<p>
Along with caste, religious and linguistic stereotypes, there exist many other
stereotyped images in our country. One such image is about our youth. The
stereotyped image is that youth are militant, rebellious, revolutionary,
irrational and undisciplined. It is true that the youth are vulnerable to outside
influences and imitate others but this does not mean that the youth only
believe in destruction, killing, assault and terrorism. When there is a total
disillusionment in society with the existing social structures and institutions,
with the contradictions in the social system, with the politics and the politi-
cians, with the decisions and decision-makers, and when everybody is
conscious of the falling standards in all walks of life, social discrimination,
prevailing corruption, and the search for quick monetary gains through
illegitimate means, why should the youth alone be expected to conform to
traditional moral values and lofty ideals? How can they look up to
self-proclaimed political, religious and social leaders for inspiration? </p>
<p>
The youth tend to become angry when they notice the widening chasm
between what the leaders preach and what they practise; when the leaders call
for sacrifice but they themselves loll in luxury; when the leaders talk of
morality but they themselves maintain liaison with smugglers, criminals and
anti-social elements; when they appeal for peace and harmony but they
themselves revel in factional squabbles, when they shed crocodile tears for the
poor but always live with and support the rich. Disappointed and disillu-
sioned by this, the frustrated youth start some agitation to lodge a social
protest .Some politicians start taking an interest in these agitations and in
some cases, they use the help of anti-social elements to keep these agitations </p>

<p>
alive. When these anti-social elements indulge in loot and arson, it is the youth
who come to be blamed for these destructive activities. The frustrated youth,
thus, become more frustrated and the unrest among them further increases.  </p>

<h1> Concept of Youth Unrest </h1>
<p>
What is unrest? What is social unrest? What is youth unrest? "Unrest  means
“disturbed condition”. It is “the state of disillusionment and dissatisfaction
Social unrest is the manifestation of collective disillusionment, discon-
tentment and frustration of the group, community or society. If there is
unrest among the students of one university, it is not perceived as the problem
of ‘student unrest’ as such. It is only when students all over the country feel
frustrated on common issues like admissions, content of courses, the exami-
nation system and the representations in academic bodies, can we say that
there exists the problem of student unrest in our society. Similarly, it is not
the unrest among the workers of one industry that is termed ‘industrial
unrest’ but it is the collective discontentment among all workers in different
industries in the country on issues of minimum wages, safety measures,
security of employment, and certain intra—mural and extra-mural facilities that
is referred to as the problem of ‘industrial unrest’. The same is true of the
peasant unrest, tribal unrest and women unrest. The emphasis in the concept
of social unrest is on “collective frustration and disillusionment on common
issues of the groups in the society”.  </p>
<p>
On this basis, youth unrest may be defined as the manifestation of
collective frustration of the youth in the society”. It is manifested when the
existing norms in the society are perceived by the youth as ineffective or
harmful to the extent that they offend them, and they feel so disillusioned and
disgusted that they recognize the need for changing these norms.   </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000230">230</pagenum>
<h1>
Characteristics of Youth Unrest, Page no:230
</h1>
<p>
On the basis of the above definition, it may be said that youth unrest is charac-
terized by (i) collective discontent, (ii) dysfunctional conditions, (iii) public
concern, and (iv) the need for change in the existing norms. </p>
<p>
    Youth agitation, on the other hand, is characterized by (i) action based
on the feeling of injustice, (ii) growth and spread of a generalized belief among
the youth which identifies the source of discontent, frustration and depri-
vation, (iii) emergence of leadership and mobilization for action, and (iv)
collective reaction to stimuli. </p>
<p>
     It will not be out of place to explain the concept of student indiscipline
at this stage. Indiscipline is disobedience to authority, or disrespect to elders,
or deviation from norms, or refusing to accept control, or rejecting goals
and/ or means. Student indiscipline leads to the ‘use’ of ‘undesirable methods’
by students. A committee appointed by the University Grants Commission
(UGC) in 1960 included three types of behaviour in student indiscipline: (i)
disrespect for teachers, (ii) misbehaviour with girls, and (iii) destroying
property. Further, it included the indiscipline of not a few students but of a
large group of students. Some scholars describe this definition as faulty. They
maintain that three situations create indiscipline among students: (a) Students
lose interest in the goals of the (educational) institution. In such a situation,
they remain members (of the institution) but do not follow its norms. (b)
Students accept the goals but doubt whether the institution can achieve them.
They, therefore, try to ‘improve’ the institution by deviating from its norms.
(c) Norms of institutions fail to achieve goals and students, therefore, want a
change in norms. </p>
<p>
Youth unrest may be viewed from three perspectives: (1) unrest among
youth ,(2) unrest due to the youth, and (3) social unrest in the country and its
effect on the youth. We will focus our discussion in this chapter on the first and
the third aspects, though in passing we may refer to the second aspect also. </p>

<h1> Youth Protests, Agitations and Movements </h1>
<p>
Social  protest is an expression of disapproval to something a person is
powerless to prevent or avoid. It is a mode of communicating discon-
tentment rather than direct action. It is an expression of outrage against
injustice. The important elements of social protest are: (i) action expresses
grievance, (ii) it points out to a conviction of injustice, (iii) protesters are
unable to correct the condition directly by their own effort, (iv) action is
meant to provoke ameliorative steps by the target group, and (v) protesters
bank upon the combination of coercion, persuasion, sympathy and fear to
move the target group. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000231">231</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:231
</h1>
<p>
If the protesters indulge in looting, it is not to acquire property; if they
indulge in breaking windows, it is not to seek vengeance; if they shout slogans
against a person, it is not to insult him. All these methods are resorted merely
to express resentment against their unfulfilled demands and towards the
callous attitude adopted by the powers that be in relation to their grievances. </p>

<h1> Youth Agitations </h1>
<p>
Social protest may lead to aggression, agitation and movement. Aggression is a
hostile act intended to harm or object, often the result of frustration. It is an
unprovoked attack. It is directed at the source of individual’s frustration
Myres (1988: 395) defines aggression as “physical or verbal behaviour that
hurts, harms or destroys”. This excludes accidental hurts or unintentional
hitting; but it certainly includes gossipy ‘digs’ about a person which hurt him.
Feshbach (1970) has given two types of aggression—hostile aggression, and
instrumental aggression. The former springs from anger and its goal is to
injure. It is resorted to as an end in itself. The latter also aims at hurting but
only as a means to some other end. The term ‘aggression’ is used more in
wars, while the term ‘agitation’ fits in more with the youth’s collective
behaviour, causing anxiety to persons, their minds or feelings. </p>
<p>
Agitation is “to bring grievance and injustice to the notice of people in
power”. It is to shake up, to move, to stir up, to cause anxiety, and to disturb
the power holders. Social movement is the activity of diffused collectivity
oriented towards changing the social order. According to Turner and Killian
(1972: 246), social movement is a collective behaviour based on some conti-
nuity to promote or resist change in society or group of which it is a part. It is
characterized by (i) collective action which is initiated, organized and
sustained, (ii) ideology, and (iii) orientation towards social change. A pressure
group is one that attempts to influence decision-makers or ‘governing elite’
for its own interests or the interests of a larger group that it represents. It
wants the existing norms to be interpreted to benefit it. In an agitation, there
is always a pressure group tactics but in a social movement, it may or may not
be there. The difference between an agitation and a social movement is that
social movement may take the form of agitation but every movement does
not do so. Many movements are peaceful, for example, women’s liberty
movement, the prohibition movement or the anti-nuclear movement. These
peaceful movements are the result of cultural drift. </p>
<p>
Youth agitation is the behaviour of the youth whose goal is neither
injury to a person nor destruction of public property but social protest. It is
neither the result of innate destructive drive nor it is an inborn reaction to
frustrations. It is a learned behaviour. Various forms of youth agitations are: </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000232">232</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:232
</h1>
<p>
demonstrations, slogan shouting, strikes, hunger strikes, road blocks (rasta
roko), gheraos and boycott of examinations. The preconditions for youth
agitations are: (i) structural strain, (ii) identifying the source of strain, (iii)
precipitating factor in initiative action, and (iv) mobilization of force for
action by a leader. The important functions of youth agitations are: (i) to
create collective consciousness and group solidarity, (ii) to organize the youth
to work for new programmes and new plans, and (iii) to provide opportu-
nities to young individuals to express their feelings and make some impact on
the course of social change.  </p>
<p>
Agitations could be violent or non-violent. In 1988, of the total incidents
of students’ agitations in India (5,338), only 18 per cent were violent, in
comparison to 15 per cent violent agitations in 1987, 43 per cent in 1986 and
19 per cent in 1985. Further, 56 per cent agitations (in 1988) related to
non-academic issues (within the campuses, like changing the name of the
university), 19 per cent to academic issues, and 25 per cent to some social
issues (reducing bus-fare, communal tension). In August and September 1990,
many universities/ colleges in North India faced the problem of students’
agitations on the reservation issue and remained closed for about two months.
Similar agitations took place in 1994 too in some parts of the country.   </p>
<p>
   Students’ agitations may be classified as: (i) student-oriented agitations,
and (b) society-oriented agitations. The former include problems at
college/ university level and at national level while the latter refer to taking
interest in state/ country's politics and policies and programmes.
Student -oriented agitations are generally discontinuous and problem-oriented
rather than value—oriented. For example, students will agitate for removal of a
particular vice-chancellor of a university but they will never fight for a change
in the system of selecting vice-chancellors in universities in India. Similarly,
they will fight to postpone examinations for a particular year but they will
not agitate for restructuring the examination system as such.  </p>

<h1>Process of Growth of Agitation Due to Youth Unrest </h1>
<p>
A lifecycle which many youth agitations follow can be explained. The stages
include: (1) the discontent stage, which is the stage of dissatisfaction and
growing confusion with the existing conditions; (2) the initiation stage, in
which a leader emerges, the causes of discontent are identified, excitement
increases and proposals for action are debated; (3) the formalization stage, in
which programmes are developed, alliances are forged, and support is also
sought of some crusaders; (4) the public support stage, in which youth trouble
is transferred into public trouble. This not only creates awareness among
public but also seeks public support on the concerned issue. Initially, the  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000233">233</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:233
</h1>
<p>
action starts in one area but then it spreads in other areas. The youth fail to get
the public support where (a) the claim is too vague, (b) the issue is incorrectively
focused, (c ) the issue is not powerful to gain attention, (d) ineffective strategies
are adopted by the youth for pressing claims, and (e) there is opposition from
other groups; and (5) official action stage in which the agencies in power
realize the importance of the issue, officially acknowledge the discontentment
and agree to adopt strategies to solve the issue. Sometimes, the strategy
adopted by the group in power is rejected by the youth leaders and the youth
start a movement to counter the strategies of people in power. </p>

<h1> Important Youth Agitations in India </h1>
<p>
After independence, a few important youth agitations may be cited in our
country which, though functional in their own way, had some tragic conse-
quences. These were: the anti-reservation agitation in Gujarat in 1985, the All
Assam Students Union agitation in Assam in 1984, the anti-Mandal agitation
in northern India in 1990 and agitation for Uttarakhand in Uttar Pradesh in
1994. This is apart from the role the youth played in the anti-reservation caste
riots in Gujarat in 1981, in terrorism in Punjab and Kashmir between 1985
and 1995, and in Jharkhand agitation in Bihar. </p>

<h1> Gujarat Agitation </h1>
<p>
The anti-reservation youth agitation in Gujarat in 1985 had started when,
following the recommendations of the Rane Commission (which was
appointed in April 1981 and had given its recommendations in October 1983),
the Government of Gujarat hastily enhanced the reservation quota in March
1985, just before the Assembly elections, for the students of the Socially and
Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs). The quota was increased from 10
per cent to 28 per cent, the maximum allowed by the Rane Commission. The
Rane Commission had laid emphasis on income and occupation rather than
caste as a criterion for backwardness, using Rs 10,000 a year as a yardstick. The
Gujarat government had already reserved 14 per cent seats for the STs, 7 per
cent for the SCs, 3 per cent for the handicapped, 1 per cent for the children of
the ex-servicemen and 10 per cent for the SEBCs. The increase of 18 per cent
more seats for the SEBCs meant a total reservation of 53 per cent seats in
colleges. Since 70 per cent of the state’s population (of 3.4 crore) was covered
by the reservation (of 53% seats), it meant that only 47 per cent seats were
open to the 30 per cent population of the state. Further, out of every 100 seats
in colleges, 30 seats were reserved for other states. Adding these 30 seats to the
39 reserved seats for STs, SCs and the SEBCs (out of every 100 seats) meaning
that only 31 seats were available to rest of the students. Naturally, the student </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000234">234</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:234
</h1>
<p>
reacted, and started an anti-reservation agitation. Unfortunately, the peaceful
Gujarat bandh organized by the students on March 18,1985, was followed by
Hindu-Muslim clashes on March 19, 1985 when the Muslims refused to join
the anti-reservationists against the Dalits. When six student leaders were
arrested under The National Security Act (NSA), the agitationists intensified
their stir. They were joined by government doctors which forced the
government to suspend some striking doctors. The suspension of the doctors
added fuel to the fire and the agitation flared up. </p>
<p>
    The students were now joined by their parents who formed a small body
in Ahmedabad and decided to work shoulder to shoulder with their wards in
their efforts to get the reservation policy scrapped. For calming down the
communal riots which had simultaneously started, the police beat up people
indiscriminately in some lower middle class residential areas in Ahmedabad.
Soon the government started talks with student leaders, opposition leaders,
and leaders of the parents’ body and accepted all demands put up by the
agitationists. It also agreed to review the policy of reservation. With the
release of student leaders and the reinstatement of the suspended doctors,
another round of violence by the agitationists started. The stir gained
momentum in other parts of the state too. Several persons had died and many
were injured and arrested in the violence. When the agitating students killed
one constable (on April 22, 1985), the constabulary revolted and stopped
work. In an unexpected move, the constables in the funeral procession of the
constable killed, attacked the journalists covering the incident. They also set
fire to a building of a Gujarati daily. Many shops, houses, banks, vehicles and
public offices were set aflame by the agitationists. The opportunist politicians
clamouring for power not only instigated the agitationists but also demanded
the resignation of the Chief Minister. Thus, what had started as an
anti-reservation agitation by students soon took the shape of Hindu-Muslim
antagonism and strife, dalit versus upper caste communal clashes and political
bickering. The stir continued for two months till the government retreated
and promised to review the reservation policy. </p>
<p>
Similarly, we may take the case of the anti—reservation agitation by the
youth in Madhya Pradesh in 1985. In this state, 23 per cent seats were reserved
for STs, 14 per cent for the SCs, 25 per cent for the backward classes, 3 per
cent for the defence personnel and ex—servicemen, 5 per cent for the freedom
fighters 4 per cent for the poor candidates and 3 per cent for the candidates
with a technical degree. Thus, since 77 per cent seats were reserved for various
groups, only 23 per cent seats remained for other persons. When students
agitated, the Chief Minister appealed to them to ‘appreciate’ the government’s
reservation policy of providing crutches to weaker sections of the society. The </p>

<p>
 students described it as a ludicrous appeal and continued their agitation. The
government did not take sufficient care to calm down the hostility simmering
among the ‘meritorious’ upper caste students. It only agreed to discuss the
issue with the students after the election. No wonder, the state remained
traumatized by violent incidents between different sections of its populace for
quite some time. </p>

<h1> Assam Agitation </h1>
<p>
The youth of Assam started agitation in 1983—84 on the issue of refugees from
East Bengal and ultimately were joined by a majority of the population in the
state. The people of Assam had always felt discriminated against and neglected
by the Centre. They had a feeling that the three big industries—tea, oil and
timber—of the state had not succeeded in forming an integral, invigorating
and sustaining part of the Assamese economy. In their arguments they cited
instances of internal colonization and the siphoning off of local resources to
stimulate economic development elsewhere. This constituted a source for
political distress. Then there were ethnic rivalries too between the Assamese
and the non-Assamese, and between the tribals and non-tribals. The intensity
of the ethnic strife could have been controlled and the process of homogeni-
zation launched and sped up, if the Centre had made the resources available
for rapid economic development. But, Assam remained neglected. It was
claimed that the total revenue generated in Assam amounted to Rs 7,000 crore
out which only Rs 500 crore (7.1%) was made available to Assam. So people
always remained economically backward. The decision of the central
government to permit refugees from the neighbouring country to enter
Assam precipitated the situation and the youth revolted and, thus, began the
AASU movement. The agitation culminated in the student community
winning the assembly elections in 1985 and forming the government. For the
first time in the history of the country, the students became political rulers. </p>
<p>
However, the state government continued to feel the pinch of being
neglected by the central government. The youth felt so agitated that ULFA
came into existence. The ULFA activists not only challenged the state
authority but sowed seeds of separation, silenced opposition at gun-point
extorted money and erected a parallel government in the state. Since the state
government failed to suppress the insurgency of the ULFA youth, the Centre
dismissed the state government from power in November 1990 and the Presi-
dent’s rule was imposed and Operation Bajrang was mounted on November
28,1990 to suppress ULFA movement and mop up the secessionists. In fresh
elections, though Congress came to power in 1991 and AGP in 1996 but
ULFA militancy till date (July 1997) has not subsided. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000236">236</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
 When people in a region suffer economically, socially, culturally and
politically because of the sudden pressure of lakhs of refugees from the neigh-
bouring country and because of the policy of neglect of the central
government, they have a right to protest against the political indecisions of the
ruling party. But one cannot tolerate blackmail of the whole nation on this
issue. It is well known that because of the AASU agitation in Assam and
because of the strike in oil companies, the nation suffered a loss of crores of
rupees. But the question remains—should the right of protest be denied to a
region which wants to develop and achieve its goals and ideals?</p>
<p>
    In a democracy, where crores of rupees are spent on elections, the society
has to bear loss on account of social protests. People of the state cannot be
branded as anti-national only because they strongly protest on some issue. The
Nagaland movement was not started by the youth but it was actively supported
by the youth. One came across many road signs in Nagaland planted by the
youth  proclaiming national unity. “India is a bouquet; Nagaland one bright
floweer”. It goes without saying that however genuine the demands/ grievances
may be, insurgency and secessionism surely cannot be tolerated. </p>

<h1> Anti -Mandal Agitation </h1>
<p>
The agitation and self-immolation cases of the youth in 1990 is something that
cannot be easily forgotten. The Janata government suddenly announced on
August 7,1990 the acceptance of the Mandal Commission’s recommendations
of reserving 27 per cent government jobs for OBC candidates. With this polit-
ically-motivated announcement, the government, in fact, showed a
matchstick to the tinder box of accumulated social unrest and people’s disen-
chantment with the existing political system. The agitation started in Delhi
and soon spread to various states in northern India. Some young students
immolated themselves as a protest and many attempted self-immolation.
Jolted by the scale and intensity of the agitation against the thoughtless accep-
tance of the Mandal Commission’s scheme of caste-based reservation, the
government came out with some proposals to defuse the crisis. States like
Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and almost all states in South India accepted these reser-
vation policies. The new Janata(S) government which came to power in
December 1990 and the Congress government which came to power in May
1991 adopted a cautious approach to this policy. The frustration of the youth
was somewhat suppressed by the new reservation policy of the Congress
government announced in September-October 1991, and again in 1993. The
anti-reservation agitation of the youth in the hilly region of Uttar Pradesh in
September 1994 ultimately culminated in the demand for separate
Uttarakhand state. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000237">237</pagenum>
<h1>
Role of Youth in Other Agitations, Page no:237
</h1>
<p>
  The militants’ agitation for Khalistan in Punjab and for an independent
Kashmir in Jammu & Kashmir and the tribals’ demand for a Jharkhand state
in Bihar have also to be explained in terms of the frustrations of the youth in
the respective states.    </p>
<p>
In Punjab, the figures compiled by the Directorate of Employment
point out that till December 1984, as many as 59,360 persons were registered
in the Employment Exchanges in Amritsar and 65,619 in Gurdaspur. Adding
figures of other cities to the registered cases, one gets the idea of the prevalent
unemployment among the youth. Large-scale unemployment has surely
helped in the growth of extremism. Even the political leaders have conf'
that the problem of extremism in Punjab has its roots in the economic
hardships faced by the youth. It was on this basis that at least two governors of
Punjab insisted, between 1985 and 1987, on focusing on the solution of the
unemployment problem of the youth in the state along with concentration on
the political solution of the problem.   </p>
<p>
In Kashmir also, the real power now rests with the young men. Many
persons arrested by the police for getting training in Pakistan are young
persons in the 18-25 age group. A lot of Kashmiris asking for independence
are angry young men, who have sworn vengeance. And, there is no method in
their madness. </p>
<p>
The movement of the tribals of Chotanagpur and the Santhal Pargana
areas of Bihar, popularly called the Jharkhand movement, for a separate state
entered a new phase with All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) organizing a
successful 72- hour economic blockade in February 1991, by disrupting the
movement of minerals from south Bihar. The Centre appeared to be prepared
to concede an autonomous council on the Gorkhaland pattern but the
Jharkhandis were insisting on nothing less than a separate state for preserving
their cultural heritage and distinct identity. The tribal youth believed that the
Hinduization (because of settlement of outside low caste Hindus in the
interior areas) and the spread of Christianity have had a deleterious effect on
their centuries-old social cohesiveness. They thought that the emerging
cross-cultural milieu (because of the urbanization and industrialization
processes) had only exposed them to assimilation.   </p>
<p>
The Chhotanagpur tribals have been resisting the iniquitous system of
dams, factories and exploitation of mineral wealth. The State Reorganization
Commission had dismissed the demand for Jharkhand as impractical and
ill-founded but the Adivasi Mahasabha, the precursor of the Jharkhand party.
used this slogan of separate state and captured all the tribal majority seats in
the area in 1991 elections. Since then, the movement gained momentum,   </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000238">238</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
though the lack of proper leadership and a united organization was the main
drawback of the movement. The AJSU formed a United Jharkhand Party
UJP) on the AASU pattern in Assam. The tribal youth, then, seemed to be
determined to prove their strength and could succeed in getting their demand
for a separate Jharkhand state in 2000 fulfilled. </p>
<p>
    Taking all these youth agitations into consideration, it appears that most
Indian youths had become so frustrated and pessimistic that they started
believing that it would not be possible to improve the lot of the people in the
country even after making a large number of policies and programmes by the
government. According to an all-India survey done of a sample of 2,100 youth
in 38 towns across the country by the Operation Research Group (ORG), a
multidisciplinary research organization, in April 1988, on youth perceptions,
the youth voiced their concern at the dwindling job opportunities (The
Hindustan Times, 15 May,1988). More than 62 per cent respondents said that
the employment situation had worsened. About 52.2 per cent were convinced
that India was not set on the right track for progress and development.
Another 36.7 per cent felt that there would be no improvement in the lot of
Indians even ten years hence. About 26 per cent thought that the conditions
would, in fact, worsen. The survey also revealed a mixed response to the
government’s new education policy. Less than 37 per cent felt the policy was
good or necessary for the country. In contrast, more than 27 per cent asserted
that the policy would be of little consequence. </p>
<p>
   But, of late, two agitations—Anna Hazare’s anti—corruption movement
(2011) and the one for demanding Justice for the victim of Delhi gangrape case
(2012)—have not only offered a ray of hope but also set a new trend of
cause-driven youth agitations in India. Till now, we have been witnessing two
types of youths in India—one who is pro-government and the other who is
anti- government. But, during these agitations, we have seen the birth of a
'new' youth who did not believe in “sab chalta hai” dictum and wants
immediate change in the system. These are the people who are now agitating
across the country and are also achieving satisfactory results. The main
reasons for this are social media, system failure and the paralysis of our
political system. </p>
<p>
Anna’s movement against corruption inspired youth in a big way. In
contrast to the massive hired crowds generally seen at political rallies, those
who came to meetings were mostly the young people for whom Anna was a
combination of both Gandhi and a rockstar. These demonstrations were also
different in a way that they were mostly attended by youth of the country,
just expressing their concern about corruption. Thus, it was the active partici-
pation of youth that made Anna’s movement a great success. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000239">239</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
 Similarly, the gang-rape of a 23-year-old paramedical intern (who later
died after 13 days in a Singapore hospital) by six persons in a moving bus in
the capital city in the night of 16 December 2012 also disenchanted the
country’s youths in a big way. In the protests following the incident in
different parts of the country, especially Delhi, the participation of youth was
tremendous. Even the police action against the protesters could not dampen
their spirits, demanding justice for the girl. In Delhi, the protests were mainly
held at India Gate where thousands of young demonstrators were
lathi-charged, shot with water cannons and tear gas shells, and arrested by
police. In similar protests held in other parts of the country mostly young
people took part. The issue was highly sensitized both in print media and
social media. Lakhs of youths also signed an online petition protesting the
incident. And, it was the result of these widespread protests that governments
at the centre and in various states announced several steps to ensure the safety
of women. The important thing that was noticed during both the movements
was their being non-violent in character.  </p>

<h1> Types of Youth Agitations </h1>
<p>
Youth agitations are not always violent or coercive. Many a time they use
persuasive technique too. We may classify youth agitations into the following
groups: </p>
<p>
1. Persuasive agitations: In these agitations, the youth attempt to change the
attitude of the powers that be by discussing their problems with them
across a table and making them accept their viewpoint. These agitations
range from the relatively trivial issues (postponing the examinations,
extending the admission date) to significant issues (increasing the number
of seats) to realty serious issues (giving representation in academic bodies,
associating students with decision-making processes). Protest demonstra-
tions, shouting of slogans, persuading the power holders to meet the
representatives of the students/ youth to try and understand their views
and demands are some of the methods used in this kind of agitation. the
anger and injustice expressed through this method not only serves to
arouse and mobilize popular support of passive students/ youth but also
helps drain off discontent into ‘harmless’ emotional outlets. </p>
<p>
2. Resistance agitations: The main object in these types of agitation is to keep
the power holders in their place. Many changes intended to be introduced
by the authorities appear to be disturbing to students/ youth who feel that
either their precious years are being wasted or that legitimate opportu-
nities are being denied to them or their careers are going to be adversely
affected. For example, the decision of one university to show reduced  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000240">240</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
marks on the marks sheet, if on revaluation the candidate’s marks are
reduced, was resisted by the students through agitations which ultimately
forced the academic council of the university to decide that marks would
not be reduced on revaluation. Or say, a university decides to introduce
semester scheme or internal assessment scheme or scheme of making 75
per cent attendance compulsory. Students may resist these measures.
Resistance agitations express the dismay and concern of the students at the
direction in which the university is moving. </p>
<p>
3. Revolutionary agitations: These agitations aim at bringing sudden
sweeping changes in the educational or the social systems. For example,
forcing the authorities to decide that no student will be declared as failed
but will be promoted to higher class and given the opportunity to appear
in the failed paper/ subject till he clears it. Revolutionary leaders see basic
change as possible only after the existing system is overthrown and a
new system is introduced in one go. Instances of revolutionary agitations
can be illustrated by the youth agitation in China in 1987, the AASU
agitation in Assam. in 1984, Uttarakhand agitation in Uttar Pradesh in
1994 and Bodo agitation in Assam during 1989-96. The last agitation is
characterized by a growing discontent, increasing disorder, an attempt to
overthrow the government, militant activities of the extremists, a reign
of terror, and an attempt to smuggle weapons from abroad. </p>

<h1> Youth Receptive to Agitations </h1>
<p>
Five types of youth who take to agitational activities have been identified: </p>
<p>
1. Socially isolated: Youth who feel alienated and cut off from the larger
   society.

2. Personally maladjusted: Youth who have failed to find a satisfying life
role, for example, those who have not developed an adequate interest in
studies, are unemployed or underemployed or unsuccessful. They join
agitations because of an emotional need to fill the void in their lives.

3.Unattached to family: Youth who lack intimate ties with their families
are encouraged to participate in agitations. Young persons with warm
and satisfying family ties have no emotional need to join agitations.

4.Marginals: Youth who are not fully accepted and integrated with their
caste/ religious/ linguistic group feel uneasy, insecure and resentful. They
find it difficult to resolve the discrepancy in self-image and public image
which necessitates them to join agitations to get some recognition.

5.Mobile/migrants: Migrants have little chance of getting integrated into
the larger community. Joining agitations acts as refuge for them. </p>

<p>
  Shah (1968: 57—63) conducted a study of university students in Gujarat.
He classified students on the basis of their social status into four groups to
point out the type of students who are more undisciplined or in whom we
find more unrest:   </p>
<p>
1. High status, high ability: These are students who are eligible for admission
in any course, who have full confidence in self, who can adjust to all
situations and who take keen interest in studies. They remain confident
of achieving goals because of their abilities, work hard, do not create any
problems and remain away from strikes and demonstrations.

2. Low status, high ability: These are students who have high ability and are
mature, who try to differentiate between right and wrong, work hard,
aim at good percentages and grades, remain away from activities which
harm them since they have to depend on themselves for getting jobs and
promotions and do not participate in strikes and demonstrations.
However, there are some youth in this group who in spite of their
abilities fail to get recognition as they belong to poor class or to the SCs
STs or OBCs. These students participate in agitations because of their
frustrations.

3. High status, low ability: These are students who can get admission in the
desired course because of their influence. However, they cannot
compete with good students of high academic standards because of their
low ability and, therefore, develop new non—academic values and
behaviour patterns. For example, they find nothing wrong in using
unfair means, remaining absent from class, creating noise in the
classroom, spending more time in college canteens, using pressure tactics
on teachers, attempting to bribe examiners and participating in agita-
tions and instigating others to indulge in such activities.

4. Low status, low ability: These are students some of whom take interest in
agitations but some keep themselves aloof from such activities. It
depends on their peer group as well as their personal aspirations. Thus,
more unrest is found among students of second and third categories.  </p>
<p>
It may, therefore, be concluded that important things in students’ unrest
and agitations are: students’ family background, students’ abilities, availability
of opportunities to earn livelihood, and educational system, that is, teachers’
abilities, teaching techniques, the content of courses (whether these courses
are job-oriented or otherwise) and administrators’ interest in solving students’
legitimate grievances. Lipset gives importance to one more factor, namely, the
number of years a student has spent in college/ university. The more the years
spent, the more is participation in agitations.  </p>

<h1>
Causes of Youth Unrest and Agitations, Page no:242
</h1>
<p>
The UGC Committee of 1960 pointed out the following reasons for student
agitations: (1) economic causes, like demands for reducing fees, increasing
scholarship, (2) demands for changes in existing norms pertaining to admis-
sions, examinations, and teaching, (3) poor functioning of
colleges/ universities with non-purchase of chemicals and instruments for
laboratories, or books and journals for libraries, (4) conflicting relations
between students and teachers (teachers being accused of frequently cutting
classes and remaining non-committed to teaching, (5) inadequate facilities in
the campus, like inadequate hostels, poor food in hostels, lack of canteens and
poor drinking water facilities, and (6) leaders being instigated by politicians. </p>
<p>
  Dibona (n. d.) studied agitations in one university in Uttar Pradesh and
gave three causes of student agitations: (1) economic causes, which included a
sense of insecurity for the future and gap between economic needs of the
country and the educational system, that is, education being viewed as
non-job—oriented; (2) socio psychological causes, which included defective educa-
tional system, gap between aspiration and achievement (getting 80% marks
and yet failing to get admission in college of one’s interest), social distance
between teacher and students, non-committed teachers, policy of status quo,
corruption and inefficiency, and large number of students in the class or
inadequate number of sections in the department/ college; and (3) political
causes, which included, political interference, and instigation by political
leaders. All these factors indicate that the main cause of student unrest and
agitations in particular and youth agitations in general lies in social system
rather than the personality of the youth. </p>

<h1> Theories on the Causes of Youth Agitations </h1>
<p>
Two kinds of theories may be suggested to explain youth agitations: psycho-
logical and sociological. The former emphasize on the personality of the
individual and the latter on the society. The two important psychological
theories are: (a) discontent theory, and (b) personal maladjustment theory,
while the two important sociological theories are: (a) relative deprivation
theory, and (b) resource mobilization theory. </p>
<p>
The Discontent Theory holds that agitations are rooted in discontent.
Youth who have either no high aspirations or are contented and comfortable
with what they have or what they are likely to have will have no interest in
agitations. But, the angry youth who feel victimized by outrageous injustice,
or those who feel even mildly annoyed with existing structures and opportu-
nities will collectively act to pressurize the power holders to bring some
change (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>
 It is probably true that without discontent amongst the youth, there will
be no youth agitations. But ‘discontent’ is not an adequate explanation. There
is no convincing evidence of any close association between the level of
grievance and discontent amongst the youth and its level of agitational
activity. Young people may endure great discontent and refrain from
agitating. Since independence, youth in India have endured corruption,
inequality, exploitation, political manipulations, police brutality, bureaucratic
callousness, religious fanaticism without serious social protest. In fact, all
modern societies always have enough discontent to fuel many agitations and
movements (Turner and Killian, 1972: 271). Discontent may be a necessary
condition but not a sufficient condition for youth agitations. </p>
<p>
The Personal Maladjustment Theory sees agitations as a refuge from
personal failure. Agitators find their supporters among the unhappy,
frustrated young persons whose lives lack meaning and fulfilment. Huffer
(1951) has also said that the kinds of people who are drawn to agitations and
social movements are the bored, the misfits, the creative who cannot create,
the guilty, the downwardly mobile, and those who are seriously dissatisfied
with their lives. They add meaning and purpose to their empty lives through
agitational activity. Horton and Hunt (1984: 500) have also said that it is
plausible that young people who feel unfulfilled and maladjusted should be
more attracted to agitational activities than those who are complacent and feel
adjusted. Those who find their personal lives absorbing and fulfilling are less
in need of something to give them feelings of personal worth and </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000244">244</pagenum>

Page no:244
</h1>
<p>
accomplishment, for they already have these. The agitation supporters are
mainly the frustrated misfits of society.  </p>
<p>
Even though, the misfit theory is plausible, it is not well substantiated. It
is difficult to measure a person’s sense of nonfulfilment. All student agitations
in universities and colleges cannot be explained simply in terms of personal
failures of student leaders and activists. Youth agitations in different parts of
the country on the occasion of implementing Mandal Commission’s report in
August 1990 cannot be described in terms of young persons’ personal malad-
justment. </p>
<p>
   The Relative Deprivation Remy was propounded by Samuel Stouffer in
1949 (The American Soldier, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1950)It
can be properly explained by distinguishing between discontent, deprivation
and relative deprivation. A group feels ‘deprived’ if it is prevented from using
or enjoying a goal/ object it regards as attractive or desirable, but it feels
‘discontented’ when it had been anticipating the pleasure to be achieved with
object and then cannot fulfil this expectation. Relative deprivation is the
perception that one (as a group) is less well-off than others to whom it (the
group) compared itself (Myres, 1988: 402 and 408). Deprivation or disad-
vantage is measured not by objective standards but by comparison with the
relatively superior advantages of others whom one desires to emulate. It, thus,
talks of the gap between expectations and realizations. The group which
wants little and has little feels less deprived than the one which has much but
expects still more.  </p>
<p>
Relative deprivation is increasing throughout most of the underde-
veloped world. Youth in India also feel that lack of opportunities,
unemployment, reservations on caste basis, limitations on higher education,
particularly technical and professional education, adversely affect intellectual
ability, and as such are avoidable. They long for better jobs, economic
security, promotional opportunities, social mobility and all those things that
many others enjoy. They hunger for these treasures but have little real under-
standing of what it takes to produce them. Even where the youth are
beginning to get some of the things they covet or eagerly desire, these satisfac-
tions come with an unbearable slowness. A weakening of traditional controls
accompanies this enormous inflation of desires. The existing social structures
and the power elite have little hope of keeping up with the youth’s expecta-
tions. Thus, when young people become most miserable, agitations seem
most likely to occur. Davies (1962) and Geschwender (1968) have also
maintained that the outbreak of agitations most often happens after a
downturn has interrupted a period of improvement, creating an intolerable
gap between rising expectations and falling realizations. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000245">245</pagenum>
<h1>
page no:245
</h1>
<p>
 The Relative Deprivation Theory is plausible but not substantiated.
Feelings of deprivation in youth are easy to infer but difficult to measure and
still more difficult to plot over a period of time. It may, therefore, be said that
relative deprivation of youth, even when unmistakably severe, is only one of
many factors in youth agitations. </p>
<p>
     The Resource Mobilization Theory stresses techniques rather than causes
of (youth) agitations. It attributes importance to the effective use of resources
in promoting agitations, since a successful agitation demands effective organi-
zation and sage tactic. Resource mobilization theorists see (youth) leadership,
organization and tactics as major determinants of the success or failure of
(youth) agitations (Oberschell, 1973; Wilson, 1973; Galnson, 1975; McCarthy,
1979; Walsh, 1981). These scholars concede that without grievances and
discontent, there would be few agitations but add that mobilization is needed
to direct this discontent into an effective agitation. </p>
<p>
    The resources to be mobilized include: support of the masses, help of
rules / laws that can provide leverage, cooperation of organizations and
officials that can be helpful, and assistance of target groups whom these
benefits might attract These are weighed against costs of agitational activity,
opposition to be anticipated, difficulties to be overcome, and tactics of
operation to be developed. </p>
<p>
As an example, the AASU agitation in Assam in 1984-85 occurred when
the movement for giving more rights to states by the Centre was gaining
momentum and when people in different parts of the country challenged the
wisdom of the central political leaders giving refuge to Muslims from
Bangladesh. Similarly, the anti-reservation agitation by students in Delhi,
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in August 1990
started because of reserving 27 per cent seats in central government jobs for
OBCs occurred when a large number of people and various political parties
criticized the government for this action and the youth got a sympathetic
backing from the masses. Similarly, the anti-reservation agitation of students
in hill region in Uttar Pradesh in September 1994 ultimately turned into
agitation for a separate Uttarakhand state only when the students got the full
support of government employees and even masses, including illiterate men
and women. The discontent was wide spread and the mobilization of
resources was enough. </p>
<p>
  The Resource Mobilization Theory does not explain all kinds of youth
agitations. If we classify agitations as persuasive, revolutionary and resistance
agitations, the resource mobilization theory does not fit into resistance agita-
tions. These agitations succeed without organization and tactics. Further,
evidence for resource mobilization theory is largely descriptive and is
challenged by scholars like Goldstone (1980). </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000246">246</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:246
</h1>
<p>
It may be concluded that it is likely that discontent, personal malad-
justment, relative deprivation, and resource mobilization are all involved in
youth agitations but in undetermined proportions. Each theory is, thus,
plausible but each lacks clear proof and evidence. So many variables are
involved in youth agitations that possibly no one theory will ever be conclu-
sively established. </p>

<h1> Youth Leadership </h1>
<p>
The leadership profoundly affects the intensity and direction of youth agita-
tions and movements. The important functions of a youth leader are:(1)
establishing a responsive, trusting, attentive relationship with the members of
his group. He senses their feelings and speaks their language; (2) building an
emotional rapport with the members by an impassioned reminder of their
problems and-grievances. He stimulates them to direct activity from one
objective to another; and (3) suggesting action to achieve goal(s). It could take
the form of demonstrations, road blocks, gheraos, strikes or even boycott of
classes. These functions could be successfully performed only by leaders who
have certain qualities and background. Sarkar’s (1960) study of the
office-holders and the king-makers of student unions in different universities
has revealed that union leaders are mainly those. (1) who have money, (2) who
do not have high academic aspirations, (3) who have some political backing,
(4) who are good orators, and (5) who are manipulators.  </p>
<p>
Robert Shaw’s study of Osmania University student leaders in the early
1960s pointed out (Altbatch, 1968: 90—95) that: (1) their average family income
was higher than the average income of Indian family; (2) two-thirds belonged
to upper-middle class and one-third to the upper class; (3) a very large number
belong to upper castes and families of high social status; (4) one-third (34%)
had spent less than three years in the university, one-third (33%) three to six
years, one-tenth (11%) six to nine years, and one-fifth (22%) more than nine
years; (5) three-fifth (57%) were below average in studies, one-fourth (23%)
average and only one-fifth (20%) brilliant; (6) two-thirds had no political
aspirations but one-third had some aspirations to enter politics and contest
assembly elections; (7) a little less than three-fifths (56%) believed in ideology
of some political party, one-tenth (11%) had an independent ideology and
one-third (33%) did not believe in any political ideology; and (8) in one-fifth
cases (20%), their family members or kin were active in politics but in
four-fifth cases (80%), no member of their family had any political leanings. It
may thus be stated that those who economically handicapped and socially not
warped and who are academically average and politically ambitious generally
make student/ youth leaders.  </p>

<h1>
Role of Police in Youth Agitations, Page no:247
</h1>
<p>
The role of the police in youth agitations starts when the youth indulge in
violence, destroy public property, gherao administrative officer(s), declare
bandh and force shopkeepers to close market, sit on hunger strike, or block
the road and stop movement of the traffic. </p>
<p>
   The traditional methods which are usually adopted by the police in such
situations are: arresting the trouble-makers ordering onlookers to move on,
using tear-gas and lathi-charge, bringing enough police and creating fear,
isolating riot-area by throwing a police cordon around it, and diminishing the
crowd by directing persons to disperse, thus, depriving the core (of agitated
group) of its mass support. Generally, the police succeeds in containing youth
agitation by these methods. If it fails, it is only because of its own indecision
and hesitation, or because it covertly sympathizes with rioters, or because it is
not able to arrest the real trouble-makers because of the political or bureau-
cratic interference. </p>
<p>
    What the policemen need is: (i) to secure a preliminary tuning with
agitators. On their arrival at the agitation spot, they need not immediately
threaten the agitators or start beating them. On the contrary, they should give
a feeling that they are there only to maintain law and order and not to punish
the agitators; (ii) to establish a rapport with the agitationists either by talking
to the leader or the activist members; (iii) to break 'one-to-all' relationship,
that is, relationship between the leader and the followers; and (iv) neither to
use logic nor appeal to the intellect of the agitators but to appeal to their
emotions. </p>
<p>
    All this can be made possible by either (a) manipulating the situation, or
(b) manipulating the individuals (agitators). The manipulation could be
positive or negative as shown in the following figure: </p>
<p>
                        Figure 2
    Handling agitational situation (manipulation) by police

 Type of      Manipulation of       Manipulation of individuals’

 Positive       Inducement                     Persuasion
 Negative       Coercion               Activation of commitment </p>

<p>
    The police can adopt measures like this only if it believes in neutrality,
loyalty, moral duty, and accountability. The decision of the decision-maker
(police) in a decision-making situation depends upon: (i) degree of
involvement of self in solving the problem and (ii) perception of uncertainty </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000248">248</pagenum>
<h1>
page no:248
</h1>
<p>
to handle the situation (agitation) by following precedents (used earlier by
other officers) or by using new approaches. Low degree of involvement of self
(LIS) and high perception of uncertainty (HPU) lead to poor decision (PD) on
the part of the decision-maker (police), while high involvement of self (HIS)
and low perception of uncertainty (LPU) lead to correct or adequate decision
(AD).
PD = LIS + HPU
AD = HIS + LPU </p>
<p>
That police officer will have a low involvement of self in solving
problem or containing an agitation who takes decisions not on the basis of his
moral convictions or values but by external pressures, who depends on others
for evaluating his decision, who feels satisfied with his own decision only if
others feel satisfied, who considers agitation as a routine task and not as a
challenge, who has low personal stake in containing the agitation or solving
the problem, and who avoids certain decisions for fear of their consequences. </p>
<p>
The perception of uncertainty by the decision-maker (police officer) in
the decision-making situation may also be because of his lack of past
experience, that is, he may not have met with such a situation earlier, or he
may have been unable to get the right amount of information, that is, there
may be too little information about the decision-making situation, or the
situation itself may be poorly defined in terms of objectives, time and
direction, or the police officer may lack the ability to evaluate situation as well
as the decision choices. </p>
<p>
Our ruling political elite have never given proper attention to
revamping the police system. What is needed more today is more profession-
alism in this field (Sharma, 1977) which is characterized by decentralization (a.
separation of administration of law-violence from administration of
preserving order, as these two kinds of jobs are not similar), autonomy
(preventing the undesirable intervention of political leaders and bureaucratic
executives), specialization (having separate police for dealing with agitations,
juvenile delinquency, communal riots, and  so forth), modernization
equipping police with modern technology as well as developing modem
ideology (correctional and protective rather than bossist), and accountability
(to the public, to ideology, to law rather than the politicians in power). </p>

<h1> Controlling Youth Agitations </h1>
<p>
We have examined the prominent causes as well as scrutinized the important
theories of youth agitations. Obviously, the forces producing unrest and agita-
tions cannot be eliminated. How, then, might youth agitations be minimized?
Do theory and research suggest ways to control agitations?  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000249">249</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:249
</h1>
<p>
1. An average young man is individualistic, imaginative and competitive.
He only wants guidance so that his enthusiasm and zest could be properly
channelized. Youngsters should be taught to vent their anger. If a person bottles
up his rage, he has to find an outlet which may give him an opportunity to let
off the stored steam. In psychiatric terminology, this means that one’s accumu-
lated aggressive energy, be it from frustrations or from the building up of
instinctual impulses, needs a release. Parents have also to encourage their
children’s release of emotional tension in various kinds of activities. </p>
<p>
  Some scholars have, however, rejected this catharsis (outlet to emotion)
hypothesis. Social psychologists like Geen and Quanty (1977) maintain that
the catharsis view of aggression and agitation has not been confirmed. Robert
Arms and his associates report that Canadian and American spectators of
football, wrestling, and hockey exhibit more hostility after viewing the event
than before (Arms et al., 1979, Goldstein and Arms, 1971, Russel, 1981, 1983).
In more direct laboratory tests of the catharsis hypothesis, Jack Hokanson
and his colleagues (1961,1962,1966) found that when Florida State University
students were allowed to counterattack someone who had provoked them,
their arousal (as measured by their blood pressures) returned to normal
quickly. This calming effect of retaliation seems to occur only in very specific
circumstances—when the target is one’s actual tormentor, not a substitute,
and when the retaliation is justifiable and the target non-intimidating so that
one does not afterwards feel guilty or anxious. On the other hand, in other
experiments, aggression has actually led to heightened aggression. It is,
therefore, necessary to help the youth to bottle up their anger and aggressive
urges. Instead of using agitations to express one’s grievances, it is more
essential to use non-agitational ways to express one’s feelings and to inform
others (particularly decision-makers and power-monopolizers) how their
behaviour and their decisions adversely affect others. Perhaps stating that
"when you take such decision, we feel irritated and angry and feel like taking
to agitative methods” might communicate the youngsters’ feelings in a way
taht leads the power elite to make amends rather than further escalate the
aggression. Myres (1988: 437) has also said that one can be assertive without
being aggressive </p>
<p>
2. The adult world has to accept the fact that youth problems cannot be
solved for them but with them. Therefore, co-operation of students/ youths
need to be sought by parents, teachers and administrators. Youth/ students,
parents , teachers, educational administrators, politicians and political parties
should cooperate in understanding problems/ grievances of the youth and
giving them logical guidelines. </p>
<p>
3. Efforts should be taken to remove minor irritants in
students’/youths’ day-to-day contacts with teachers and educational  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000250">250</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:250
</h1>
<p>
administrators. Each educational institution must have an efficient machinery
to identify and settle student grievances. Such arrangements must not only
start tackling problems after they flare up but must continuously strive to
prevent incidents which lead to complications. Such bodies (students/ teachers
etc.) should be continuously in session. The effective measures for the
redressal of the grievances could be: (a) accessibility of senior functionaries, (b)
ensuring action on grievance in shortest possible time or with a definite
time—frame, (c) establishing monitoring system and getting regular reports
from teachers and subordinate administrative staff, and (d) sudden check-up
by vice-chancellor or dean or person-in-power. </p>
<p>
4.All political parties have to agree on a common code of conduct
regarding students’ participation in politics. It will prepare them for shoul-
dering responsibilities in future for national development. There is no point
in exhorting students to keep away from politics and yet expect them to get
enthusiastically involved in the process of building up our society. </p>
<p>
5. The question of the extent and pattern of student participation in the
process of educational administration will have to be decided at the earliest. </p>
<p>
6. Definite rules should be framed regarding police intervention in
educational institutions. We can think of instituting a special University
Police Force. We can also have specially trained police personnel for dealing
with students in particular and youth in general.  </p>
<p>
It is high time that the vast youth power, which hitherto has been
neglected and ignored, was harnessed for development, removal of social
injustice and achieving national collective goals. The need for creating a
climate of hope, confidence and trust rather than coercion and confrontation
has to be realized and this initiative has to be taken for mobilizing the young. </p>

Child Abuse and Child Labour, Page no:252

<p>
Despite hectic planning, welfare programmes, legislation and administrative
action in the past six decades, a large majority of the Indian children continue
to remain in distress and turmoil. In most families, the parents neglect them,
caretakers batter them and in workplaces employers sexually abuse them.
Though this problem of emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children in
India is increasing, it has failed to capture the attention of sociologists and
psychiatrists in our country. The public and the government also are yet to
recognize it as a serious problem. Public indignation and professional concern
is yet to be translated into positive and realistic action. </p>

                             <h1> Child Abuse </h1>
<p>
Concept and Types
Some studies limit the term ‘child abuse’ to “children who have received
serious physical injury caused wilfully rather than by accident” (Garden and
Gray, 1982: 5). This definition has not been accepted by the social scientists
because of the ambiguities in the word ‘serious’ and diversities in ‘physical
injury. Kempe and Kempe (1978) have defined child abuse as “a condition
having to do with those who have been deliberately injured by physical
assault". This definition is limited in scope as it restricts abuse only to those
acts of physical violence which produce a diagnostic injury. Thus, acts of
neglect and maltreatment of children which do not produce an injury but are
equally harmful cannot be included in this definition. No definition of child
abuse can be considered valid unless it includes non-physical acts like mental
injury and neglect and ill-treatment of a child. Burgess (1979: 143) has given a </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000253">253</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
wider definition of child abuse. According to him, child abuse refers to “any
child who receives non-accidental physical and psychological injury as a result
of acts and omissions on the part of his parents or guardians or employers...”.
Verbal abuse, threats of physical violence, and excessive physical punishment
which do not require medical attention are also included in the definition of
child abuse. </p>
<p>
     Child abuse is usually classified into three major types: physical, sexual
and emotional. Each has recognizable characteristics. The indicators of
physical abuse in the child described by Sloan (1983: 2—3) are: bruises, burns,
fractures, lacerations and abrasions, abdominal injuries, and human-bite
marks. The behavioural indicators of physical abuse are: the abused child is
wary of contact with adults, becomes apprehensive when other children cry,
shows aggressiveness in behaviour, seems frightened of the parents/ caretakers,
and is afraid to go home or cries when it is time to go home. </p>
<p>
    Child sexual abuse has been defined as “the involvement of dependent and
immature children in sexual activities they do not fully comprehend, to which
they are unable to give informed consent” (Kempe and Kempe, 1978: 127). The
Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 defines child sexual abuse as “interaction between a
child (under the age of 18 for girls and 16 for boys) and an adult (who is signifi-
cantly older than the victim and is in a position of power or control over the
child, or may even be an acquaintance or an unknown person) in which the
child is being used for the sexual stimulation of the perpetrator or another
person”. Sexual abuse is not often identified through physical indicators alone.
Frequently, a child confides in a trusted person (mother, friend, neighbour, kin
or sister) that she/ he has been sexually assaulted. There are, however, some
physical signs of sexual abuse. These are difficulty in walking or sitting, torn,
stained or bloody underclothes, complaints of pain or itching, bruises or
bleeding, venereal disease, and pregnancy (in early adolescence) (Sloan, 1983:6).
There are some behavioural indicators too of sexual abuse. The sexually abused
child may appear withdrawn or retarded, may have poor peer relationships,
may be unwilling to participate in activities, may indulge in delinquent
Recently, a news of horrific child sexual abuse that came from New Zealand has
shocked everybody, particularly those working in the field. An 11-year-old boy
has become a father after conceiving a child with the 36-year-old mother of a
school friend. The woman coerced the boy, from Auckland, into repeated
sexual encounters over a period of time before becoming pregnant. She gave the
boy beer to drink and then took part in sexual encounter (Times of India, 20
June 2013) </p>
 <p>
Emotional abuse is the neglect or maltreatment of children. ‘Neglect’ is
difficult to define exactly since it may involve a disregard of the physical, </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000254">254</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:254
</h1>
<p>
emotional, moral or social needs of the children. Physical neglect has been
defined as “failure to provide the essentials for normal life, such as food,
clothing, shelter, care and supervision, and protection from assault".
Emotional neglect includes both the lack of expressed love and affection and
the deliberate withholding of contact and approval. Moral neglect includes
exposure to situations (alcoholism, obscenity, illicit sex relations) that present
a pattern of moral conduct at variance with the norms of society. Social
neglect includes failure to train or discipline a child (Kratcoski, 1979:120).
Thus, emotional neglect or 'maltreatment' may be described as “negligent
treatment of a child under the specific age prescribed for the children by the
given society (18 for girls and 16 for boys in India) by a person who is respon-
sible for the child’s upbringing, care and welfare under circumstances which
indicate that the child’s health or welfare is harmed or threatened there by".
This definition characterizes ‘omission’ and not ‘commission’ as abuse
Emotional maltreatment of the child includes blaming, belittling, rejecting,
constantly treating siblings unequally, and persistent lack of concern by the
parent/ caretaker for the child’s welfare. Emotional maltreatment is rarely
manifest in physical signs. A few physical indicators of emo
maltreatment are speech disorders, lag in physical development and
failure-to-thrive syndrome (Sloan, 1983: 7). The behavioural characteristics of
emotional maltreatment are: habit disorders (biting, thumb sucking), conduct
disorders (destructiveness, cruelty, stealing), neurotic traits (sleep disorders,
inhibition of play), psycho-neurotic reaction (hysteria, phobias, obsession),
behaviour extremes (appearing overly complainant, extremely passive or
aggressive, very demanding or undemanding), lag in emotional and intel-
lectual development, and attempted suicide (Denver, 1961. 6-7).  </p>
<p>
   Besides above mentioned three types of child abuse, we can also refer to
social abuse of children, like kidnapping children and forcing them to beg in
streets. We read about such cases in newspapers. In January 1997, for example,
76 children, most of them girls, between the age group of 5 and 12 years were
deported from Saudi Arabia to India. These children languished for some time
in remand homes in Mumbai. Since they could not be kept indefinitely in
these homes as they had not committed any crime, they were sent to their
parents or were let off on the streets of Mumbai to beg as they were begging in
Saudi Arabia. Some of them might even resort to crime in order to sustain
themselves. What is important in a case like this is how did they reach Saudi
Arabia from India? If they were allowed out legally, who had applied for their
passage? Were they sold by their parents? The children had certain tattoo
marks on their arms and these could be some sort of ‘branding’. Could flesh
running syndicates or begging syndicate be involved in this grim trade of </p>

<p>
exporting children abroad? Were they used for sexual gratification? Were they
used for gold smuggling or Hawala operations? This type of child abuse calls
for deep scrutiny. </p>
<p>
     And, in recent times, online abuse has become so commonplace that half
of children in Britain accept that it is a part of their daily life, according to a
poll carried out by the Anti-Bullying Alliance. Not only this, four in ten
parents are unable to help (Times of India, 22 October 2013). In India, more or
less the same situation exists. </p>

<h1> Incidence of Child Abuse </h1>
<p>
In the absence of public and government interest in the problem of child
abuse, no formal statistics have been compiled in India to indicate the
incidence of abuse. However, studies are conducted by various organiza-
tions / agencies from time to time. For example, at the behest of the UNICEF
and Save the Children, the Ministry of Women and Child Development,
Government of India has recently conducted a study to develop a dependable
and comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of child abuse, and
also formulation of policies and programmes meant to effectively curb and
control the problem of child abuse in the country. The findings of the study
reveal  that children are abused not only physically but also sexually and
emotionally. Across different forms of abuse, and across different evidence
groups, the younger children (5-12 years of age) have reported higher levels of
abuse. Boys, as compared to girls, are equally at risk of abuse. Persons in trust
and authority are major abusers. And, 70 per cent of abused children never
reported the matter to anyone. </p>
<p>
So far as the physical abuse of the children is concerned, it was found
that: </p>
<p>
1. Two out of every three children are physically abused.

2. Out of 69 per cent children physically abused in 13 sample states, 54.68
per cent were boys.

3. Over 50 per cent children in all the 13 sample states were being subjected
to one or the other form of physical abuse.

4. Out of those children physically abused in family situations, 88.6 per
cent were physically abused by parents.

5. 65 per cent of school going children reported facing corporal
punishment, i.e., two out of three children were victims of corporal
punishment.

6. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Delhi have almost
consistently reported higher rates of abuse in all forms as compared to
other states. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000256">256</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:256
</h1>
<p>
7. Most children did not report the matter to anyone.
8. 50.2 per cent children worked seven days a week.
Regarding the sexual abuse of the children, the study revealed that:
(i) 53.22 per cent children reported having faced one or more forms
of sexual abuse.
(ii) Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Delhi reported the  highest
percentage of sexual abuse among both boys and girls.
(iii) 21.90 per cent child respondents reported facing severe forms of
sexual abuse and 50.76 per cent other forms of sexual abuse.
(iv) Out of the child respondents, 5.69 per cent reported being
sexually assaulted.
(v) Children in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi reported
the highest incidence of sexual assault.
(vi) Children on street, children at work and children in institu-
tional care reported the highest incidence of sexual assault.
(vii) 50 per cent abuses are persons known to the child or in a
position of trust and responsibility.
(viii) Most children did not report the matter to anyone.
With regard to the emotional abuse of the children, the study found that:
(a) Every second child reported facing emotional abuse.
(b) Equal percentage of both girls and boys reported facing emotional abuse.
(c) In 83 per cent of the cases parents were the abusers.
(d) 48. 4 per cent of girls wished they were boys. </p>
<p>
The gravity of the situation, thus, demands that the issue of child abuse
be placed on the national agenda. The government on its part has taken
measures such as the enabling legislation to establish the National and State
Commissions for Protection of Rights of the Child, the Integrated Child
Protection Scheme, Offences against Children Bill etc. These are a few
important steps to ensure protection of children of the country. But clearly,
this will not be enough, and the government, civil society and communities
need to complement each other and work towards creating a protective
environment for children. </p>
<h1> Theoretical Explanations of Child Abuse </h1>
<p>
A number of explanations have been given by scholars to explain the motiva-
tional factors in child abuse. Of these, the important ones are: (i) psychiatric
explanation; (ii) socio—cultural explanation which includes (a) social situational
explanation, (b) social habitability explanation, and (c ) social control expla-
nation; (iii) resource explanation, (iv) social interactional explanation; and (v)
social learning explanation. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000257">257</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:257
</h1>
<p>
The psychiatric explanation was propounded by scholars like Kempe
(1972), Steele and Pollock (1968), Gelles (1973) and Park and Collmer (1975). It
links with child abuse factors such as mental illness and personality defects or
intra-individual abnormalities. It also links abusive parents’ own childhood
experiences to the individuals’ weak personality development and poor
self-control. The thesis that personality disorder is responsible for child abuse
was further advanced by reports that abusers often had a propensity for
impulsive and/ or anti-social acts that extended beyond the preventing role. A
parent, according to this explanation, may abuse his/ her child due to unmet
emotional needs (that signify discontentment, anger or irritability), an inability
to balance the child’s needs and capabilities with own (parental) expectations, or
emotional scars from their own abusive or deprived family background
affecting their ability to care for their own offspring (Wolfe, 1987: 45). </p>
<p>
    This explanation initially drew support from many fields, including law
makers and public interest groups because it directed most of the responsi-
bility for abusive behaviour squarely at the individual involved, and absolved
soceity from blame in contributing to the risk of child abuse through lack of
education, adequate housing, family support programmes, employment
opportunities, and so on. However, recent researches have disproved the role
of psychopathology in child abuse. </p>
<p>
    The socio-cultural explanation, given in the 1970s, maintained that
external forces or socio-demographic variables within the society caused child
abuse. This explanation includes three sub-explanations: social situational,
social habitability and social control. </p>
<p>
   The social- situational explanation proposes that abuse and violence arise
out of two factors: structural stress and cultural norms. As the social structure
in which a parent lives becomes more stress ridden (or is perceived as more
stressful), the greater becomes the possibility that family violence will surface
as an attempt to gain control over irritating, tense events. Cultural sanctioning
of violence as an appropriate conflict resolution technique further provides a
foundation for the use of corporal punishment in child rearing. If a parent was
frequently exposed to harsh physical punishment as a child, he/ she may have
greater propensity toward viewing such behaviour as normative and
inhibition against physical force may be lessened (Bandura, 1973). Steinmetz
and Straus (1974) have maintained that factors such as low income,
unemployment, isolation, unwanted pregnancy and conflict with
spouse/in-laws, cause structural stresses which, combined with the cultural
acceptance for violence to resolve conflict, lead to the use of force and violence
against children at home. Talking of social factors which cause stress, Gil
(1970) referred to social class and family size, Light (1973: 556-98) has  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000258">258</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
 referred to unemployment, and Garbarino (1977: 721-35) has referred to
social isolation. </p>
<p>
The major problem in this explanation according to Fieldman (1982) is
that it is unable to account for the finding that given the same set of deprivation
or adverse conditions, many parents do and others do not abuse their children. </p>
<p>
The social habitability explanation was proposed by James Garbarino in
1977. According to him, the nature of child maltreatment depends upon the
quality of the environment in which the person and family live, or the level of
family support in the environment. The lesser the family support the greater
the risk of maltreatment of children. </p>
<p>
The social control explanation was propounded by Gelles in 1973.
According to him, parents use violence against their children because they
have no fear of being hit back, nor of being arrested (unless some neighbour
lodges a complaint with the police). Thus, violence is used when (i) the cost of
being violent is to be less than the rewards, (ii) the absence of effective social
control over family relations decreases the cost (of one member being violent
towards another), and (iii) family structures reduce social control in family
relations and, therefore, reduce the costs and increase the rewards of being
violent (Gelles and Cornell, 1985: 121). Laslett (1978: 480) has also said that (a)
inequality in home reduces both social control and the costs of being violent,
and (b) the privacy in the family serves to reduce the degree of social control
exercised over family relations. Gelles (1973) has maintained that certain types
of children—like the handicapped, ugly, demanding, premature—are at a
greater risk of being abused by their parents. This is because either they make
great demands (economically, socially or psychologically) on their parents or
they are perceived as not providing sufficient gratification in return for the
parents’ investment of time and energy. Thus, when a parent perceives the
costs of parenthood to outweigh the rewards, he uses violence against his
children. Ivan Nye (1979) like Gelles, had also earlier accepted the application
of Peter Blau’s theory, in explaining child abuse. He has proposed that child
beating is less common in families that have relatives and/ or friends near by.
Recasting Nye’s proposition, Gelles and Cornell (1985) have proposed that
child beating is more common when relatives, friends and neighbours (that is,
non-family members) are unavailable, unable or unwilling to be part of the
daily system of family interaction, and thus unable to serve as agents of formal
and informal social control. Gelles has further maintained that the greater the
disparity between perceived investment in a family relationship (that is,
parenting) and the perceived returns on the investment, the greater the
likelihood that there will be violence. This also explains why children of five
to seven years of age are more likely victims of child abuse than children of 14 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000259">259</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:259
</h1>
<p>
to 16 years of age. Parents of younger children perceive a rather large
investment in their children and feel that they get little in the way of actual
return than parents of older children. </p>
<p>
   This explanation has been criticized on the following grounds: (1) It is
preposterous to assume that relations between parents and children are based
on reciprocity and that parents’ treatment of children is determined in terms
of calculations of rewards and costs. (2) Assuming it is so, why do all the
parents not make such calculations and only a few do it, that is, why do all the
parents not beat their children and only some parents indulge in
child beating? Does this not ignore the personality factor in the use of
violence? (3) Why are children who work and earn also beaten by their
parents (like non-working children) when there is some 'return' of
'parenting’? </p>
<p>
   The resource explanation was given by William Goode in 1971.
According to it, the use of force by an individual depends upon the extent to
which he can command or master the resources—social, personal and
economic. The more resources a person has, the less he will use force in an
open manner. Thus, a father who wants to be a dominant person in the family
but has little education, low prestige job, low income and lacks interpersonal
skills, may choose to use violence against his children to maintain the
dominant position. </p>
<p>
   The social interactional explanation was given by R.L. Burgess in 1979. It
approches the etiology of child abuse in terms of the interplay between
individual family and social factors in relation to both past (for example,
exposure to abuse as a child) and present (for example, a demanding child)
events. The parents’ learning history, interpersonal experiences, and intrinsic
capabilities are regarded as predisposing characteristics presumed to be
important contributors to an abusive pattern. In this explanation, the
potential role of a child in provoking abuse is also acknowledged. The condi-
tions under which a child is reared and the methods used by the parents,
particularly their punitive methods, may help to explain why some adults are
predisposed abusive behaviour, given certain setting conditions. </p>
<p>
  Although this explanation is primarily concerned with the current
behaviour of the abusive parent in the context of the family or community,
psychological mechanisms such as perceptions and interpretations of events,
are also recognized as important factors in influencing the parent-child inter-
actions (Wolfe, 1987: 49). The interactional explanation, thus, is not
necessarily limited to observable behaviour alone (like parental criticisms or
displays of anger, etc.) but includes cognitive and effective processes too (like
intelligence, attitudes, etc.) that may mediate behavioural changes. </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000260">260</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:260
</h1>
<p>
The social learning explanation lays emphasis on the learned nature of
parenting and the fact that many parents have insufficient knowledge and skill
to equip them to carry out the highly complex task of child rearing. They not
only lack fundamental skills (of rearing children) but there may also be an
absence of coping strategies to deal with stress, giving rise to a spiralling effect
of increased stress and less effective coping. </p>

<h1> The Victims of Abuse </h1>
<p>
An empirical study was conducted in Rajasthan in 1990 on child abuse by G.S.
Kewalramani to assess the nature, extent, patterns and causes of abuse, to
delineate the characteristics of perpetrators and victims of abuse, and to
analyse the effect of abuse on a child’s role performance and his/ her devel-
opment. The study was focused on 167 children in the age group of 10-16
years. Of the 167 cases studied, 124 were cases of physical abuse, 23 of sexual
abuse and 103 of emotional abuse (the total is more than the cases studies
because many children were victims of multiple abuse). Further, of the total
cases studied, 61.7 per cent were boys and 38.3 per cent were girls. Amongst
boys, 42.7 per cent were working and 57.3 per cent were non-working, while
amongst girls, 46.9 per cent were working and 53.1 per cent were
non-working. The age groups of the interviewed children were. 10-11
years—20.4 per cent, 12—13 years—25.7 per cent, 14— 15 years—24. 6 per cent,
and 16 years—29.3 per cent.  </p>
<p>
The important findings of this study on the three types of child abuse,
namely, physical, sexual and emotional, were as follows:   </p>

<h1> Physical Abuse </h1>
<p>
(1) Boys are more battered than girls (ratio being 1.3: 1). (2) School-going
children run greater risk of being physically abused than those who do not go
to school. (3) Older children (14-16 years) are more abused physically than
younger children (10—13 years). (4) Non-working children are beaten more
than the working children. (5) The ratio of children who are occasionally
abused (twice or thrice a month) to those who are frequently abused (once or
twice a week), or very frequently abused (three or four times a week) is  1:5.5.
(6) A large number of the abused children (about 60%) belong to poor
families. Only a small number (about 2%) belong to well-to-do families. This
shows that there is a significant relationship between poverty and physical
abuse. (7) In a very large number of cases (93%), the perpetrators of physical
abuse are members of the family (father, mother, sibling). (8) Perpetrators of
either sex abuse children of their own sex more than of the opposite sex. (9)
Mothers abuse children physically more (60%) than the fathers (40%).  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000261">261</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:261
</h1>
<p>
However, males abuse children more severely than females. (10) A great
majority of the abuser parents are in their thirties and forties, while the
siblings are mostly in their teens. (11) The main modes of battering children
are slapping and beating with fists (40%), hitting with different objects (35%),
kicking (19%), choking and/ or strangulating (10%), binding with rope (3%),
and tearing hair (2%). (12) In most of the cases (85%), the beating does not
cause an injury to the child. (13) The physical violence against children is of
various types. Routine beating is different from the non-routine beating. The
former is one which the parents believe their children ‘deserve’, and the
children also believe that they ‘asked for it’. The latter is one which is insti-
gated by the child. Secondary violence is one which one parent believes is just
and legitimate but the other parent believes is unjust.</p>
<p>
    Non-routine violence has been sub-categorized as volcanic violence,
alcohol-related violence, sex-related or jealousy-oriented violence, expressive
violence, power-oriented or instrumental violence, and victim-precipitated
violence. Volcanic violence is one which is used neither for achieving a desired
end nor for legitimizing the act. It occurs when the victimizer (parent,
employer, etc.) has run out of patience as the result of externally caused stress,
such as losing the job or being insulted by somebody or incurring a loss.
Alcohol-related violence is one where violence is the result of alcohol
consumption. Alcohol releases aggression as well as makes a person irrational
and serves as a disinhibitory agent that releases violence impulses. This type of
violence is exclusively male violence. Jealousy-oriented or sex-related violence
is one in which the parent of one sex beats the child of the other sex out of
jealousy. Stepfather beating his daughter, or stepmother beating her son are
examples of this type of violence. </p>
<p>
   Expressive violence is one in which the use of physical force is an end in
it self. Instrumental or power-oriented violence is one in which violence is
intended not only as a means of inducing the child to alter his behaviour but
also to establish parental authority. Child precipitated violence is one in
which the victims of violence contribute to their own victimization either
through actions defined as deviant by the aggressor parent or through
provoking their (parents) antagonism
</p>
<h1> Sexual Abuse </h1>
<p>
    Girls are more victims of sexual abuse than boys (the ratio being 2.3: 1).(2) A
high proportion of children become victims of sexual abuse when they are
fourteen or above 14 years of age. The ratio of victims below 14 years to victims
above 14 years is about 1: 5. (3) There is a strong association between sex and the
number of abusers. Males are usually abused sexually by one person while girls </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000262">262</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:262
</h1>
<p>
are generally assaulted by more than one person. (4) There is rarely an appli-
cation of force or bodily harm. Victims are usually psychologically enticed by
the assaulters by loyalty to, affection for, and the dependence on them (abusers).
(5) The victims of sexual abuse are generally from the lower socio-economic
families. (6) Sexual abuse of children does not demonstrate a relationship with
religion and caste membership. There is some evidence that the low caste
women are more frequent victims of sexual assault than the high caste women
but this refers more to rape cases than childhood sexual abuse. (7) Whereas the
victims’ age distribution is more homogeneous, the assaulters’ age distribution is
more heterogeneous (very young, young, early middle age, late middle age).(8)
In about two-third cases (66.7%), the perpetrators have secondary relationship
with the victims (employers, co—workers, teachers, tenants, and acquaintances).
Persons having blood relationships constitute a small category of perpetrators.
In other words, a significant percentage of child sexual abuse (93%) occurs
outside the family. (9) Boys are generally the victims of ‘employment-related'
abuse while girls are generally the victims of ‘acquaintance—related’ abuse.(10) Of
the 'employment-related' sexual abuse, two-thirds is by the co—workers and
one-third is by the employers. </p>

<h1> Emotional Abuse </h1>
<p>
(1) Boys are more emotionally maltreated than girls, the ratio being 1.3:1.(2)
Working children are as much neglected as non-working children.(3)
School-going children are a little more maltreated than non—school-going
children. (4) Of the various forms of emotional abuse, constant lack of super-
vision is as high as 62 per cent. Belittling is found in 50 per cent cases, false
blaming among 33 per cent, lack of concern for studies and welfare in 28 per
cent, rejection among 18 per cent and unequal treatment with siblings in 17
per cent cases. (5) The ratio of parents taking ‘no’ interest, ‘less’ interest and
‘average’ interest in children is about 5: 3: 1. (6) In a large number of cases
(76%), the parents who neglect the child are those whose income is low and
liabilities are many; who are middle aged, illiterate or less educated; and who
are engaged in low-status jobs. (7) A large number of parents who ill-treat their
children are those who are aggressive, irritable and domineering in their
behavioural characteristics; fickle-minded, inflexible and less tolerant in their
emotional characteristics; and have low esteem, feeling of alienation, and lack
of ability to empathize in social characteristics. </p>

<h1> Causes of Child Abuse </h1>
<p>
The major cause of child abuse is adaptational failure or environmental malad-
justment (both in family and workplace) mostly on the part of the adult </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000263">263</pagenum>

<p>
perpetrators (parents, employers, etc.) but to some extent on the part of adults
responsible for family socialization as well (Kewalramani, 1992: 152). Before
discussing this thesis, let us first analyse the causes of three different types of
child abuse separately. </p>

<h1> Physical Abuse </h1>
<p>
Different scholars have suggested different causes of physical abuse. Some
consider the psycho-pathology of the individual perpetrators as the primary
cause, others view the psycho-social pathology of family interaction as the
main cause, and still others put major emphasis on situations of acute stress.
The empirical study of Kewalramani conducted in Rajasthan, however,
revealed that stress factors associated with families give a sufficient causal
explation for child abuse. The situational stresses pointed out four models
of dominant causes of a child’s physical abuse: (a) relations between spouses,
(b) relations between parents and children, (c) structural stresses, and (d)
child-produced stress.  </p>
<p>
The dominant causes of battering children were found as: children
constantly disobeying parents (35%), quarrels between the parents and the
child beaten as scapegoat (19%), child not taking interest in studies (9%), child
spending most of his time away from home (8%), child refusing to go to earn a
livelihood (7%), child frequently fighting with siblings (5%), child frequently
playing truant from school (5%), child refusing to hand over his total earnings
parents/guardians (5%), receiving complaints of misbehaviour from
outsiders (4%), and child indulging in deviant behaviour like theft, smoking,
etc.(3%). All these factors (disobeying parents, quarrels between parents,
spending most of the time away from home, child not taking interest in
studies or work, etc.) do not point so much to the personality defects in the
individual perpetrators as to the major factors leading to child abuse. It may,
therefore, be said that though the role of the personality traits of the abusers
cannot be ignored, family environment and stress-ridden family situations are
more crucial factors in child battering.  </p>

<h1> Sexual abuse </h1>
<p>
The four causes of sexual abuse mostly given are: adjustment problems of the
perpetrators, family disorganization, victim’s characteristics, and the psycho-
logical disorders of the abusers. Kewalramani’s study (1992: 78) on child
abuse, however, approached the problem of sexual abuse with a ‘systems
model' and perceived it as behaviour influenced by factors at several different
levels,that is, a behaviour which is the result of cumulative influence of a set
of factors. In fact, this study used the systems approach not to study sexual </p>

<p>
abuse but also physical and emotional abuse. The four variables related to
sexual abuse were: family environment, family structure, individual predispo
sitions and situational factors. </p>
<p>
The analysis of family environment revealed that congestion in family
was not related to sexual abuse but conflict between parents and weakening of
inhibitions leading to neglect of the children, absence of affectionate
parent-child relationship within the family that fails to give support and
protection to child, alcoholism of the earning male member, his lack of
accountability, lack of adequate control on the children, illicit relations of the
mother with some man and paramour’s hold on his mistress, dominance of
stepfather, and social isolation of the family (that is, family not participating
in social networks or community activities) were factors which were more
important in sexual abuse.  </p>
<p>
The environment in the workplace also contributes to sexual moles-
tation. Several cases of assault by employers and molestation by co-workers of
the young victims when they were all alone in the house/workplace/school
were found in Kewalramani’s study. The loneliness of young girls make them
more vulnerable to the overtures of the perpetrators.  </p>

<h1> Emotional Abuse </h1>
<p>
Four important causes of emotional abuse can be identified. poverty, 'defi-
cient’ parental control and non-cordial relations within family,
maltreatment faced by parents in their own childhood or intergenerational
transmission of child maltreatment, and alcoholism of parents
Kewalramani also found these factors important in emotional abuse. More
than half of the abuser parents (55%) had low income and 5—12 familly
members to support. Strauss (1979) and Deschner (1984) have also pointed
out the effect of poverty on child abuse. However, it has now come to be
believed that child abuse is not exclusively a lower SES (socio—economic
status) situation, though it is predominantly a lower SES problem. ‘Defi
cient’ parental control was found by Kewalramani in 52 per cent cases and
intergenerational transmission of maltreatment was discovered in 79 per
cent cases. Pagelow (1984) has also referred to the role of inter-generational
transmission in child maltreatment. However, Burgess and Youngblad
(1985) have questioned this belief. Lastly, Kewalramani did not find alcohol
as an important factor in child abuse. He found only 26 per cent parents
(fathers) as alcoholic of whom 44 per cent consumed alcohol every day, this
is, were addicts. Matlins (1981) has, however, described the alcoholic parents
as having an important role in child abuse.  </p>

<h1>
Integrated Model of the Causes of Child Abuse, Page no:	265
</h1>
<p>
The major premise of this model is the interdependence between parent, child
and situation. This model focuses on four factors in child abuse: (i) family
environment, (ii) structural stresses, (iii) individual characteristics of parents,
and (iv) sub-cultural learning. The model requires knowledge in five different
areas: (i) child development, (ii) socialization processes, (iii) family interac-
tiions, (iv) learning principles, and (v) sources of arousing anger, aggression,
satred, and so forth. </p>

<p>  These areas point out that: </p>
<p>
(a) Child abuse can be viewed in terms of the degree to which a parent uses
negative or inappropriate control strategies with his/ her child.
Employing “normal methods (meeting all the child’s needs, adequate
control, positive disciplining, and clear communication) contributes to a
child’s (social, emotional and intellectual) development, whereas taking
recourse to ‘abnormal’ methods (neglecting child’s needs, inadequate
control, negative disciplining, unclear communication, and over-reliance
on coercion) in child rearing inhibits a child’s development and causes
child abuse. </p>
<p>
  Authoritative parenting (the commanding type of parents), authori-
tarian parenting (requiring complete obedience to their authority),
indulgent parenting (gratifying all desires/ fancies), and negligent
parenting (being indifferent and unresponsive and not paying due
attention) influence a child’s characteristics and behaviour. The authori-
tarian  parental style is most harmful and is conducive to child abuse. </p>
<p>
(b) Stress also give rise to maladaptive coping responses, since abusive
parents are clearly not violent under all circumstances. Factors like
unemployment and dissatisfaction with job affect an individual’s
behaviour which lead to child abuse. </p>
<p>
(c) Individual characteristics of parents like inherent traits (irritable nature,
self-centredness, rigidness, etc.), lack of parenting skill, and lack of
resources (low prestige, little education and low income) also cause child
abuse
</p>
<p>
The sub-cultural learning, that is, socialization in a violent home, or
experiencing violence in childhood, is yet another cause of child abuse.
All these factors together explain how they affect the behaviour of the
perpetrators which ultimately leads to child abuse. </p>

<h1> Effects Abuse on Children </h1>
<p>
That are the effects of abuse—physical, sexual, social and emotional—on
children. Bolton and Bolton (1987: 93—113) have identified eight possible </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000266">266</pagenum>
<h1>
PaGE No:266
</h1>
<p>
effects of abuse on children, namely, self-devaluation, dependency, mistrust,
revictimization, withdrawal from people, emotional trauma, deviant
behaviour, and interpersonal problems. </p>
<p>
Kewalramani’s study of child abuse lays down the effect of abuse on
children in five significant areas. The first is the loss of self-esteem. Abused
children develop a negative view of themselves. Elmer (1987) has called is
‘self—devaluation’ while Egeland, Sroufe and Erickson (1983: 460) have called is
‘low self-esteem’. Kinard (1980: 686—696) has mentioned it as 'poor
self-concept’ and Hjorth and Ostrov (1982: 71— 72) as ‘poor self-image’.
Children have no choice but to accept the perpetrators’ abuse. The individual
who maltreats them is their own parent so they cannot run away. Similarly,
they have to tolerate their caretakers’ and employers’ hostility because of their
poverty and their dependence on them. </p>
<p>
Kewalramani used three indicators to test his hypothesis (ibid.: 114) that
child’s self— esteem is devalued by his abuse. These indicators were: child’s own
evaluation of his/ her performance at school (in the case of the school- going
children), evaluation as worker (in the case of the working children), and
evaluation as a helper at home. He framed five questions pertaining to these
indicators and found that: (i) A high percentage of children (75%) who were
physically/ emotionally abused felt that they were weak at studies and/ or had
to make more than one attempt to pass the examination. (ii) A high
percentage (84%) considered themselves to be indifferent towards their work
and/ or felt dissatisfied with the work they were engaged in. (iii) An equally
high percentage (86%) thought of themselves as shirkers than as helpers to
their parents/ caretakers in the routine household chores. From these, it may
be inferred that abuse always devalues a child’s self-esteem. </p>
<p>
The second effect is on dependency. It was found that a child's
dependency is shifted from parents/ caretakers to teachers for the gratification
of all his/ her needs. The three indicators to operationalize dependency were
gratification of physical needs (food, clothes and medicare), emotional and
social support, and need of working somewhere to earn money. It was found
that (i) a good number of child victims (50%) had a feeling that their physical
needs were not being met to their satisfaction; (ii) a high percentage of victims
(55%) found themselves dependent on others for their emotional and social
support; and (iii) a still higher percentage (63%) of abused children were forced
to take up a job to meet their needs. However, significantly, despite the abuse,
a good number of victimized children continued to depend on their
parents/ caretakers than on others. </p>
<p>
The third effect is on deviant behaviour. It was found that abuse had a
great effect on a child’s conformity to socio—cultural expectations and a large </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000267">267</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:267
</h1>
<p>
number of the victimized children were compelled to indulge in activities that
violated the social norms or which are labelled as ‘deviance’. The five indicators
used by Kewalramani (ibid.: 128) to study the effect of child abuse on deviance
were: absence from school, absence from work, drug addiction, stealing money,
and hostile reactions towards perpetrators. The study revealed that (i) A high
percentage of emotionally and sexually abused victims (58% to 80%) missed
their school frequently. (ii) About three-fourths of the victims (74% to 77%)
frequently remained absent from work. (iii) About one-tenth of the victims (8%
to 10%) had either become drug addicts or had started smoking or taking
tobacco or consuming alcohol. (iv) About one-fifth of the victims (18%) had
started stealing money. (v) A large number of the victims (48% to 78%) had
developed hostility and aggressiveness towards the perpetrators. From all this, it
may be inferred that child abuse causes deviance amongst the victims which
varies with regard to its magnitude and type. </p>
<p>
The fourth effect is on social and interpersonal problems. Kewalramani’s
study (ibid.: 136) revealed that child abuse results in poor communication and
coping ability, failure in developing intimacy and social relationships,
mistrust, isolation and withdrawal from interactional settings. For verifying
these effects, the questions asked from the victims related to their free time
activities, relations with parents and siblings, what constitutes embarrassing
situations, their confiding in friends in times of stress and their desire to
abandon their families. It was found that. (i) Most of the victims (68% to 83%)
avoided situations in which interaction would have been expected, that is,
they preferred to live in solitude and passed their leisure time all alone. (ii)
Only a low percentage of the victims wanted to dissociate themselves from or
abandon the family. (iii) A high percentage of the victims (76%) had indif-
ferent or antagonistic relations with their parents/ caretakers and/ or siblings.
(iv) Only a small number of the victims (24%) had a friend/ relative whom
they could trust and share their sorrows with. (v) Abuse caused embar-
rassment but its range differed in relation to the type of abuse. All these
observations point out that victims—of child abuse always develop certain
types of social and interpersonal problems. </p>
<p>
The last effect (of child abuse) is on revictimization, that is, the child
once abused will essentially be abused time and again. The three indicators
used by Kewalramani in this context in his study were: frequency of abuse,
number of abusing perpetrators, and number of ways or forms of child abuse.
The three questions related to these three indicators were how frequently
the victim abused, whether he was abused by one or more persons
whether he was abused in one way or in more than one way. </p>
<p>
The study revealed that (i) a high percentage of children (659)
were abused regularly or frequently, (ii) a large number of victims. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000268">268</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:268
</h1>
<p>
of physical and emotional abuse (but not sexual) were abused by more than one
person, and (iii) a large number of victims of physical and emotional abuse(66%
to 80%) were victimized in more than one way. From all this, it may be inferred
that a child who is a victim of abuse once is not only abused frequently and by
more than one person but is also at a greater risk of being victimized in more
than one way, that is, physically, emotionally and sexually.  </p>

                         <h1> Child Labour </h1>
<p>
Child labourers are exploited, exposed to hazardous work conditions and paid
a pittance for their long hours of work. Forced to forego education, shoul-
dering responsibilities far beyond their years, becoming worldly-wise when
their peers have yet to leave the cocoons of parental protection, these children
never know what childhood is. The Indian Constitution enshrines that:
0 No child below the age of 14 years shall be employed to work in any
  factory or in any hazardous employment (Article 24).

0 Childhood and youth are to be protected against exploitation and
  against moral and material abandonment (Article 39(f)).

° The state shall endeavour to provide within a period of 10 years from
the commencement of the Constitution free and compulsory
education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years
(Article 45).  </p>

<h1> Incidence of Child Labour in India </h1>
<p>
Of the total population of 1,029 million in 2001, about 364 million(or
35.35%) were children below the age of 14 years. Those in the age group of
5-14 years were about 256 million (or 24.60%) (Premi, 2011: 79—80). There is
thus a perceptible decline in the proportion of children in the age group 0-14
years from 1971 onwards, mainly due to decline in birth rates. </p>
<p>
Although the number of child labour globally has declined by one- third
since 2000 from 246 million to 168 million—it is not enough to achieve the
goal of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016 agreed by interna-
tional community through the International Labour Organization (ILO) .
Millions of children from poor families are still compelled by economic
considerations to join labour force. A new ILO report, Making Progress
Against Child Labour (2013) says that the largest absolute number of child
labourers is found in the Asia-Pacific region (almost 78 million), but
Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region with the highest incidence of
child labour in terms of proportion of the population, at over 21 per cent. The
incidence of child labour is highest in poorer countries but middle-income
countries have the largest numbers of child labourers. Child labour among </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000269">269</pagenum>

Page no:269
</h1>
<p>
girls fell by 40 per cent since 2000, compared to 25 per cent for boys.
Agriculture remains by far the most important sector where child labourers
can be found (98 million children, or 59%), but the problems are not negli-
gible in services (54 million) and industry (12 million)- mostly in the informal
economy. </p>
<p>
   Between 2008 and 2012, child labour among children aged 5-17 years
declined in Asia and the Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean and
Sub-Saharan Africa regions. Asia and the Pacific registered by far the largest
decline, from 114 million in 2008 to 78 million in 2012. The number of child
labourers also decreased in Sub-Saharan Africa (by 6 million), and modestly in
Latin America and the Caribbean (by 1.6 million). There are 9.2 million child
labourers  in the Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p>
In India, as per the 2001 Census, there were 12.60 million working
children in the age group of 5—14 years as compared to 11.30 million in 1991
revealing an increasing trend in absolute numbers though the work partici-
pation rates of children (5—14) has come down from 5.4 percent during 1991
to 5 percent during 2001. The recent round of the National Sample Survey
Organization (NSSO) estimates suggests that the child labour in the country is
around 8.9 million in 2004—05 with a workforce participation rate of 3. 4 per
cent. However, due to definitional problems, a substantial proportion of child
labour may remain uncounted. </p>
<p>
Census data further shows that there is a decline in the absolute number
as well as the percentage of main workers of children (5—14 to total population in
that age group from 4.3% in 1991 to 2.3% in 2001). But there was a substantial
increase in marginal workers in every category of workers, irrespective of sex
and residence. As a result, despite the number of main workers declining from
9.08 million in 1991 to 5.78 million in 2001, the total number of children in
the workforce increased. A large part of the increase was accounted for by the
increase in marginal workers, which increased from 2.2 million in 1991 to 6.89
million in 2001. Main and marginal workers put together, the work partici-
pation rate (WPR) of children in the 5— 14 age group has declined from 5.4
per cent  durinng 1991 to 5 percent in 2001. The trends between 1991 and 2001
of declining main child workers along with increasing marginal workers may
indicate the changing nature of work done by children. There is a general
trend marginalization of labour force in the country and this is also
reflected in the census figures. This is to be seen in the context of decelerating
employment growth in general in the economy during the last decade that is
characterized as an era of globalization. </p>
<p>
The first Act to regulate the employment of children and their hours of
work was the Factory Act of 1881. A commission was appointed in 1929 to
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000270">270</pagenum>

Page no:270
</h1>
<p>
fix the minimum age of Child employment. On its recommendation, the
Child Labour Act, 1933 was passed prohibiting employment of children
below 14 years of age. The Factory Act of 1948 provided some safeguard to
child labourers. In 1986, the parliament enacted the Child Labour Act
(Regulation and Prohibition), prohibiting the employment of children's Acts
certain jobs and regulating the conditions of work in hazardous occupations.
The Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 which superseded the existing Children’s Acts
in different states and union territories and came into force from October 2,
1987, provides for the creation of Advisory Boards and the establishment of
State Children Funds for preventing the abuse of children, for the protection
and care of children, for the mobilization of resources and for the provision of
facilities for education, training and rehabilitation of the neglected children.
But, in spite of all these measures, children continue to be employed, harassed
and abused.  </p>

<h1> Nature of Child Work </h1>
<p>
Thus, India has the largest number of child workers in the world. They are
employed in many industries and trades, including garments, footwear, bricks
kilns, stainless steel, hotels and textile shops. Many work in export- oriented
hazardous industries like carpet weaving, gem polishing, glass blowing,
firecrackers units, match works, brassware, electro-plating, lead mining, stone
quarrying, lock-making and beedi-rolling, and in tea gardens. In addition,
nearly 85 per cent of child labourers in India are hard-to-reach, invisible and
excluded, as they work largely in the unorganized sector, both rural and
urban, within the family or in household-based units, which are generally out
of the purview of labour laws.  </p>
<p>
According to an ILP report on child labour in India, based on 2001
census, the distribution of total workforce aged 5— 14 years in different
industry categories at all-India level shows that the maximum number of
children (i.e., 48%) are employed in manufacturing sector, followed by
agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (20%), and wholesale/ retail trade
(10%). The number of children in urban areas, who work in restaurants and
canteens, or those engaged in picking rags and hawking goods, is vast but
unrecorded. And, among the more unfortunate ones are those who are
employed in hazardous industries like fireworks and match box units
According to a study conducted by the National Commission for Protection
of Children Rights (2013), approximately 70 per cent firecrackers and matches
produced in India are from Sivakasi. In 2011, Sivakasi was home to over 9,500
firecracker factories and produced almost 90 per cent of total fireworks and
500 match factories fulfilling 75 per cent demand of matches in the country. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000271">271</pagenum>

<p>
 Tamil Nadu has been in limelight for long in terms for its child labour
problem where innocent children fall prey to the exploitative labour in
firecrackers and match industries. Every year, there occur many fire accidents
in these units in which a number of labourers, including children, die. </p>
<p>
Mostly children in the age group of 5—15 work for more than 12 hours a
day and earn paltry sum as wages. They are generally paid on a piecerate basis,
which is very low and thus they are indirectly forced to work faster and
longer affecting their health and nutrition. Most of the children are found
ignorant of the benefits of education which include decent living without any
damage to their health and development. There are also health consequences.
Asthma, eye infection and TB are prevalent among 90 per cent of children
who are involved in gun powder filling and are directly in contact with the
chemical ingredients of crackers and matches. These workers usually do not
wear any protective clothes and their whole skins are normally covered with
the chemicals such as sulphur, aluminium powder and gun powder. </p>
<p>
Similarly, in a study report on children in Indian carpet industry,
commissioned by the International Labour Rights Fund, it is found that
children account for 7.13 per cent of the total workforce. Most of the children
(82%) working on looms are boys, and the majority (58%) of them belong to
the labour families. Not only this, the proportion of child labour to the total
workforce is higher in the Persian variety of carpets. Though, according the
study, compared to the 1990s, there has been a decline in the magnitude of
child labour in the carpet industry, but this is not to the extent of claims made
by the government and industry sources. </p>
<p>
The surveys of the metropolitan and mega cities make shocking revela-
tions. Mumbai has the largest number of child labourers. Even in Delhi, more
than one lakh children work in dhabas, tea stalls and restaurants on a daily
wage of Rs 50 or Rs 100. In the mining sector, about half the workers are
children below 15. In most cases, children are favoured as they are docile and
hence can be exploited. </p>
<p>
Child labour is inextricably linked to bonded labour. In Andhra
pradesh ,21 per cent of the bonded labourers are under sixteen. In Karnataka,
10.3 Per cent and in Tamil Nadu 8.7 per cent belong to this age group. A study
shows that at the time of entering bondage, many labourers are as young as
five years old. In Odisha, one common way of clearing debt is to sell
daughters, 8 to 10 years old, as maid servants, to the creditor. In several parts
of the country, bonded fathers, over 40 years old, free themselves by deputing
their sons into bondage. </p>
<p>
 In the tea gardens of Assam, where employment of children below 12
years is prohibited, girls who bring food to their working mothers are </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000272">272</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:272
</h1>
<p>
encouraged to stay back and help with the work. Children, mostly boys, have
an important role to play in mining operations. While men do the digging
inside the pits, boys carry coal to the surface. Children below 12 are preferred
because their height allows them to walk without bending in the tunnels.
Preference for child workers is most common in the unorganized sector
because here it is relatively easy for employers to circumvent laws. Children
are concealed from factory inspectors during inspection, their ages are raised
arbitrarily to make them eligible for employment, or those eligible for adult
wages are denied their legitimate share because the employers lower their age
in the forms. </p>

<h1> Causes of Child Labour </h1>
<p>
In a country like India where one in five persons is living, below poverty line,
child labour is a complex issue. Children work out of necessity and with out
their earnings (however meagre they may be), a family cannot survive. A large
number of them do not even have families or cannot count on them for
support. In these circumstances, the alternative to work may be idleness, desti-
tution, or worse, crime.  </p>
<p>
Employers give certain justifications for employing children to suppress
their guilt feelings. They say that the work keeps children away from
starvation. They are prevented from committing crimes which they would
have indulged in if they had no jobs. The bureaucrats hold that the total eradi-
cation of child labour is not feasible because the government cannot provide
substantial alternative employment to them. The social scientists say that the
main cause of child labour is poverty. The children either supplement their
parents’ income or are the only wage earners in the family. According to
Planning Commission of India’s poverty estimates for 2011— 12, released in July
2013, 21.9 per cent of the total population of India or about 270 million people
live below poverty line. Of these, 217 million (25.7%) are living in rural areas
and 53 million (13.7%) in urban areas. The highest number of persons living
below the poverty line are found in Uttar Pradesh (5.98 crore), followed by
Bihar (3.58 crore), Madhya Pradesh (2. 34 crore) and Maharashtra (1.98 crore).
These persons are forced to send their children to work in factories, etc.
Another reason is that child labour is deliberately created by vested interests to
get cheap labour. The third reason forwarded for the existence of child labour is
that it benefits industries, such as the carpet industry, which earns crores of
rupees in foreign exchange by exporting carpets. </p>

<h1> Working Conditions of Child Labourers </h1>
<p>
Children work in dangerously polluted factories whose brick walls are scarred
with soot (black powder in smoke) and there is an oppressive smell in the air. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000273">273</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:273
</h1>
<p>
They work near furnaces which burn at a temperature of 1400 degree centigrade.
They handle dangerous chemicals like arsenic and potassium. They work in
glass blowing units where the work exerts their lungs and creates diseases like
tuberculosis. </p>
<p>
Among the working children, many are the main or major wage earners
in the family who always remain worried about feeding their dependents. The
migrant child workers whose parents live in some far off city or village are
generally in despair. Some work for 9 to 10 hours including night shifts. Even
when the factories are fully functional, they are paid not more than Rs 3,000
per month, all of which they hand over to their ‘guardians’ who do not give
them even a rupee a day for tea during the night shift. There are times when
their bodies ache, minds fog, hearts cry, spirits bleed, but on orders of the
employer they work for 10 to 11 hours at a stretch. </p>
<p>
   A visit to several factories in Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and
Maharashtra reveals that a large number of child workers have sunken chests
and thin bone frames which give them a fragile look. They look like rag dolls,
limp, unwashed and scraggy. They wear coarse and badly tailored clothes.
Many of them have scabies on hands, arms and legs. The heads of a few are
tonsured probably because the skin on their skull has developed severe infec-
tions. </p>
<p>
 A large number of the child workers are virtually confined in small rooms
under inhuman conditions and in the most unhygienic surroundings. Most of
these children come from extremely poor households. They are either school
drop- outs or have not seen any school at all. They earn a very meagre wage
and work in most unsafe conditions. The hazardous conditions take their toll.
Children suffer from lung diseases, tuberculosis, eye diseases, asthma,
brochitis and backaches. Some are injured in fire accidents. Many become
unemployable even at the age of 20. If injured or incapacitated, they are
discarded mercilessly by their employers. </p>

<h1> Ameliorating Child Labour in India </h1>
<p>
The problem of child labour continues to pose a big challenge before the
nation. The government has been taking various pro-active measures to tackle
this problem. However, considering the magnitude and extent of the problem
and that it is essentially a socio-economic problem inextricably linked to
poverty and illiteracy, it requires concerted efforts from all sections of the
society to make a dent in the problem. </p>
<p>
According to the Census 2001 figures there are 1.26 crore working
children  in the age group of 5—14 as compared to the total child population of
25.2 crore. There are approximately 12 lakh children working in the  </p>

<p>
hazardous occupations/ processes which are covered under the Child Labour
(Prohibition & Regulation) Act, i.e., 18 occupations and 65 processes.
However, as per survey conducted by National Sample Survey Organization
(NSSO) in 2004—05, the number of working children is estimated at 90.75
lakh. It shows that the efforts of the government have borne the desired fruits.  </p>
<p>
 Over the years, the Government of India has multiplied its efforts to
address the needs and rights of exploited children. Way back in 1979,the
Central Government formed the first committee called Gurupadswamy
Committee to study the issue of child labour and to suggest measures to tackle
it. The Committee examined the problem in detail and made some
far-reaching recommendations. It observed that as long as poverty continued,
it would be difficult to totally eliminate child labour and hence, any attempt
to abolish it through legal recourse would not be a practical proposition. The
Committee felt that in the circumstances, the only alternative left was to ban
child labour in hazardous areas and to regulate and ameliorate the conditions
of work in other areas. It recommended that a multiple policy approach was
required in dealing with the problems of working children. </p>
<p>
Based on the recommendations of Gurupadaswamy Committee, the
Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was enacted in 1986. The Act
prohibits employment of children in certain specified hazardous occupations
and processes and regulates the working conditions in others. The list of
hazardous occupations and processes is progressively being expanded on the
recommendation of Child Labour Technical Advisory Committee consti-
tuted under the Act.  </p>
<p>
In consonance with the above approach, a National Policy on Child
Labour was formulated in 1987. The policy seeks to adopt a gradual &
sequential approach with a foCus on rehabilitation of children working in
hazardous occupations and processes in the first instance. The Action Plan
outlined in the policy for tackling this problem is as follows: </p>
<p>
° Legislative action plan for strict enforcement of Child Labour Act
and other labour laws to ensure that children are not employed in
hazardous employments, and that the working conditions of children
working in non-hazardous areas are regulated in accordance with the
provisions of the Child Labour Act. It also entails further identifi-
cation of additional occupations and processes, which are detrimental
to the health and safety of the children.  </p>
<p>
° Focusing on general developmental programmes for benefiting child
labour: As poverty is the root cause of child labour, the action plan
emphasizes the need to cover these children and their families also
under various poverty alleviation and employment generation
schemes of the government. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000275">275</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:275
</h1>
<p>
o  Project-based plan of action envisages starting of projects in areas of
high concentration of child labour. Pursuant to this, in 1988, the
National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme was launched in nine
districts of high child labour endemicity in the country. The scheme
envisages running of special schools for child labour withdrawn from
work. In the special schools, these children are provided
formal/ non-formal education along with vocational training, a
stipend of Rs.150 per month, supplementary nutrition and regular
health check ups so as to prepare them to join regular mainstream
schools. Under the scheme, funds are given to the District Collectors
for running special schools for child labour. Most of these schools are
run by the NGOs in the district. In January 2005, the NCLP scheme
has been expanded to 250 districts in 21 different Indian states,
covering 42 per cent of all districts of the country. </p>
<p>
Thus, the governments have accordingly been taking proactive steps to
tackle this problem through strict enforcement of legislative provisions along
with simultaneous rehabilitative measures. State Governments, which are the
appropriate implementing authorities, have been conducting regular inspec-
tions and raids to detect cases of violations. Since poverty is the root cause of
this problem, and enforcement alone cannot help solve it, the governments
have been laying a lot of emphasis on the rehabilitation of these children and
on improving the economic conditions of their families. </p>
<p>
The Supreme Court too, in a significant judgment, given on December
10,1996, while disposing of a public interest litigation by one lawyer, aimed at
Preventing exploitation of children and safeguarding their economic, social
and humanitarian rights, banned child labour on hazardous jobs and ordered
the setting up of a Child Labour Rehabilitation Welfare Fund. Offending
employer would have to deposit Rs 20,000 as compensation for each child in
the fund. The apex court made it clear that the liability of the employer would
not cease even if he now desired to disengage the child. The court issued
comprehensive directions to central and state governments to see that an adult
member of the child’s family gets a job in lieu of the child’s employment.
However, realizing the strain on the resources of the state, the court did not
ask the government to ensure alternative employment in every case of the
child labourer. Instead, the appropriate government would be required to
deposit Rs 5,000 in the fund for each child employed in a factory or mine or
any other hazardous employment (The Hindustan Times, December 11, 1996).
The apex court also directed the concerned states to conduct a survey on child
labour within six months, for which the court identified nine industries
among primary cases of child labour employers. These industries were: match </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000276">276</pagenum>

Page no:276
</h1>
<p>
industry in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu; diamond polishing industry in Surat,
Gujarat; precious stone polishing industry, Jaipur, Rajasthan; glass industry in
Firozabad, brassware industry in Moradabad and the handmade carpet
industry in Mirzapur—Bhadoi, lock making industry in Aligarh—all in Uttar
Pradesh; slate industry in Markapur, Andhra Pradesh, and slate industry in
Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh. The Supreme Court said that the employment
given or payment made would cease if the child is not sent for education by
the parents. The court warned of penal action in case of non-compliance of
the directive. In the context of non-hazardous jobs, the court directed the
appropriate authority to see that the working hours of the child do not exceed
four to six hours a day and at least two hours are set aside daily for the child's
education. It would also ensure that the entire cost of education was borne by
the employer. </p>

<h1> An Evaluation </h1>
<p>
Despite the hope aroused of some improvement in the lot of the child
workers, the enactment of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation)
Act, 1986, has not goaded either the state governments or the Centre to any
sort of purposive action even on a limited front. Nothing illustrates this
apathy as the fate of the plan of action announced by the Labour Ministry in
August 1987 as an essential component of the National Policy on Child
Labour. Of the ten projects drawn up under the plan to enforce the Act and
provide welfare inputs in such vulnerable areas as the glass industry in
Firozabad, carpet weaving industry in Mirzapur, diamond polishing industry
in Surat and match industry in Sivakasi, only one has been taken up on an
experimental basis. Considering that this lone project in the match industry is
an ongoing one that has since been dovetailed into the action plan, the enunci-
ation of the policy as such has achieved nothing beyond delineating the
responsibility of the states and the Centre. If this is the fate of a pilot scheme
devised to benefit just 30,000 of the 17 million child labour force, the lot of the
rest covered by the Act will be no better than that of the vastly greater
numbers slogging for a pittance in the unorganized sector, who are outside the
purview of the Act. The idea behind formulating the action plan apparently
was to make a beginning with the implementation of the new law and related
provisions of other legislations affecting children in such sectors where the
incidence of child labour is quite endemic. The failure of the projects to take
off inspires no hope about the success of the plan to shift the thrust of the
anti-poverty programmes to those segments of society that contribute the
bulk of child workers. </p>
<p>
To this extent, the enactment of the legislation may have proved
ineffective in affording a measure of protection to children forced to earn a </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000277">277</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:277
</h1>
<p>
 living because of the rising rural impoverishment and the struggle for
existence in urban areas. The legislation was drafted on the sound premise that
since the root cause of poverty cannot be eliminated overnight, the pragmatic
approach was to regulate the practice of child labour. Accordingly, the
employment of children below 14 years has been allowed in selected areas of
the non-hazardous organized sector, with suitable safeguards against their
exploitation and provision for educational and recreational facilities. But a
serious omission in the legislation relates to the enforcement machinery, the
laxity of which has enabled employers to circumvent the provisions of the law
with impunity. Even if punishment for the violation of the new law has been
made stiffer, the cheap, flexible and non-complaining labour provided by
children creates a vested interest in perpetuating the practice. In the absence of
an efficient and rigorous inspection machinery, nothing prevents the
employers from flouting the legal provisions in the full knowledge that the.
child workers themselves will become willing accomplices in covering it up.
Another lacuna in the Act is the failure to define what constitutes hazardous
jobs, while the committee set up to identify permissible jobs has not made
much progress. </p>
<p>
The only way to ensure compliance with the Act is to make punishment
fo violations more stringent and incorporate a provision for surprise checks
and establish a separate vigilance cell. With regard to the workers’ interest, it
should be made mandatory for all employers to take steps for the intellectual,
vocational and educational well- being and upliftment of a child worker,
whether one is employed as a factory hand, a domestic servant or a shop
assistant. </p>
<p>
In this context, the impact of policies which may not be specifically
addressed to children but which try to alleviate poverty and inequality can have
a significant and even decisive impact. Such policies may include agrarian
reforms , employment generation schemes, dissemination of improved
technology among the poor, promotion of the informal sector and creation of
cooperatives and social security programmes. Laws and regulations must be
backed by effective enforcement machinery. This calls for the strengthening of
labour inspection and related services. In order to facilitate the verification of
age, an effective system of birth registration should be maintained by the public
authorities. It should be made mandatory for employers to maintain registers
and documents indicating the names and age of all the employed children. </p>
<p>
That children have to work is sad, but that they should work in condi—
tions dangerous to their health and safety is totally unacceptable. Nor can the
problem of child labour be left untackled until economic conditions and social
structures are fundamentally improved. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000278">278</pagenum>

<p>

Toiling long hours for a pittance, these little breadwinners accept exploi-
tation as a way of life. They only know their sorrows. Silent acceptance is writ
large on their faces. Each day adds more to their growing numbers. Though it
is true that labour helps children in their survival, should the children be made
to pay for the government’s inability to provide alternative employment or
inability to curb poverty? Should they be forced to inhabit an adult world,
bear adult responsibilities, and suffer abysmal exploitation? </p>
<p>
The child workers have no shelter, no food and no education. They run
the risk of contracting various ailments and skin diseases. They are vulnerable
to exploitation by almost anyone—the employer, the parents, the cops, and
even the common man. They become easy targets of drug pushers. They are
even sexually abused. Certain principles of policy are, therefore, to be
followed by the state so that children get opportunities to develop in a healthy
manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and the childhood and
youth are protected against exploitation and moral and material
abandonment. Let us hope, by the orders and the directions of the Supreme
Court in December 1996, and the measures taken by the state, the child of the
21st century will find himself/ herself into the “heaven of freedom”. </p>

Crime Against Women, Page no:280
</h1>
<p>
Few topics today draw the attention of researchers in social sciences,
government, planning groups, social workers and reformers as the problems
of women do. Approaches to the study of women’s problems range from the
study of gerontology to psychiatry and criminology. But one important
problem relating to women which has been greatly ignored and shunned is
the problem of crime against women.</p>

<h1> Women’s Harassment </h1>
<p>
The problem of crime against women is not new. Women in the Indian society
have been victims of humiliation, torture and exploitation for as long as we
have written records of social organization and family life. Today, women are
being gradually recognized as important, powerful and meaningful contributors
to the life of men; but till a few decades back, their condition was pitiable. Ideol-
ogies, institutional practices and the existing norms in society have contributed
much to their harassment. Some of these behavioural practices thrive even
today. In spite of the legislative measures adopted in favour of women in our
society after independence, the spread of education and women’s gradual
economic independence, countless women still continue to be victims of
violence. They are beaten, kidnapped, raped, burnt and murdered. The latest
statistics as released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that
nationwide crimes against women in our country have increased by 7.1 per cent
since 2010 (Times of India, August 27, 2013).</p>
<p>
It is important to clarify here the concept of ‘crime(s) against women’.
The term ‘crime’ does not, in modern times, have any simple or universal </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000281">281</pagenum>

 <p>
definition. However, the new Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (7th edn.,
2005) has defined it as an illegal act or activity that can be punished by law or
that one thinks is immoral or is a big mistake. </p>
<p>
The Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 uses the word ‘offence’ in place of
‘crime’. Section 40 of the IPC defines ‘offence’ as an act made punishable by
the Code. An offence takes place in two ways—either by commission of an act
or by omission of an act. Thus, crimes which are “directed specifically against
“women” and in which “only women are victims” are characterized as ‘crimes
‘against women’ (Singh, 2012). Rape, kidnapping, murder, wife battering,
sexual abuse, eve teasing are all examples of crimes against women. </p>
<p>
    The Police Research Bureau, Delhi has referred to ‘crime against
women’ under two categories: (i) crimes under the Indian Penal Code, and (ii)
crimes under the local and special laws (see Crime in India, National Crime
Records Bureau, Delhi, 1994: 209). The Bureau has identified seven crimes in
the first category and four in the second category of crimes. The seven crimes
under the IPC are: rape, kidnapping and abduction, homicide for dowry,
torture (physical and mental), molestation, eve teasing and importation of
girls upto 21 years of age, while the four crimes under the local and special
laws are: commission of sati, dowry prohibition, immoral traffic, and
indecent representation of women. </p>
 <p>
Who are the women who are victimized? Who are their victimizers or
the perpetrators of violence? Where do the seeds of violence against women
lie? Some scholars who have studied some of these aspects in western society
have used the ‘personality’ approach and the ‘situational’ approach to explain
this problem. But both types of approaches have, however, been criticized on
varied counts. </p>

<h1> Nature, Extent and Characteristics </h1>
<p>
Crime against women may be categorized as:

(i) Criminal violence—rape, abduction, murder, etc.

(ii) Domestic violence—dowry deaths, wife battering, sexual abuse,
maltreatment of widows and/ or elderly women, etc.

(iii) Social violence—forcing the wife/daughter-in—law to go for female
foeticide, eve teasing, refusing to give a share to women in property,
forcing a young widow to commit sati, harassing the daughter-in-law to
bring more dowry, etc. </p>
<p>
If we analyse the data given by various agencies, we find that crimes
against women have been constantly increasing every year. The country
witnessed a 74 per cent increase in crimes against women over the past 15
years between 1998 and 2011, according to a study conducted by an NGO
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000282">282</pagenum>

<p>
based on statistics released by NCRB. The rates of increase in
domestic violence is highest at 140 per cent, followed by kidnapping at 11‘ «‘-
cent, rape by 60 per cent and molestation by 40 per cent. Around 30 per
cases are of cruelty by husband and in-laws (The Sunday Guardian, 6 i.
2013). Similarly, according to a report published by the Lok Sabha Sec '
(N o. 2/ RN/ Ref/ 2013), the total incidents of crime against women 'i
under IPC and SLL), which were 1, 85, 312 in 2007, increased to 2 ,28, 6 i
2011. In 2012, this number was 2, 44, 270, thus recording an increase of u.
than 7 per cent during the year. Crime-wise, the figures are as I
kidnapping and abduction (38, 262), assault on Women with 1ntent to ounI
their modesty (45, 351), insult to the modesty of women (9,173), and c
by husband or his relatives (1,06,527) and imposition of girls from fo a.
countries (59). Of the total crimes under the IPC every year, in the percen”
terms, these are 1. 6, 1. 9, 0. 4, 4. 5 and 0.0, respectively. It is said that in In..'
rape takes place once every 20 minutes, molestation every 25 min .
kidnapping every 40 minutes and dowry death every four hours.   </p>
<p>
In Rajasthan, the proportion of IPC cases committed against women in
total crimes has remained more or less the same as the national average.
According to Rajasthan Police website, in 2012, a total of 1,70,948 cases of
crimes were reported in the state, of which 21,975 (or 12.85%) were against
women.  </p>
<p>
The increase in crimes against women in Delhi is evident from the
increase in the number of cases reported by the Crime Against Women Cell
(CAWC) and by other police stations in Delhi. The number of complaints
rose from 9,853 in 2007 to 11,419 in 2011—an increase of about 16 per cent
(sify news, 19 December 2012). The cases went up not necessarily because of
increased reporting but it only indicates an increased awareness about gender
parity and women’s rights, the confidence of the victims in the new laws for
their protection, and because of institutions such as Mahila Courts, Family
Courts, and NGOs working for women. But we know that all cases are not
reported and recorded for various reasons. The cases of domestic violence like
wife battering and forced incest with the women of the household are never
reported at all. But by referring to the compiled cases, we get some ideas of the
nature and extent of violence against women. We analyse the extent and
characteristics of six types of violence below. </p>

<h1> Rape </h1>
<p>
Until a few years ago, the problem of rape in India was not considered as serious
as in the western countries, particularly in View of its low prevalence rate in
comparison to other countries (i.e., 0.5 per lakh of population in comparison to  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000283">283</pagenum>

Page no:283
</h1>
<p>
United States, 8 in Canada and about 5.5 in the UK). But, now, India is
assumed  to be the ‘rape capital’ of the world and Delhi, with highest number
cases (i.e., 706 out of 24,923 in 2012) as ‘rape capital’ of the country.
every four rapes in Indian cities takes place in Delhi. According to
Crime in India 2012 report, rape is the fastest growing crime in India
increased by 902 per cent between 1971 and 2012. The incidents rose by
3 per cent from 24,206 in 2011 to 24,930 in 2012.  </p>
<p>
According to the report, the rapes were committed by the following:
/ close family member 393 (1.6%), other relatives 1,585 (6.4%), neigh-
bours 8,484 (34%), other known persons 14,008 (56.2%) and unknown
persons 453 (1.8%). Moreover, 1,175 incidents of rape by juveniles were
started. Out of these, 881 were committed by 16—18 year olds, 391 by 12—15
, and 33 by 7—12 year olds. For every one hour, 2.84 cases of rape were
started across the country in which on an average 3.55 persons were
started, suggesting a significant number of gang rapes (EPW, Vol. XLVIII
31, August 3, 2013).  </p>
<p>
   It is not only the poor girls who become rape victims but even the
employees belonging to the middle class are sexually humiliated by their
employers. Women inmates in jails are raped by the superintendents, women
come suspects by the police officers, women patients by hospital personnel,
aid-servants by their masters, and women daily wage-earners by contractors
and middle-men. Even deaf and dumb, lunatic and blind, and women beggars
are not spared. Women who come from the lower-middle class and who are
the main bread winners of their families bear sexual abuse quietly and without
protest. The victims face social stigma and disgrace and suffer serious
built-pangs and personality disorders if they register protest.  </p>
<p>
   The incidence of minors getting raped in the country has also been on
the rise since the past six years. While 5,045 such cases were reported in 2007,
in 2012 the figure touched 8,541, according to data released by NCRB. In the
past ten years, rape cases have shown a significant rise of 336 per cent (Times of
India, 27 August 2013).  </p>
<p>
   In 2008, the number of cases was 5,446; in 2009 it was 5,336; the next
year it touched 5,484; and in 2011 it reached 7,112. There is no disputing the
act that a good number of minors getting raped may even have gone
unreported to the police (The Hindu, 19 June 2013).  </p>

<h1> Kidnapping and Abduction </h1>
<p>
Kidnapping  is taking away or enticing of a minor (female of less than 18 years
and a male of less than 16 years of age) without the consent of the lawful
guardian . Abduction is forcibly, fraudulently or deceitfully taking away of a  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000284">284</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:284
</h1>
<p>
woman with an intent of seducing her to illicit sex or compelling her to many
a person against her will. In kidnapping, the victim’s consent is immaterial but
in abduction, the victim’s voluntary consent condones the crime.   </p>
<p>
The 2012 all-India figures released by NCRB for kidnapping and
abduction show that females were the target of 82. 20 per cent  of all
kidnappings. Among these, 70.90 per cent fell within purposes of marriage
and illicit intercourse. And, of those kidnapped for illicit intercourse, 78.87
per cent fell in the age group of 15—30 years. And, 83.99 per cent of females
kidnapped for marriage purpose were also in the same age group (EPW, Vol.
XLVIII, No. 31, August 3, 2013). The other purposes include adoption,
begging, prostitution, ransom, revenge and unlawful activity.  </p>
<p>
The important characteristics of kidnapping/ abduction as revealed by
my own study are: (1) unmarried girls are more likely to be victims of
abduction than married women; (2) abductors and victims are acquainted
with each other in a large number of cases; (3) the initial contact between the
abductor and his victim frequently occurs in their own homes or neigh-
bourhood than in public places; (4) most often, only one person is involved in
abduction. As such, a threat on the part of the offender and resistance on the
part of the victim is not very common in abduction; (5) the two most
important motives of abduction are sex and marriage. Abduction with an
economic motive constitutes hardly one-tenth of the total abduction; (6)
sexual assaults go with abduction in more than 80 per cent of the cases; and (7)
the absence of parental control and disaffectionate relations in the family are
crucial factors in contacts between the abductor and the victim and girl's
(victim’s) running away from the home with some acquainted person
(labelled later as abductor under pressure) (Ahuja, 1966).   </p>

<h1> Dowry Deaths </h1>
<p>
Dowry deaths either by way of suicide by a harassed wife or murder by the
greedy husband and in-laws have indeed become a cause of great concern for
parents, legislators, police, courts and society as a whole. Not a day passes
when one does not read about a girl being harassed, tortured, killed or driven
to suicide because of dowry, and yet how many of the accused are punished?
Few killers in bride burning cases are arrested, fewer are prosecuted and
fewest finally sentenced.  </p>
<p>
Though the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 has banned the practice of
dowry but in reality all that the law does is to recognize that the problem
exists. It is virtually unheard of for a husband or his family to be sued for
insisting on taking a dowry. If anything, the demands for dowry have
escalated over the years along with dowry deaths. As a modest estimate, the  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000285">285</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:285
</h1>
<p>
half of deaths in India due to non-payment or partial payment of dowry
are placed around 5,000 for one year. The increase in the incidence of
offences is evident from the fact that as against 6,851 cases of dowry
in the country in 2001, 8,233 cases were reported 2012. The number of
cruelty by the husband and in—laws, as stated earlier, was reported to
,527 in 2012. Most dowry deaths occur in the privacy of the husband’s
and  with the collusion of the family members. Courts, therefore, admit
inability to convict any one for lack of evidence. Sometimes, the police
callous in conducting investigations that even the courts question the
ncy and integrity of the police authorities.  </p>
<p>
The important characteristics of dowry deaths as identified by my own
(1966) are:  </p>
<p>
middle-class women suffer a higher rate of victimization than lower-class
or upper-class women; </p>
<p>
about 70 per cent victims belong to 21—24 years age group, that is, they
are mature not only physically but socially and emotionally also;
the problem is more an upper-caste phenomenon than a lower-caste
problem; </p>
<p>
  before an actual murder, several forms of harassment/ humiliation are
  used against the young brides which show the chaotic pattern of social
  behaviour of the members of the victim’s family; </p>
<p>
  the most important sociological factor in the causation of dowry death is
  the offender’s environmental stress or social tensions caused by factors
  endogeneous and exogenous to his family, and the important psycho-
  logical factor is the killer’s authoritarian personality, dominant nature,
  and his personality maladjustment; </p>
<p>
 no correlation exists between the level of education of the girl and her
 murder committed for dowry; and </p>
<p>  the composition of a family plays a crucial role in bride burning cases. </p>

<h1> Wife Battering </h1>
<p>
Violence towards women in the context of marriage becomes more signif—
icant when a husband who is supposed to love and protect his wife beats her.
For a woman, being battered by a man whom she trusted most becomes a
shattering experience. The violence can range from slaps and kicks to
broken bones, torture, and attempted murder and even murder itself.
Some times, the violence may be related to drunkenness but not always. Bred
in Indian culture, a wife rarely thinks in terms of reporting a case of
battering to the police. She suffers humiliation in silence and takes it as her
destiny. Even if she wants to revolt, she cannot do it because of the fear that  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000286">286</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:286
</h1>
<p>
her own parents would refuse to keep her in their house permanently after
the marital break down. </p>
<p>
The important characteristics of wife battering pointed out by my own
study (1966) are: </p>
<p>
1. wives under 25 years of age have higher victimization rates;
2. wives younger to their husbands by more than five years run a greater
risk of being battered by their husbands;
3. low-income women are more victimized, though family income is more
difficult to associate with victimization;
4. family size and family composition have little correlation with wife
beating;
5. assaults by husbands generally do not involve severe injury;
6. the important causes of wife battering are sexual maladjustment,
emotional disturbances, husband’s inflated ego or inferiority complex,
husband’s alcoholism, jealousy, and wife’s passive timidity;
7. exposure to violence of the assaulter in his childhood is an important
factor in wife battering;
8. though illiterate wives are more vulnerable to husband’s beating than
the educated wives, there is no significant relationship between beating
and the educational level of the victims; and
9. though wives with alcoholic husbands have higher rates of victim-
ization, it has been observed that most of the husbands beat their wives
not in a state of drunkenness but while they are sober. </p>

<h1> Acid Attacks </h1>
<p>
Acid attack is a form of violent assault. It is defined as the premeditated act of
throwing acid onto the body of a person “with the intention to disfigure,
maim, torture, or kill”. The most common types of acid used in these attacks
are sulfuric, nitric, or hydrochloric acid. The long-term consequences of these
attacks include blindness and permanent scarring of the face and body, along
with far-reaching social, psychological and economic difficulties.  </p>
<p>
Acid attacks have their root in hatred. While there are many villains in
such incidents, from spurned lovers and angry mistresses to estranged partners
or irate moneylenders, the victim is always a woman.  </p>
<p>
The most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfig-
urement. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which
require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges,
which require in-depth intervention from psychologists and counsellors  at
each stage of physical recovery. These far-reaching effects on their lives impact
their psychological, social and economic viability in communities.  </p>

<p>
       Acid assault survivors also face many mental health issues upon
recovery. These include anxiety, depression, distress and low self—esteem. For
a survivor, an acid attack starts a life littered with obstacles, heartbeaks and
isolation. So tough is it that many choose to shut out a world which they once
dreamt of conquering. Even if these women try and rebuilt their lives, society
and the legal system ensure that nothing comes easy. </p>
 <p>
In addition to the above, many social implications exist for acid survivors,
especially women. For example, such attacks usually leave victims handicapped
in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for
everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. This dependency is
increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find work, due to
impaired vision and range of motion. This negatively impacts their economic
viability, causing hardships on the families/ spouses that care for them.
Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly
become ostracized from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects. </p>
<p>
India is one of the countries where cases of acid throwing or attacks are
most prevalent. It is estimated that there are as many as 1,000 acid attacks a year
in India. But, unfortunately, legal apathy is the most disheartening factor in
women’s struggle against this growing threat. In a cover story “Lost World” by
Nikita Doval, published in The Week (May 20, 2012), currently, there is no
section in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deals specifically with acid attacks in
spite of its rampancy. Acid attack cases are dealt with sections 320, 322, 325 and
326 of the IPC. Of these only section 326 addresses the issue of being attacked
by a corrosive object but categorizes it as ‘grievous hurt’. Though this section
allows punishment upto life imprisonment, most convicts get only a jail term of
three to four years. Compensation, if ordered, is often paltry. </p>
 <p>
  In a bid to curb acid attacks, especially on women, various govern-
ments-both at the central and state levels—have taken several measures from
time to time. The Union Government recently declared that the sale of acid
will be regularized. In another development, the Supreme Court, on 18 July
2013, hearing a PIL filed in 2006 by Delhi-based acid attack victim Laxmi, a
minor then, directed that this crime should be made a non-bailable offence
and enhanced the compensation amount for the victims to Rs 3 lakh, which at
present ranges between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1,50,000 from state to state. </p>
 <p>
 A bench headed by Justice R.M. Lodha gave these directions to states
and union territories to frame rules to regulate sale of acids and other
corrosive substances within three months. The court said that a photo
identity card, containing residential address, issued by authorities concerned,
would be required for purchasing such substances which in any case cannot be
sold a person who is below the age of 18 years. It is hoped that the judgment </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000288">288</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 288
</h1>
<p>
of apex court might go a long way in saving girls from becoming victims of
this heinous crime. </p>
<p>
To conclude, research has prompted many solutions to the increasing
incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh,
whose rates of attacks have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in
many legislative reforms. However, several reports highlighted the need for
an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid
survivors. Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter
regulation of acid sales in order to combat this social issue. The founder of the
Stop Acid Attacks (SAA) campaign, Alok Dixit, however, says that a law
cannot make much of a difference when it comes to incidents related to acid
attacks, which are mostly targeted at women. “It’s a social menace, and we, as
a society, need to find out the root cause behind acid attacks. Moreover, there
needs to be more awareness about this horrific crime and the physical and
psychological consequences faced by the victims.”  </p>

<h1> Honour Killings </h1>
<p>
An honour killing is the murder of a member of a family/ social group by
other members, due to the belief of the perpetrator(s) that the victim has
brought dishonour or shame upon the family/ group by his/ her act. The
apparent dishonour or shame could be caused by refusing to enter into an
arranged marriage or for having a relationship that the family/ group
considers to be inappropriate, having sex outside marriage, becoming the
victim of rape, dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging
in homosexual relations by the victim. In the opinion of Abdullah
Panniyankara (Civil Service India, an e—magazine, August 2013), honour
killing is defined as a death that is awarded to a woman of the family for
marrying against the parent’s wishes, having extramarital and premarital
relationships, marrying within the same gotra or outside one’ s caste or
marrying a cousin from a different caste. </p>
<p>
Honour killing is different from the dowry deaths that are also a very
common practice in India as, in the case of dowry deaths, the perpetrators of
that action claim that they have not been given enough material rewards for
accepting the woman into the family. In that case there is a lot of harassment
from the in-laws and more times than one, it has been noted that the wife
commits suicide rather than being killed by the in-laws, though it has to be
said that she has been mentally killed, if not physically. </p>
<p>
In India, according to a report, more than 1,000 young people have been
done to death every year owing to honour killings linked to forced marriages.
Such killings have been reported from those areas the most where the Khap </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000289">289</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:289
</h1>
<p>
Panchayats are active. These include Jhajjhar, Jind, Fatehabad and Rohtak
districts in Haryana and Meerut, Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar
Pradesh. These groups, though not directly involved in the crime, have
provided the catalytic support to this heinous crime. </p>
<p>
In today’s scenario, if a young couple wishes to marry outside their caste
and community, their endeavour does not receive active support from the
state. The procedural requirements of the Special Marriages Act continue to
pose difficulties for the consenting adults as a minimum waiting period of one
month is required before they can marry. Instances of non-intervention by
the police in providing protection to young couples continue to occur with
impunity. Since ‘honour killings’ are not recognized by law, no concrete data
is available about their magnitude. A recent Law Commission sponsored
study revealed that over a period of four years out of the 560 couples who
were threatened and sought state protection, 121 individuals were killed. No
one from the state has been punished for failing to protect these individuals. </p>
<p>
As is evident, honour killings are directed mostly against women and
girls. The large number of such killings in the country in recent years has
prompted both the government and society to think about this social menace
and take measures to prevent it from happening further. First of all, the
mentality of the people needs to be changed. It means that parents should
always accept their children’s wishes regarding marriage as it is they who have
to lead a life with their life partners and if they are not satisfied they will lead a
horrible married life which might even end in suicide. Secondly, we need to
have stricter laws to tackle these kinds of killings as this is a crime which
cannot be pardoned. And if need be the Hindu Marriage Act can be amended.
The new Chief Justice of India P. Sathasivan also favoured a special law to
L17" honour killings. Speaking to The Hindu, he said: “A special legislation
will certainly be a welcome effort as it will help in generating additional
protection to the victims. Though the prevailing law punishes the act of
homicide, it does not directly punish the members gathering for such
purpose.” The stringent provisions of the proposed Bill coupled with those in
the IPC would effectively combat honour killings and protect the hapless
young couples and their families who are the victims of this social evil (The
Hindu, 3O June 2013). </p>

<h1> Violence Against Widows </h1>
<p>
All widows do not face similar problems. A widow may be one who has no
issue and who has been widowed one or two years after her marriage; or she
may be one who becomes a widow after a period of 5 to 10 years and has one
or two small children to support, or she may be one who is above 50 years of </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000290">290</pagenum>

Page no:290
</h1>
<p>
age. Though all these three categories of widows have to face the problems of
social, economic and emotional adjustment, the first and the third categories
of widows have no liabilities while the second type of widows have to
perform the role of a father for their children. The first two categories of
widows have also to face the problem of biological adjustment. These  two
types are not as welcome in their husband’s family as the third type. In fact,
while the family members try to get rid of the first two types of widows, the
third type of widow becomes a key person in the son’s family as she is made
responsible for caring for her son’s children and cooking food in the absence
of her working daughter-in—law. The self— image and the self-esteem of the
three categories of widows also vary. A widow’s economic dependence is a
severe threat to her self—esteem and her sense of identity. The low status
accorded to them by their in—laws and others in the family roles lowers their
self- esteem. The stigma of widowhood itself negatively affects a woman and
she falls in her own esteem.  </p>
<p>
If we take all types of widows together, we could say that violence
against widows includes physical battering, emotional neglect/ torture, verbal
abuse, sexual abuse, deprivation of legitimate share in property, and abuse of
their children. The important characteristics of violence against widows are
(1) young widows are more humiliated, harassed, exploited or victimized than
the middle-aged widows; (2) ordinarily, widows know little about their
husband’s business, accounts, certificates, insurance policies, and bonds, and
become easy victims of fraudulent schemes fostered by unscrupulous
members of their family (of procreation) who try to acquire their inherited
property or life-insurance benefits; (3) perpetrators of violence are mostly the
members of the husband’s family; (4) of the three most important motives of
victimization—power, property and sex—property is a crucial factor in
victimization in middle-class widows, sex in the lower class widows, and
power in both the middle class and the lower-class widows; (5) though the
authoritarian personality of the mother-in—law and the maladjustment of
siblings-in—law are important etiological factors in the widow’s victimization,
the most important factor is widow’s passive timidity; and (6) age, education,
and class appear to be significantly correlated to the exploitation of the
widows but family composition and family size have little correlation with it. </p>

<h1> Victims of Violence </h1>
<p>
If we take all the cases of violence against women into consideration, we find
that the victims of violence are generally those:  </p>
<p>
  who feel helpless, depressed, have a poor self-image and suffer from
self-devaluation, or those who are ‘emotionally consumed’ by the
perpetrators of violence, or who suffer from ‘altruistic powerlessness’; </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000291">291</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:291
</h1>
<p>
0 who live in stressful family situations, or who live in families which,
in sociological terms, cannot be called ‘normal’ families, that is,
families which are structurally complete (both parents being alive and
living together), economically secure (satisfying basic and subsidiary
needs of members, functionally adequate (have rare quarrels) and
morally conformists;
0 who lack social maturity or social interpersonal skills because of
which they face behavioural problems;
0 whose husbands/in-laws have pathological personalities; and
0 whose husbands are alcoholic. </p>

<h1> Perpetrators of Violence </h1>
<p>
Women are generally abused and attacked by men they know. This is proved
by one study even in England (University of Warwick: Joanna Liddle), which
has pointed out that 61 per cent of women are abused by their own family
members and only 39 per cent by strangers. In the former category, 72 per
cent face violence at the hands of their husbands, by men they know well, and
that too in places they would consider as safe. In India also, the crimes of
marital violence reported to police in different states indicate that the marital
home is not always a safe place for a woman (which also does not mean that a
woman is safer outside her home than in it). Males argue that today a woman
does not adhere to the conventional parameters expected of a wife. Does this
reflect that a woman refusing to conform and asking for some freedom and
some independence needs violence—whether physical, psychological or
emotional—to ensure that conformity? Can we accept this type of ‘patriarchal
consensus’ in this age? </p>
<p>
Seven types of victimizers of women may be identified. They are those:
0 who have depressions, inferiority complex and low self- esteem;
0Who have personality disorders and are psychopaths;
0Who lack resources, skills, and talents and have sociopathic person-
ality;
0 who have possessive, suspicious and dominant nature;
0 who face stressful situations in family life;
0 Who are victims of violence in childhood; and
0 who are frequent users of alcohol. </p>

<h1> Types of Violence </h1>
<p>
If we were to develop a typology of violence against women, we may give six
types of violence:
0 Violence which is money-oriented; </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000292">292</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:292
</h1>
<p>
0 violence which seeks power over the weak;
0 violence which aims at pleasure-seeking;
0 violence which is the result of the perpetrator’s pathology;
0 violence which is the result of stressful family situations; and
0 violence which is victim-precipitated. </p>

<h1> Motivation in Violence </h1>
<p>
Violence against women may be explained on the basis of three factors: (i)
situations which bring about violent behaviour, (ii) characteristics of victims,
and (iii) characteristics of victimizers. Four causes may be identified in
violence against women: (a) victim’ s provocation, (b) intoxication, (c) hostility
towards women, and (d) situational urge. </p>

<h1> Victim ’s Provocation </h1>
<p>
Sometimes the victim of violence by her behaviour, which is often uncon-
scious, creates the situation of her own victimization. The victim either
generates or triggers off the violent behaviour of the offender. Her actions
transform him into an assaulter/ aggressor making him direct his criminal
intentions against her. In my own survey of rape, wife-battering, abduction
ill-treatment of widows, and murders, the focus was on victims, yet some
offenders/assaulters/aggressors were also interviewed. Surprisingly, only a
few seemed to suffer from any feelings of shame or anxiety. A large number
did not suffer from any emotional turmoil or from what psychologists call the
problem of ‘troubled masculinity’. The assaulters in wife battering cases
instead accused their wives of back— biting, talking to person(s) they disliked,
ill-treating their sisters or parents or brothers, neglecting their home, talking
rudely to relatives, having illicit relations with some person, refusing to obey
their in—laws, irritating them with their quarrelsome or nagging nature, or
interfering too much in their affairs. Similarly, in criminal assault (rape) cases,
there were assaulters who described the behaviour of the victim as a direct
invitation to sexual relations or a sign that she would be available if he
persisted. It is significant to determine whether the victim actually intended to
invite such behaviour or not or whether it was merely the victimizer’s own
interpretation/ perception that led him to exploit her. This may be called an
‘act of omission’ (failing to react strongly) on the part of the victim, if not an
‘act of commission’. </p>
<p>
Thus, the ‘passive’ victim contributes to the commission of violent act to
the same extent as the ‘active’ victim. In murder cases too, we came across a
few cases where, according to the assaulters, the homicide situation started
when in arguments and altercations, the victims precipitated such  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000293">293</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:293
</h1>
<p>
Circumstances which motivated them to attack them. In abduction cases too,
some abductors pointed out that their ‘victims’ had willingly agreed to run
away with them and marry but, when they were arrested on the complaint of
parents, the ‘victim’ on being coerced by their parents had accused them of
abduction. On an average, 39 per cent cases were found willing abductions, 24
per cent were forced abductions, 17 per cent accessory abductions (in which
victims neither gave their. consent of going with the ‘accused person’ nor
opposed it but succumbed to the relationship of ‘power’ of the accused over
her), and 20 per cent were stress abductions (in which the victim initially
agreed to leave the house willingly but later on repented when the ‘offender’
raped  her or sold her ornaments or left her in the hotel).  </p>
<p>
 This analysis enables us to classify victims as active, passive and
accidental. At least two kinds of victims create a situation in which the
‘offender’ becomes ‘victim’ of the situation and/ or compulsion and behaves
with the ‘victim’ (female) in such a way that he comes to be labelled as the
‘assaulter’ or ‘victimizer’.  </p>
<h1> Intoxication  </h1>
<p>
Some cases of violence occur when the aggressors are intoxicated and in a
wildly excited and belligerent state of mind, scarcely comprehending the
likely fallout of their actions. For example, in a few cases of rape, the offenders
assaulted the victims when they had taken so much alcohol that they were in a
state of inebriation and emotional excitement. Their normal restraints had
disappeared and their aggressive fantasies were intimately intermingled with
sexual lust which then took the shape of irresponsible actions. Alcohol-related
sex crimes illustrate a reckless disregard of time, space and circumstances.  </p>
<p>
A similar relationship between alcoholism and violence was demon-
strated in a few cases of wife battering and murder. While in my own study, I
had found that wife battering was accompanied by the use of alcohol in 31.7
per cent of the cases Ahuja (1987: 130), Hilberman and Munson (1978: 460—71)
had found it in 93 per cent of the cases, Wolfgang (1978) in 67 per cent cases,
and tinkleberg (1973) in 71 per cent cases.  </p>
<p>
We must admit that when we interrelate violence with alcoholism, we
rely only on the reported use of alcohol rather than on the measurements of
alcohol levels in the blood. In fact, it is the blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
which ought to be the basis of associating battering with the influence of
alcohol. A very high BAC reduces the capability of the subject to cause bodily
harm to others. However, we assume that the level of BAC must be such that
the offender loses control over himself only to the extent that he fails to think
of the consequences of his actions. It is only in this state of mind that he
becomes violent.  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000294">294</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:294
</h1>
<p>
It is not clear whether alcohol induces violent behaviour directly or
whether it acts primarily as a disinhibitor of pre—existing aggressive tendencies
The latter hypothesis is perhaps supported by the notion (Blumer,1973.
73-87) that some perpetrators of violence drink for courage prior to using
violence against persons. But not a single case was reported in my study is
which the assaulter became intoxicated for the specific purpose of assaulting
his victim. However, we cannot provide any proof that the ingest of alcohol
alone elicits violent behaviour. There are many people who take alcohol yet
they hardly ever become violent. The use of alcohol in violence against
women may, therefore, be accepted as a ‘cooperative’ factor rather than the
‘chief’ factor.  </p>

<h1> Hostility towards Women </h1>
<p>
Some of the reported cases of violence against women are of a nature that no
amount of rationalization could convert the aggressors into doing any thing
other than hostile acts of a cruel kind. A few of them had deeply entrenched
feelings of hate and hostility for women that their violent act could be said to
be primarily directed towards the humiliation of the victim. If the mere
situation had been the motivating factor, it is hard to see why a violent at
should have been necessary considering the fact that most of the ‘offenders’
are described as ‘normal’ persons. Perhaps a desire to gloat over the victim’s
humiliation was far stronger. </p>

<h1> Situational Urge </h1>
<p>
In this category, those cases may be included where the crime is committed
neither because of the victim’s behaviour nor because of the offender’s
psychopathological personality but rather because of the chance factors which
create such situations which lead to violence. For example, in a wife-battering
case, it may be that conflict over money matters or on the ill-treatment of
husband’s parent(s) may provoke the husband to assault his wife; or in a rape
case, a man accidentally meets a female acquaintance from his neighbouring
village in a field and begins a conversation, ultimately attempting to have his
way with her; or the male employer taking advantage of his young female
employee finding her alone in his office/ factory in the late hours of the
evening; or a young girl runs away from her father’s house and accepts a lift in
a truck and the truck driver takes advantage of the situation and criminally
assaults her. In all these cases, the ‘offenders’ had not planned the violent acts
but when they found the situation conducive or provocative, they used
violence. Apart from these violent acts, these offenders had not been living a
life of deviant behaviour.  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000295">295</pagenum>
<h1>
Personality Traits, Page no: 295
</h1>
<p>
Some identifying traits of the violence-prone personalities are: extremely
suspicious, passionate, dominant, irrational, immoral, easily emotionally
upset, jealous, possessive and unjust. Traits developed in the early life affect
the aggressive behaviour of a person in adulthood. The aggressor having being
abused as a child, and/ or his exposure to violence during childhood, therefore,
must be examined to delve into his violent behaviour. For example, in the case
of some wife-batterers, their childhood, adolescence and early adulthood
experiences reveal that they learnt to respond to all emotionally distressing
cues with angry and violent behaviour. Unhappy family life amounting to
exposure to physical brutality or severe emotional rejection has been found to
be the rule in the case of most of the aggressors. Some adult aggressors have
faced such situations in their family in their childhood/ adolescence where
they always found their parents screaming and getting at each other, and their
father beating them (children) on the slightest pretext. Often, their fathers
would come home drunk and would charge around the house shouting and
breaking things. Growing up in a violent home inevitably leads to violent
behaviour in individuals, who become aggressive persons in their adult life.
Alfaro (1978), Potts, Henberger and Holland (1979), and Fagon, Stewart and
Ilansen (1981) have also pointed out a similar correlation in their empirical
studies on violent men and their children. Thus, we can say that a good
number of aggressors are victims of child abuse and familial violence, and
exposure to violence as a child strongly influences the probability of one being
generally violent as an adult. </p>

<h1> Theoretical Explanation of Violent Behaviour </h1>
<p>
We have already presented a theoretical explanation of deviant/ violent
behaviour in one of the earlier chapters (Chapter 8 on “Child Abuse”) by
examining the different schools of thought as well as by expounding our own
conceptual framework. The theoretical propositions on violence typically
encountered, whether violence is a normal response of provocation, or
whether it involves the acting out of some psychopathology, or whether it
acts as an instrument to obtaining some end or reward, or whether it is a
response consistent with norms supporting its use, are explained. Our own
conceptual framework is based on a holistic approach and is presented as the
'Social Barrier Theory’ which explains violent behaviour to a large extent. </p>
<p>
The psychiatric or psychopathological school focuses on the aggressor’s
personality characteristics as the chief determinant of criminal violent
behaviour. The socio-psychological school assumes that criminal violence can
best be understood by analysing the external environmental factors that
excercise an  impact on the individual aggressor. This model also examines the  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000296">296</pagenum>
<h1>
PAge no:296
</h1>
<p>
types of everyday interactions (say, stressful situations or family interactional
patterns ..) which are precursors to violence. Theories such as the Frustra-
tion—Aggression Theory, the Perversion Theory, the Self Attitude Theory,
and the Motive Attribution Theory also fall within the purview of
socio—psychological level of analysis. The sociological school provides a macro
level analysis of criminal violence. Besides these, the Theory of Subculture of
Violence, the Learning Theory, the Anomie Theory and the Resource
Theory also fall under the socio—cultural analysis.  </p>
<p>
For developing a new theoretical approach in my empirical study on
violence (crimes) against women, I had two alternatives before me: either to
take ‘intrafamily violence’ and ‘violence exogenous to family’ separately or
combine all types of violence together and develop one theory on ‘violence
against women’. I used the latter approach borrowing certain concepts from
sociologists and criminologists like Hirschi, Schultz etc. </p>
<p>
Violence against a person is necessarily ‘violence by somebody’ and
‘violence against somebody’. As such, violence against women has to be
understood as ‘violence by an individual against an individual’ in contrast to
‘violence by a group against an individual’ or ‘violence by a group against a
group’. In violence by an individual, its origin or form must be determined in
the individual himself and the situation around him. In this approach, not
only individual’s innate behaviour but also his acquired behaviour has to be
taken into account. Our ‘Social Bond Approach’ takes into consideration
both types of behaviour as well as the social structural conditions. </p>
<p>
My contention is that causes of violence against women are found to be
related mainly to five factors: (1) structure of the situation in which violence is
committed, (2) situational facilities which enable the use of violence,(3)
precipitating factor(s) that lead to violence, (4) strains experienced by the
perpetrator of violence, i. e. ., his individual problems, and (5) victim’s
behaviour with the user of violence much before violence is used against her.
A holistic approach to the combination of these factors alone will give us the
correct causes of use of violence against women. </p>
<p>
Specifically, three factors seem to play a major role in prompting a man to
use violence against a woman: (1) perpetrator’s history of abuse as a child(like
unhappy upbringing, physical beating by parents, and emotional rejection);(2)
stressful situations in the family; (3) status frustrations. The first factor points
out that the perpetrator’s violent behaviour is mostly learnt from childhood
and adolescence experiences of emotional distresses. This posits the thesis of the
‘Generational Theory’ that growing up in a violent home increases the
likelihood of an individual becoming violent as an adult. The fact that a very
large number of offenders (78%) in my study on “Crimes Against Women’
were the victims of violence in childhood shows that my data supports this  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000297">297</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:297
</h1>
<p>
Theory. The data also supports the ‘Social Learning Theory’ according to which
indulging in violent (deviant) behaviour as a method of conflict resolution or as
coping mechanism is learnt behaviour. Women’s tolerance of violence is
explained in terms of ‘Learned Helplessness Theory’ and ‘Traditional Social-
ization Theory’. The latter theory refers to woman’s imbibing traditional
values and ‘sex role ideology’ through socialization process that man is superior
to woman and that woman has no right to protest. The former theory
maintains that some events occur in a woman’s life with sufficient regularity
because of which she acquires feelings of depression, helplessness and poor
self-iamge age and comes to believe that she cannot escape abuse. </p>
<p>
      Using a holistic approach, I have proposed a new theoretical model (see
Ahuja, 1996: 193—95) for understanding violence against women or women’s
exploitation. My model focuses on the linkage between a woman’s (victim’s)
personality traits and social environment in which she lives and functions. It
assumes that woman’s exploitation (rape, molestation, beating, harassment for
dowry, kidnapping for leading a life of a prostitute) is the result of interaction
between a woman’s personality (including imbibed feelings of helplessness,
timidity, etc.) and her environment. Each woman lives in a social
environment composed of different persons with varied perceptions and
expectations. A woman’s exploitation will depend on her subjective
perception of her status and role and her will, ability, and efforts to challenge
it(exploitation) with courage. In other words, a woman’s exploitation is
dependent on five things: (i) social background (which refers to her age,
education and training), (ii) level of support (which depends on the support of
her parents, in-laws, peers and others), (iii) expectations of others (including
her husband, parents, in—laws, children, kin, working colleagues, peers, etc.),
(iv) economic base (i. e., whether she belongs to low, middle or upper income
group), and (v) self—image (whether she considers herself timid, bold, helpless,
weak, strong, etc.). My thesis is that the structural conditions of a person
(family crises, role frustrations, unfortunate incidents in life, inappropriate
upbringing) create anxieties and stresses in him because of which he fails to
adjust himself according to his social status, fails to attach himself strongly
with other persons and groups, and fails to commit himself to roles and
obligations to follow a particular course of action. The resultant frustrations
determine his attitude towards others, including the weaker sex or women.
Depending on his personality traits and the resistance potential of the victim,
a man will use violence against a woman. My theory is thus based on a
conjunctive approach which takes into account social factors like stressful
situations endogenous and exogenous to family, personality traits of perpe-
trators of violence and victims, and cultural milieu, like normative pressures
and ambiguities

 <h1>
Self-Image, Self-Esteem and Adjustment of Victims,Page no:298
</h1>
<p>
Self-image and role evaluation are two important aspects of behaviour. Every
individual when playing a particular role according to certain social expecta-
tions is judged by society in accordance with his/ her fulfillment of these
expectations. A woman too, as a victim of violence evaluates herself which is
turn helps/ hinders her in performing the expected roles. Mukesh Ahuja
studied self-image and self- esteem of 193 victims of violence (widows) in 1993
by asking them ten questions each on self-image and self-esteem (see Ahuja,
1996: 113— 35) The questions on self-image included questions on ill-treatment,
humiliation, being ignored, on the feeling of being a burden, feeling rebel-
lious, feeling like running away from home, and on leading a life of one's
choice, etc. He found that about one-third (31%) victims had high self-image,
about two-fifths (41%) had moderate self-image, and about one-fourth (28%)
had low self—image. Making allowance for variables like education, income,
age and working status, he concluded that self- image of victims is affected by
age, nature of violence against her, high education and high income but not by
working status. </p>
<p>
As regards self-esteem, it is generally believed that women victims of
violence/ exploitation develop a negative view of themselves. What Engeland
(1983) has called ‘low self-esteem’, Elwer (1987) has described as
‘self—devaluation’, Kinard (1980)as ‘poor self-concept’ and Hjonth and Ostros
(1982) as ‘poor self-image’. Mukesh Ahuja put ten questions to female victims
(questions of success/ failure in life, high/ low status in family and society,
feeling happy/ unhappy, confidence in self, considering onself strong/ weak
and so forth). He found that a little less than one-third victims (30%) had high
self-esteem, about two-fifths (40%) had moderate self-esteem, and a little less
than one-third (30%) had low self—esteem. It was also found that like
self-image, self-esteem of the victims too depended on emotional support they
got from different sources. Self-image and self-esteem were also found to be
correlated with adjustment in family and society. High self-esteem is positive
personality dimension and reduces dependency syndrome despite the
socio-cultural stigma attached to being sexually assaulted, kidnapped, battered,
and humiliated. It leads to adequate familial adjustment owing to equalitarian
mode of relationship. </p>
<p>
Following Mukesh Ahuja’ s empirical study (1996. 137- 38), the
following important sociological facts may be pointed out about the female
victims of violence and exploitation:  </p>
<p>
1. Structures as source of problems: The problems of females who are
victims of violence arise from the functioning of social structures in  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000299">299</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 299
</h1>
<p>
which they live and work, and the stresses caused by family interac—
tions and support systems. </p>
<p>
Tradition of barriers to assertion: The involvement of victims in social
roles and relationships after being victimized is dependent less on their
own initiative and self-confidence and more on the will of heads of
families (of procreation and orientation) and social pressures, i.e., tradi-
tional culture discourages female victims from taking up assertive social
engagements outside the home. </p>
<p>
Resource deprivation and suffering of self: Resources like higher education
and work with wages increase victim’s self-image and self— esteem which
considerably change her relations with others, and also enable her to face
the strain of transition to life and ‘recovery’ and adjust herself in family
and society. </p>
<p>
Attachment: A large number of victims of violence overcome their
feelings of being isolated and condemned by attaching themselves to
some love object, social service, religious commitments, etc.
Structural suffocation; Factors which prevent victims of violence from
renewing, redeeming, restoring, reviving, and revitalizing their lives lie
more in social structures than in their personalities. </p>
<p>
Negation of revolt: A few young and independent victims have a secret
desire of rebelling and adopting modern methods of adjustment but they
fail to rebel for the fear that their husbands, in-laws and parents might
sever ties with them. They are also scared of being shunned and ostra-
cized by their kin and friends. </p>
<p>
Self-esteem situation: Victims with soppy emotions lead a suppressed life
but victims with courage of conviction, character and consciousness
chart their own course in their (working) life. </p>
<h1> Adjustment Phases </h1>
<p>
The adjustment of victims after being stigmatized (i. e., raped, molested,
Kidnapped, beaten) to new life and their taking up new roles involves several
phases, although there is much intermeshing of these phases. The phases seem
to follow a sequence. Bowlby (in journal of Social Issues, Vol. 44, No. 3, 1988:
45-46) has identified four phases of recovery from shock and a long interval of
adaptation. Following Bowlby (1988) and Ahuja (1996: 139), we may identify
the following four phases in female victims’ adjustment to life after stigmati-
zation: (i) shock and pain, (ii) removing pain, (iii) avoidance and humiliation,
and (iv) adaptation (see Diagram 1). However, all victims do not experience
the same level of shock and pain, the same level of humiliation and avoidance,
and the same problems of finding substitute sources of adjustment. </p>

<h1> The Depersonalization Trauma and Humanistic Approach </h1>
<p>
The two important questions are: what has been done to punish perpetration
of violence against women and what measures should be adopted to prevent
women’s abuse? Besides the enacting of Anti-Dowry Act, 1961, some amend-
ments were made in the existing laws also. One section was inserted in the
Indian Penal Code in 1983 against cruelty and harassment for dowry, while
another section was inserted in 1986 pertaining to causing dowry death.
Amendments were also made in the Evidence Act by inserting a section
which deals with presumption as to abatement of suicide by a married woman
within a period of seven years of marriage and another section which make
the presumption with respect to dowry death once it is shown that the
accused had subjected the deceased woman to cruelty or harassment for or in
connection with any demand for dowry. Despite these strict laws, a large
number of the accused persons are not convicted on charge of murder and
harassment for dowry because of many inbuilt loopholes in the investigative
process, connivance of unscrupulous forces, interference of so—called ‘high
people’, and many more extraneous factors. All these factors dilute the
efficacy and stringency of many provisions in the laws. Unless courts  </p>

<p>
examples in rigidly dealing with release on bail and in interpreting the
evidence produced, it is doubtful that law can reduce this type of crime. </p>
<p>
Can social measures help in reducing violence against women? The
suggestion that improving the general status of women through education,
effective legislative measures, providing training and employment opportu-
nities will reduce violence against women may be valid and logical to some
extent but all the same it is too broad a suggestion. Similarly, it is suggested
that too much prominence should not be given to cases of violence against
women in the mass media. Although, there are ethical and humanitarian
reasons for censoring violence against women in the mass media, we have no
evidence that such a move will necessarily lead to reduction in violence. The
same is true of providing deterrent punishment to perpetrators and social
ostracization by one’s kin, neighbours and friends. These measures may be
desirable for their social effects but we cannot be certain that they will lessen
the exploitation of women to any extent. While there is lack of evidence to
identify which general policies deserve priority, there are nevertheless a
number of measures which could be adopted to contain women’s harassment. </p>
<p>
    First, we take up the issue that is already receiving attention from many
women’s organizations as well as government and private/ public institutions.
this is to meet the needs of protection, support and advice of the victims.
what some, if not all, women need most is the shelter. Women living with
authoritarian in-laws and alcoholic husbands would leave their homes, tempo-
rarily or permanently, if some shelter is available to them. Voluntary
organizations providing such accommodation to women have to publicize
their schemes. It has to be borne in mind that even the existing Homes for
Women—single and/ or married—are not able to meet the required demands.
They are often overcrowded, lack financial support and fail to meet safety
regulations. Providing short-term accommodation to women, particularly
married women who are in distress, or victims of violence like rape,
abduction, attempt to murder, and ultimately helping them find a permanent
place by the women’s organizations will contribute to the alleviation of the
distress suffered by many women. There is an urgent need to evaluate and
compare the different types of short-term accommodation that could be
provided to the victimized women, including widows. </p>
<p>
Second, assistance in finding employment and childcare facilities and
immediate financial support is also the need of the suffering women. Advisory
centres for this purpose could be located centrally but away from the Women
Homes so that they can be well advertised without affecting the safety of the
residents in the Homes. </p>
<p>
Third, establishment of cheaper and less formal courts could also be a
measure to help women who are victims of exploitation. It is not being  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000302">302</pagenum>

<p>
suggested that these courts will handle only the female cases. Their scope has
to be wider. We have at present the system of Family Courts in some states in
our country. But these courts are mainly concerned with preventing the
breakup of the marriages. The scope of these courts could be extended to deal
with all types of domestic and non-domestic problems of women. The estab-
lishment of courts with judges, magistrates and lawyers chosen for their
knowledge and interest in female matters would be an improvement and it
will increase the number of women entering the legal profession. To many
women, the courts and the laws would seem less frightening and more sympa-
thetic and approachable, if they are less dominated by men. Female judges and
lawyers may not differ significantly from their male counterparts in their
attitudes and beliefs and in their interpretation of laws, but female victims
might be happier to appear before other females in the expectation that they
would be more understanding about the problems faced by women.   </p>
<p>
Fourth, strengthening and increasing voluntary organizations which
could take up individual women’s problems with their in-laws or the police or
the courts or the concerned individuals is equally necessary. This is because
the voice of an individual woman carries no weight. In fact, she is accused of
being outspoken if she demands her rights or holds radical views or expresses
her views and releases her frustrations. But if a group of women join together
and raise their voice against woman’s suffering, they can assert their views and
make an impact.   </p>
<p>
Fifth publicity has to be given to those organizations which provide free
legal aid to women so that the needy women could approach them and seek
their help.   </p>
<p>
Last, a change in parents’ attitudes is also necessary in women’s cases.
Why do parents force their daughters—married or widowed—who are
frequently beaten by their husbands or ill-treated by their in-laws to live in
their husbands’ house against their own wishes? When parents come to know
of their daughter’s harassment, why should they not permit their daughters to
live with them for a short time till they are able to fend for themselves? Why
should they remain so concerned about the social stigma and sacrifice their
daughters for the sake of their family?   </p>
<p>
Why should women submit to oppression? Why do they not realize that
they have the potential to look after themselves and their children? Why do
they not understand that their torture creates an emotional trauma for their
children also? Women have to learn to be assertive and accept new roles for
themselves. They have to develop an optimistic and hopeful approach to life. </p>
<p>
We have recently passed more punitive amendments to India’s criminal
law which deals with the cases of crimes against women. For example, the
Delhi gangrape a 22-year-old college girl not only triggered public outrage, it
also ignited a national debate over the reforms that were needed to tackle the  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000303">303</pagenum>

Page no:303
</h1>
<p>
increasing number of rape cases in the country and make it safer for women.
Following the incident, the public discourse on law reform led to the passage
of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 in April 2013, which is a
milestone for anti-rape laws in the country. Not only this, the judiciary also
took a step forward by establishing fast-track courts to ensure speedy trial for
women who have been a victim of any kind of sexual offence. But, in view of
the constant increase in the number of cases, it underlines that mere a law
cannor change society by itself. Violence against women reflects larger societal
and institutional prejudices and making India safer for women involves a
battle to change this culture. </p>

Illiteracy , Page no:304

</h1>
<p>
After independence, India inherited a system of education that was charac-
terized by large-scale and intra-regional imbalances. The system educated a
select few, leaving a wide gap between the educated and the illiterate. The
country literacy rate in 1947 was only 14 per cent and female literacy was
abysmally low at 8 per cent. It is thus commonly believed that with out
substantially eliminating illiteracy, India cannot become a cohesive nation and
give to all its citizens the quality of life they have long yearned for. No
wonder that education in general and literacy in particular have been accorded
a high priority in the country’s development process.  </p>
<p>
How is literacy defined? Who is literate? One who can read and write
some language is ‘literate’. UNESCO has defined a literate person as “one
who can with understanding both read and write a short simple statement on
his every day life”. Following UNESCO, the Census in India in 1991 also
defined ‘literate’ person as one who can read and write “with understanding”
in any Indian language, and not merely read and write. Those who can read
but cannot write are not literate. Formal education in a school is not necessary
for a person to be considered as literate. </p>
<p>
In a resolution on National Policy on Education adopted in 1968, radical
reconstruction of education was proposed so that it could involve: (i) a trans-
formation of the system to relate it more closely to the life of the people, (ii) a
continuous effort to expand educational opportunity, (iii) a sustained effort to
raise the quality of education at all stages, (iv) an emphasis on the development
of science and technology, and (v) cultivation of moral and social values. In
1986 policy, stress was laid on providing equal opportunities of education to

<p>
classes. The 1986 policy was modified in 1992. It envisaged conduct of a
common entrance examination for various professional courses. In 2005, the
government adopted a new policy which mainly focused on higher education. </p>
<p>
There has been significant progress in the field of education since the
1950s. For example, according to the Ministry of Human Resource Devel-
opment, Government of India, there has been a marked increase in the
number of schools in the country after independence. For example, as on 30
september 2010, the numbers different categories of schools were as under:
pre-primary: 68,413; primary: 7,48,547; upper primary: 4,47,600; secondary:
,28,370; and senior secondary: 71,814. Similarly, an impressive increase has
also been registered in the number of literates. As per the provisional totals of
Census 2011, the number of literates aged seven and above is 77,84,54,120
showing a marked improvement in the proportion of literates in the last
decade. Literates in 2011 constituted 74 per cent of the total population aged
seven and above as compared to 65 per cent in 2001. Thus, in absolute terms,
21,77,00, 941 additional persons have become literate during the decade
2001-2011 </p>
<p>
 Literacy rate has also surged forward from 64.83 per cent in 2001 to
74.04 per cent, showing an increase of 9.21 percentage points. The literacy rate
for males and females works out to 82.14 per cent and 65.46 per cent respec-
tively. The increase in literacy rates in males and females during 2001—2011
has been in the order of 6.88 and 11.79 percentage points respectively. The
literacy rate in India in different years was found as. 1951: 18.33 per cent, 1961:
28.30 per cent; 1971. 34.45 per cent, 1981: 43.57 per cent; 1991: 52.21 per cent;
2001: 64.83 per cent; and 2011:74.04 per cent. </p>
<p>
  Together with the quantitative expansion of education facilities, there is
now a greater emphasis on the qualitative aspect as well. Before 1976,
education was exclusively the responsibility of the states, the central
government being concerned only with the coordination and determination
of  standards in technical and higher education. In 1976, through a constitu-
tional amendment, education became the joint responsibility of both the
Centre and the states. Determined efforts were made to achieve the goal of
universal elementary education and eradication of illiteracy in the age group
15-35 by the end of the 20th century. On one hand, community participation
has been planned, and on the other hand, a programme named “Operation
Blackboard” has been implemented to provide the basic amenities in
education in primary schools. The government is also working towards
achieving the goal of ‘Education for All by 2015’. It is a commitment made in
2000 by the international community to provide quality education to all
children, youth and adults. Non-formal education and open learning systems

are being encouraged at all levels. However, in the field of removing illiteracy
in the country, not much progress could be made on account of its huge
population. This is evident from the vast magnitude of illiterate persons still
found in the country. </p>

<h1> Illiteracy in India  </h1>
<p>
According to the provisional totals of 2011 Census, 26 per cent people of India
or a total of 27,29,50,015 persons are illiterate. In 2001, 35 per cent of the total
population was illiterate. Thus, the absolute number of illiterates decreased by
3,11,96,847 during the last decade. The maximum contribution in this
decrease has come from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar. These two states
together account for 37. 43 per cent of the total decrease in illiterates. The
other states showing sizeable decrease in the number of illiterates are West
Bengal (9.44%), Gujarat (7.60%), Maharashtra (7.15%), Karnataka (6.37%),
Tamil Nadu (5.82%), Odisha (5.80%), Andhra Pradesh (4.87%) and Jharkhand
(3.96%). The states where number of illiterates has increased are Rajasthan
(3.18%), Chhattisgarh (0.81%) and Madhya Pradesh (0.80%).  </p>
<p>
The absolute number of male illiterates has decreased by 1,40 74,650
during the decade 2001—2011. In all the states and union territories, except
Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Daman & Diu, the number of
male illiterates has decreased. Even in the states/UTs where the  number of
male illiterates has increased, the increase is not sizeable in absolute terms. The
states which have contribution of more than 5 percentage points in decadal
decrease are Uttar Pradesh (26.22%), Bihar (14.84%), Gujarat (7.39%), West
Bengal (6.80%), Maharashtra and Karnataka (5.86%). Similarly, the absolute
number of female illiterates has gone down by 1,71,22,197 during 2001-2011.
However, the number of female illiterates has increased in Rajasthan
(929,566), Madhya Pradesh (192,536), Chhattisgarh (173,719) and Mizoram
(895). The states which have contributed significantly in decreasing the
number of female illiterates are Uttar Pradesh (21.81%), Bihar (12.63%), West
Bengal (11.61%), Maharashtra (8.21), Gujarat (7.77%), Tamil Nadu (7.31%),
Karnataka (6.79%), Odisha (6.76%) and Andhra Pradesh (5.41%). </p>
<p>
In terms of all-India ranking in literacy rates, according to provisional
totals of 2011 census, Kerala (with 93.91%), as in the past censuses, enjoys the
first rank, followed by Lakshadweep (2.28%), Mizoram (91.58%), Tripura
(87.75%), Goa (87.40%), Daman & Diu (87.07%), Puducherry (86.55%),
Chandigarh (86.43%), NCT of Delhi (86.34%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands
(86.27%), Himachal Pradesh (83.78%), Maharashtra (82.91%) and Sikkim
(82.20%). In terms of the lowest literacy rate, Bihar gets the first rank (with  </p>

<p>
63.82%), followed by Arunachal Pradesh (66.95%), Rajasthan (67.06%),
Jharkhand (67.63%) and Andhra Pradesh (67.66%). </p>
<p>
    If the percentage of illiterates in India is compared with those in other
countries, out country appears to be much behind. According to a study by
the UNICEF in 1998, the highest illiteracy was found in less developed
countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, whereas the lowest in Australia,
Japan and more technological advanced nations of Europe and North
America. For example, the United States and Canada have an overall illiteracy
rate of just 1 per cent. </p>
<p>
  The attainment of goal of ‘Education for All by 2015’ appears to be
difficult also because, as per the World Bank, our public spending on education
is much lower than other countries. In 2010, for instance, India spent only 3.3
per cent of its GDP on education in comparison to 5.6 per cent by USA, 5 per
cent by Russia and 5.9 per cent by France. Not only this, despite increase in the
aggregate expenditure on education, the rate of increase is not necessarily
keeping pace with budgetary expenditure, GDP growth or rate of inflation.
The share of public expenditure on education, which was 4 per cent of
country’s GDP in 1990-91, declined since then. It, however, recovered to over
4 per cent only around the year 2000, but has been since been on a decline and
nowhere near the oft quoted target of 6 per cent. As a proportion of total
revenue expenditure, a decline in the present decade is also observed: at the turn
of the 20th century more than 14 per cent was spent on education, but around
12 percent is spent in the first decade of the present century. </p>
<p>
   The problem of illiteracy among women in our country is worse though
sex differentials have narrowed down significantly over the years. As
mentioned earlier, though the absolute number of female illiterates has gone
down by 1,71,22,197 during 2001—2011 but it is still high in comparison to
other countries. In 2011 census the decadal difference in literacy rates for
males and females stands at 6.88 and 11.79 percentage points respectively. </p>
<p>
 The position of children in terms of illiteracy is equally bad. Despite a
major improvement in overall literacy rates, the number of children who are
not in schools is still high. The literacy rate jumped from 52 per cent in 1991
to 65 per cent in 2001. The absolute number of non-literates dropped for the
first time and gross enrolment in government-run primary schools increased
from over 19 million in the 1950s to 114 million by 2001. In spite of all this, 20
per cent of children aged 6 to 14 are still not in school. </p>

<h1> Causes of Illiteracy </h1>
<p>
The main causes of illiteracy are: (1) high rate of population growth in relation
to low rate of adult population gaining literacy; (2) ineffectiveness of primary </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000308">308</pagenum>

Page no:308
</h1>
<p>
schools in enrolling and retaining students; (3) traditional outlook of low-class
people in using the services of young children either for earning money or
looking after infants in family instead of sending them to schools; (4) high
level of poverty; (5) non-conducive educational policies of the colonial rulers
to the spread of education; and(6 ) low allotment of funds for education  </p>
<p>
In Indian context, the two major causes of illiteracy are paucity of
schools as well as teachers. According to the report of the 8th All india
Education Survey, released by NCERT, the ratio of student to teacher in the
country is 1:32 across primary, upper primary and secondary levels. In
addition, there is also poor sanitation in schools with no toilets and drinking
water facilities. The survey revealed that one-fifth of total schools in rural
areas do not have facility for drinking water and three out of 10 schools do not
have a usable toilet. Even half of them have no playground for children
(Indian Express, January 23, 2013). </p>

<h1> National Policy on Education </h1>
<p>
In India, the first resolution on National Policy on Education was adopted after
independence in 1968. As stated at the outset, radical reconstruction of the
education system in the country was proposed m it. Then, in 198
parliament approved the National Policy on Education (NPE). It sought a
national system of education laying down: (i) a curricular framework to
establish comparability of competence at the end of various stages of education
all over the country, (ii) reinforcing the integrative aspect of society and culture,
and (iii) establishing a value system necessary for an egalitarian, democratic and
secular society. The new policy lists the specific steps in such detail that it has
been described as nothing less than a charter not only for equality of access to
education but also for equalization with regard to the status of the disadvan-
taged sections of society. It lays down that educational transformation,
reduction of disparities, universalization of elementary education, adult
education, and scientific and technological research would be accepted as
national responsibilities for which adequate resources would be provided. </p>
<p>
The concept of the national system of education implies that up to a
given level, all students, irrespective of caste, sex or location, have access to
education of a comparable quality. It envisages a common educational
structure of 10+2+3 for all parts of the country. The break-up of the first 10
years comprises five years of primary education, three years of middle school,
and two years of high school. Regarding elementary education, the NPE
Policy proposed to ensure that all children who attained the age of 11 years
will have had five years of schooling through the non-formal stream. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000309">309</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
Likewise, it proposed that all children will be provided free and compulsory
education up to 14 years of age. </p>
<p>
  Regarding eradicating illiteracy, the NPE, 1986 proposed that in the 15-35
age group, a vast programme of adult and continuing education will be imple-
mented through various channels like: (a) establishment of centres in rural areas
for continuing education, (b) worker’s education through the employers and
concerned agencies of the government, (c) radio, television and films as mass
and group learning media, (d) creation of learners’ groups and organizations, (e)
programmes of distance learning, and (f) organizing assistance in self-learning. In
1992, the NPE, 1986 was modified and a programme of action was formulated,
which stipulated that about 100 million persons would be covered under the
National Programme of Adult Education by 1995. </p>
<p>
  Then, in 2005, a new chapter was added to the educational reforms in
the country when Right to Education (RTE) was passed by the Indian
parliament. </p>

<h1> Right to Education </h1>
<p>
In 1950 India made a constitutional commitment to provide free and
compulsory education to all children up to the age of 14, by adding this
provision in article 45 of the Directive Principles of State Policy. </p>
<p>
  With the Constitution (Eighty-Sixth) Amendment Act on 12th
December 2002, Article 21A was amended in order to introduce Right to
education as a fundamental right. The Right of Children to Free and
compulsory Education Act finally came into force on 1st April 2010. With
the implementation of this Act, it is expected that issues of school drop out,
out-of-school children, quality of education and availability of trained teachers
will be addressed in the short-to medium-term plans.
</p>
<p>
  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
has been designated as the agency to monitor provisions of the Act. The main
provisions of the Act are: </p>
<p>
0  Every child between the ages of six to fourteen years shall have the
right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school,
till completion of

0 No child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses
which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing
elementary education.

0 Where a child above six years of age has not been admitted to any
school or though admitted, could not complete his or her elementary
education, then, he or she shall be admitted in a class appropriate to
his or her age. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000310">310</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 310
</h1>
<p>
0 The appropriate government and local authority shall establish a
school, if it is not established, within the given area in a period of
three years from the commencement of this Act.

0 The Central and the State Governments shall have concurrent
responsibility for providing funds for carrying out the provisions of
this Act.   </p>
<p>
As per the provision of the Act, the Central Government has authorised
the National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) as the
academic authority to lay down the curriculum and evaluation procedure for
elementary education and develop a framework of national curriculum. </p>
<p>
This Act is an essential step towards improving each child’s accessibility
to and . The Act also contains specific provisions for disadvantaged groups
such as child labourers, migrant children, children with special needs, or those
who have a disadvantage owing to social, cultural, economical, geographical,
linguistic, gender or any such factor.  </p>

<h1> Adult Education Programme </h1>
<p>
In the history of adult education, the concept of adult education has
constantly changed and developed under various nomenclatures. The key
concept used upto 1947 was ‘basic education’ which was based on traditional
approach and focused on the programme of night schools. Between 1949 and
1966, the concept used was ‘civic literacy’ which was based on life-oriented
approach and focused on social education. Between 1967 and 1977, ‘functional
literacy’ concept based on work-oriented approach came to be emphasized in
adult education which focused on functional literacy programme, farmer’s
education and Shramik Vidyapeeths. From 1978 onwards, ‘developmental
literacy’ concept based on social change approach came to be used more
which focused on total literacy campaigns. </p>
<p>
The basic literacy concept evolved with the expansion of night schools
which received grants-in-aid from 1929. The course in this scheme was spread
over a period of two years and included simple lessons in 3 Rs, stories of
historical importance, and elementary lessons in health, hygiene and first-aid.
The instruction was imparted for 2—3 hOurs in the evening. During 1938—39, a
series of Provincial Mass Literacy Campaigns were organized by different
provincial governments. It was estimated that during 1938—42, about 1.38
crore persons became literate.  </p>
<p>
The concept of civic literacy was conceived in 1949 and modified in 1952
when it was integrated with Community Development Programme. It was
implemented all over India during the first two five-year plans. It was
estimated that nearly 35 lakh illiterates became literate during the First
Five-Year Plan and about 40 lakh during the Second Plan.  </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000311">311</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:311
</h1>
<p>
The concept of functional literacy emerged during the 1960s. Defined as
“literacy integrated with the occupation of the learner and directly related to
development”, functional literacy was translated into action in 1968. Initially
it was introduced in three districts but it expanded during next ten years and
covered 144 districts out of 397 by 1977. During the Fourth Plan, nearly 30
lakh farmers joined the functional literacy classes.  </p>
<p>
 By early 1970s, the concept of development literacy came to be evolved.
Literacy was described not just the process of learning the skills of reading,
writing and arithmetic but a contribution to the liberation of man and to his
full development. In 1978, the government formulated the National Adult
Education Programme (NAEP). The 1980s also witnessed the expansion of
University Adult Education in India when the University Grants
Commission (UGC) provided grants to 93 universities.   </p>

<h1> National Adult Education Programme </h1>
<p>
The NAEP was launched on October 2, 1978 with the aim of providing
education and promoting literacy among all illiterate persons, particularly in
the age group of 15—35 years. The programme is a joint and collaborative
effort of the central government, state governments, union territory adminis-
trations, voluntary agencies, universities, colleges and youth centres. The
education under the NAE programme is a package which envisages: (i)
imparting literacy skills to the target illiterate population, (ii) their functional
development, and (iii) creation of awareness among them regarding laws and
policies of the government for the efficient implementation of the strategy of
redistributive justice. Special emphasis is being placed on the education of
women, SCs/STs and other weaker sections of society, who comprise the
bulk of illiterate population in India.   </p>

<h1> Rural Functional Literacy Programme </h1>
<p>
The RFLP IS a sub-programme of the NAEP which is fully funded by the
central government and implemented by the states and union territories. The
broad objectives of this programme are: (i) to develop abilities in the learners
to read and write, and (ii) to create awareness among the learners about their
rights and duties and the benefits they can draw from various schemes of
socio economic development being implemented by the government.   </p>
<p>
 The RFLP was launched in May 1986 by involving the NSS and other
student volunteers in colleges and universities on the principle of “Each One
Teach One”. Starting on a modest scale of 2 lakh volunteers, it went up to 4.50
lakh in 1990 covering over 4.20 lakh learners. The programme has been
designed keeping in view the needs and languages of the learners. The   </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000312">312</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:312
</h1>
<p>
government has selected 40 districts to improve the quality of adult education .
It is only after evaluation of the impact that the programme will be taken up
in a big way to spread literacy in the minimum possible time. </p>
<p>
The process of the Mass Programme of Functional Literacy involves a
number of stages. These stages are: selecting master trainers who are to train
the student volunteers; selecting, motivating and mobilizing the student
volunteers who are genuinely and sincerely committed to literacy work;
identifying illiterate persons in the age group of 15-35 who may be staying in
the neighbourhood of an educational institution; forging a link between the
student volunteers and the illiterate persons and assigning an area of operation
for each volunteer; monitoring of the programme of the student volunteers
by senior teachers/headmasters of schools; coordination with various devel-
opment departments/ agencies by way of visits of functionaries to the place
where the volunteer is imparting literacy, telling the learners about the advan-
tages of being literate, making available charts, posters and other materials to
the learners and identifying genuine difficulties of the learners; and providing
post-literacy activities for the neo—literates through libraries and reading
rooms. Coverage and support by the media and evaluation of the overall
impact of the programme through University Departments of Adult and
Continuing Education is of crucial importance. </p>

<h1> Directorate of Adult Education </h1>
<p>
The Directorate of Adult Education, a subordinate office of the Department
of Elementary Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Devel-
opment, has been functioning as the National Resource Centre for Adult
Education and Literacy Programmes in the country. It is the functional arm
of the NLM, which is responsible for monitoring, and evaluation of various
schemes launched under the aegis of the Mission. The Directorate is also
entrusted with the task of developing model teaching learning materials for
the learners and neo—literates and harnessing all kinds of media facilities for
furtherance of the objectives of the NLM. It provides professional, academic
and technical guidance for the effective functioning of the Jan Shikshan
Sansthans (previously known as Shramik Vidyapeeths). </p>
<p>
The main activities of various units of the Directorate are:

0 Provision of academic and technical resource support for implemen—
tation of various programmes of the NLM.
0 Development of teaching material.
0 Organization of training and orientation programmes keeping in
view the needs of ongoing programmes in the field.
0 Monitoring of the progress and status of literacy campaigns. </p>

<h1> National Literacy Mission </h1>
<p>
National Literacy Mission (NLM) was launched on May 5, 1988 as a
Technology Mission to impart functional literacy to non-literates in the
country in the age group of 15—35 years in a time bound manner. This age
group has been the focus of attention because they are in the productive and
reproductive period of life. The National Education Policy, 1986, as modified in
1992, also has recognized National Literacy Mission (NLM) as one of the three
instruments to eradicate illiteracy from the country, the other two being
Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) and Non-Formal Education. </p>
<p>
The success of the Ernakulam literacy campaign in 1990 provided the
much-needed clue to the manner in which the Mission can move to achieve its
desired objectives. The campaign mode, which was adopted as the dominant
strategy under the Mission, has proved to be the most appropriate in Indian
conditions. Through these campaigns not only the 3 Rs are imparted to the
beneficiaries, they are also made aware of their rights and responsibilities
towards their family, society and the country so that they can play appro-
priate roles in the development of the country as a whole. Thus, the
campaigns have been launched not only for spreading literacy but also for
family welfare, immunization, mother and child health care, conservation of
environment, communal harmony, cohesion, national integration etc. </p>
<p>
The Mission’s objective was to impart functional literacy to 80 million
illiterate persons in 15—35 age group—3O million by 1990 and additional 50
million by 1995. However, later on, the goal of the Mission became to attain a
sustainable threshold literacy rate of 75 per cent by 2007.</p>
<p>
The Mission also takes into its fold children in the age group of 9— 14, in
areas not covered by non-formal Education programmes to reach the benefits
of literacy to out-of-school children as well. The major thrust of these
programmes is on the promotion of literacy among women, SCs/STs and
other backward classes. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000314">314</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:314
</h1>
<p>
The NLM eventually aims at ensuring that the Total Literacy Campaign
(TLC) and their sequel, the Post-Literacy Programme (PLP), successfully
move on to Continuing Education (CE), which provides a life-long learning
and is responsible for the creation of a learning society. </p>
<p>
According to a press note released by the Ministry of Human Resource
Development, Government of India on September 1, 2008, the number of
persons made literate was 124.64 million. While 60 per cent of the learners
were female, 23 per cent belonged to SCs and 12 per cent belonged to STs. A
total of 597 districts were covered under literacy programmes. Similarly,221
Jan Shikshan Sansthans and 26 State Resource Centres were set up. </p>

<h1> Total Literacy Campaign </h1>
<p>
As stated above, Total Literacy Campaign (TLC) has been the principal
strategy of the National Literacy Mission (NLM) for eradication of illiteracy
after the success of the campaign mode in Ernakulam district of Kerala. </p>
<p>
The TLC has certain positive characteristics like being area-specific,
time-bound, participative, delivery through voluntarism, cost effective and
outcome oriented. Though the campaign emphasizes the achievement of
predetermined levels of literacy and numeracy, there are other activities
linked up with TLCs, such as campaigns for universal enrolment and
retention in schools, immunization, conservation of environment, the small
family norm, women’s empowerment, etc.  </p>
<p>
The TLC has an assumed duration of 12 to 18 months of which half is
devoted to preparation and half to actual teaching/ learning activity. In excep-
tionally difficult areas, the duration is suitably extended. Two activities,
namely, environment building as well as monitoring and internal evaluation
are continued throughout the campaign.  </p>
<p>
The initial activity of environment building is closely followed by a
door-to-door survey to identify potential learners and volunteer instructors.
Suitable primers (in three parts) are developed through the State Resource
Centres for adult education in accordance with the new pedagogic technique
of ‘Improved Pace and Content of Learning’.  </p>
<p>
The three-legged management structure of TLC consists of popular
committees from district to village levels, the ZSS supported by the
subject-specific sub—committees, and the officials of the district and block level
administration. </p>
<p>
Literacy campaigns are implemented by the Zila Saksharata Samitis,
usually headed by district collectors. Both the central and state governments
participate in funding in the ratio of 2:1 for normal districts while the ratio of
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000315">315</pagenum>
<h1>
Page  no:315
</h1>
<p>
Central and state share for districts under tribal sub-plan areas is 4:1. Presently,
learner cost for a TLC is between Rs 90 to 180. </p>

<h1> Post- Literacy Programme </h1>
<p>
the conclusion of Total Literacy Campaign (TLC), Post-Literacy
programme is implemented by the Zila Saksharata Samiti (ZSS) for the period
one year. </p>
<p>
  One of the major objectives of a Post-Literacy Programme is to enable
the neo-literates to learn the application of literacy skills as a problem-solving
ol, so that learning becomes relevant to living and working. In the limited
me available during TLC, it is not possible to dwell adequately on the
functionality and awareness components of the programme. Therefore, in
post- literacy phase, these objectives take centre stage. </p>
<p>
 One of the first tasks in a Post-Literacy Programme is what is known as
nopping up’ operation. Those learners, who dropped out or could not
achieve the NLM levels of literacy in the TLC phase, are enabled to achieve
them through remediation or mopping up operation. </p>
<p>
To ensure that there is no time lag between the conclusion of the basic
literacy phase and the start of Post-Literacy Programme, which could result in
a regression of neo—literates, NLM has laid a great deal of emphasis on the
planning and launching of Post-Literacy Programme well in time. </p>
<p>
Post-literacy specifically aims at remediation, retention and consoli-
dation of literacy skills in the first phase through guided learning. In the
second phase, learners are provided with a variety of supplementary reading
material and library services to help them continue learning through
self directed processes. </p>
<p>
The NLM has emphasized the integration of skill development
programme with Post-Literacy Programme to enable the neo-literates acquire
skills for their economic self— reliance. </p>
<p>
The Post-Literacy Programme is to be regarded as the preparatory stage
for Continuing Education Programme in the district. The duration of
post-Literacy Programme, which was initially for two years, has now been
restricted to one year. The present per learner cost for Post-Literacy
Programme has been enhanced to Rs 90-130 per annum. </p>

<h1> Continuing Education Programme </h1>
<p>
The Government of India had approved a new scheme of Continuing
Education for Neo—Literates in December 1995. It provided a learning
continuum to the efforts of the Total Literacy and Post-Literacy Programmes.
The scheme was revised in November 1999, which retained the basic structure
of CECs and further expanded its scope and content. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000316">316</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:316
</h1>
<p>
    Under the scheme the main thrust is given to setting up of Continuing
Education Centre (CBC) which will function as a focal point for providing
learning opportunities such as library, reading room, learning centre, training
centre, information centre, charcha mandal, development centre, cultural
centre, sports centre and other individual interest promotion programme
centre. One CEC is set up for a population of 2,000 to 2,500. For a group of
about 10—15 CECs, there is a nodal CEC, which monitors and oversees the
activities of those cluster of CECs. Besides the provisions of setting up of
CECs, the scheme of continuing education also provides the opportunities to
undertake diverse activities involving alternative and innovative approaches
to cater to the needs of the learners. Taking into account local conditions and
the resources available, various target specific activities such as Equivalency
Programmes (EPs), Quality of Life Improvement Programmes (QLIPs),
Income Generating Programmes (AGPs) and Individual Interest Promotion
Programmes (IIPPs) could be organized for specific groups of beneficiaries.  </p>
<p>
The programmes of continuing education are being implemented under
the aegis of ZSSs, which, along with district, block and gram panchayat level
committees, are responsible to oversee the programme in the entire district.  </p>
<p>
Each CEC will be annually provided assistance of Rs 25,000 as recurring
and non-recurring grant, and nodal CEC Rs 45,000 as recurring and
non-recurring grant with an additional provision of house rent for few
selected centres where no government or community building is available to
run the centre. In the revised scheme a provision of Sahayak Prerak has been
made who will be primarily responsible for conducting literacy classes during
continuing education programme.  </p>
<p>
The scheme envisages 100 per cent assistance to the states for the first
three years of the implementation. The state governments are required to
share 50 per cent of the expenditure during the fourth and fifth year of the
project, and thereafter take over the total responsibility for the programme  </p>
<p>
The State Literacy Mission Authorities (SLMAs) have been authorized
to sanction the projects for CE related to their states. Where SLMA has not
been created the state government is required to examine and recommend
their CE projects to the NLMA, which then discusses and sanctions the
projects in its Project Approval Committee (PAC). Grants are placed at the
disposal of SLMA/ state governments on basis of the project for onward trans-
mission to the respective ZSS or the implementing agency.   </p>

<h1> NLM’s Contribution to Female Literacy </h1>
<p>
The provision of educational opportunities for women has been an important
part of the national endeavour in the field of education since India's  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000317">317</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
 Independence. Though these endeavours did yield significant results, gender
disparity persists with uncompromising tenacity, more so in the rural areas
and among the disadvantaged communities. It is with this concern that the
Government of India launched the National Literacy Mission in 1988 for the
eradication of adult illiteracy. Total literacy campaigns launched since 1988
under the aegis of the NLM have adopted a strategy that lays considerable
emphasis on making efforts to:  </p>
<p>
0 Create an environment where women demand knowledge and infor-
 mation, empowering themselves to change their lives.

0 Inculcate in women the confidence that change is possible, if women
  Work collectively.

0 Spread the message that education of women is a pre-condition for
 fighting against their oppression.

0 Highlight the plight of the girl child and stress the need for UEE as a
  way of addressing the issue. </p>
<p>
 One of the most striking features of India’ s campaign against illiteracy
has been its focus upon, and involvement of, women. From the information
available around 60 per cent of the learners are women and considerable
numbers of the volunteers are also women and young girls. The gender gap is
slowly but surely closing. Nonetheless, India’ s achievements today cannot
mask the daunting obstacles still to be overcome. </p>
<p>
Some of the significant ways in which the literacy campaigns have
contributed to the promotion of female literacy and women’s empowerment
are as follows: (i) social awareness, (ii) school enrolment, (iii) self- confidence
and personality development, (iv) gender equity and women’s empowerment,
(v) status in the family, (vi) educational equality, (vii) women as entrepreneurs,
(viii) household savings and access to credit, and (ix) health and hygiene. </p>

<h1> Evaluation of NLM </h1>
<p>
In 1993,the Government of India set up an Expert Group chaired by
Professor Arun Ghosh, which undertook the evaluation of Total Literacy
Campaign (TLC) in India. The group submitted its report in 1994. Its major
recommendations are as follows: </p>
<p>
0 to stop formal declaration of total literacy achievements by states/
districts

0 target of 80 per cent success unrealistic and 55 per cent to 60 per cent
success to be considered as good progress;

0 to enhance involvement of PRIs and the elected representatives of
gram panchayats and panchayat samities in literacy programmes; </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000318">318</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:318
</h1>
<p>
0 to decentralize the procedure for sanction of project;
0 to tighten evaluation procedures and
0 to cover the age group of 9- 14 also under TLCs, where non- formal
  education is not in operation. </p>
<p>
The report also certain strengths and weaknesses of the programme
which are given below: </p>

<h1> Strengths </h1>
<p>
0 It is more of a movement than a programme.
0 There has been an overwhelming impact on women.
0 TLC has led to a positive impact on caste and communal relations.
0 The literacy movement has generated a demand for Primary
  education.
0 Literacy campaigns have activated concern for developing a just and
  humane society.
0 They have led to sensitization of the bureaucracy.
0 The launching of TLC has placed literacy high on the national
  agenda. </p>

<h1> Weaknesses </h1>
<p>
0 The quality of teaching has suffered in some places where there has
  been excessive preoccupation with literacy skills alone.
0 Fragile literacy skills need to be consolidated through more effective
  post literacy measures.
0 Some campaigns have been launched without adequate preparations
0 Progress is patchy and doubtful in some states.
0 Poor progress in urban areas. </p>

<h1> Eradicating Illiteracy in India </h1>
<p>
Eradication of illiteracy has been one of major national concerns of the
Government of India since independence. The Union Human Resources
Minister explained the programme of major acceleration in education ,while
attending the Education For All (EPA) summit of nine highly populated
countries held in Copenhagen in the second week of March 1995. The govern-
ment’s future plans were described as: (1) By the turn of the century, even
child between the age of 6 and 14 years will have the opportunity to attend
school and get educated. (2) There will be a sharp increase in the num-ber of
primary schools and of teachers. (3) In rural areas, schools will be within the
reach of every village. (4) Besides the universalization of primary education
there will be vocationalization of secondary education and rationalization of
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000319">319</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:319
</h1>
<p>
higher education. This will make education employment-oriented right from
the secondary stage. (5) To deal with the dropouts, the government has a plan
if expanding the open school system. (6) In the field of adult literacy
programme, the government plans to cover about 100 million people by 1997.
Earlier, the government sources had stated that the target group for universal
education in the age group of 6—14 years is 152 million (constituting about 18
per cent of the total population in 1991), while the target group for adult
literacy programme in the age group of 15—35 years is 254 million (consti-
tuting about 30% of the population in 1991) (The Hindustan Times, June 6,
1995). (7) There will be significant increase in the amount of money to be
spent on education, as by the turn of the century, the government will be
spending 6 per cent of the GNP on education against the present 3.7 per cent
of GNP. This amounts to increase from Rs 28,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore
annually). (8) NGOs and private initiative will be encouraged in the spread of
education (The Hindustan Times, March 19, 1995). </p>
<p>
As stated earlier, eradication of illiteracy has been one of the major
concerns of the governments both at central and state levels. In recent years,
various initiatives have been taken by governments to eradicate illiteracy.
Some of these are: </p>

<h1> Elementary Education </h1>
<p>
Elementary  education in India starts from the age of six. The government has
made elementary education compulsory and free. The central and state
governments have been expanding the provision of formal and non-formal
primary education to realize the goal of Universalization of Elementary
Education (UEE). The following schemes have been launched under this
programme: </p>
<p>
0 The Schemes for Providing Quality Education in Madrassas
  (SPQEM)
0 Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS)/ Alternative & Innovative
  Education (AIE)
0 Education for Women’s Equality
0 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV)  </p>

<h1> Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan </h1>
<p>
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is a Government of India flagship programme
for achievement of Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE). The
programme seeks to open new schools in those habitations Which do not have
schooling facilities and strengthen existing school infrastructure through  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000320">320</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 320
</h1>
<p>
provision of additional class rooms, toilets, drinking water, maintenance grant
and school improvement grants. SSA has a special focus on girl’s education
and children with special needs. SSA also seeks to provide computer education
to bridge the digital divide. </p>

<h1> Mid-Day Meal Scheme </h1>
<p>
Aiming at enhancing enrollment, retention and attendance and simulta-
neously improving nutritional levels among children, the Mid-Day Meal
(MDM) is the world’s largest school feeding programme, reaching out to
about 12 crore children in over 9.50 lakh schools/EGS centres across the
country. </p>

<h1> Secondary Education </h1>
<p>
Secondary education begins from Class IX, leading to higher secondary
education in classes 11 and 12. This crucial stage develops competency in
children, which prepares them for higher education and for the professional life.  </p>
<p>
Following the constitutional mandate to Universalization of
Elementary Education (UEE) and success of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, it has
become essential to move towards universalization of secondary education
Schemes under this are: </p>
<p>
0 Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA)
0 Girls Hostel Scheme
0 Model School Scheme
0 Information And Communication Technology In Schools
0 National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship

<h1> Higher Education </h1>
<p>
Higher Education starts after Class XII. Major policy decisions relating to
higher education in the country are taken by the Central Government. It
provides grants to University Grant Commission (UGC) and establishes
central universities in the country. The Central Government is also respon-
sible for declaration of educational institutions as ‘Deemed to be University
on the recommendation of the UGC. And, State Governments are respon-
sible for establishment of State Universities and colleges.  </p>

Literacy among adults has been recognized as a crucial input for nation
building. The National Literacy Mission (NLM) was set up in May 1998 to  </p>

<h1> Efforts by Voluntary Organizations  </h1>
<p>
The government alone cannot solve the vast problem of illiteracy in the
country. It is not possible to achieve the objective of total eradication of illit-
eracy entirely through governmental efforts. The government can
undoubtedly take cognizance of the situation, identify the agencies, institu-
tions and individuals, act as a catalytic agent to provide human material and
financial resources, but it cannot promote literacy by itself. The efforts of the
government—both central and state—will, therefore, have to be supplemented
and strengthened by voluntary organizations and individuals who have a
positive perception and commitment. In other words, we may also have to
move from the concept of exclusive responsibility of the government for
education to shared responsibility between the government and the
community. </p>
<p>
  To conclude, Article 45 of our Constitution refers to “endeavour to
provide  free and compulsory education for all children until they reach 14
years of age”. While many state governments claim to have enacted
compulsory education laws but, in practice, no state has implemented such a
law, that is, requiring local authorities to compel school attendance. In fact,
instead of talking of 'compulsory' education, the decision-makers now talk of
'univesal’ education. Even, the New Education Policy of 1986 gave concrete
expression to the shift away from the goal of compulsory schooling.
Elementary education is now ‘universalized’ and not ‘compelled’. The educa-
tional restructuring and the ‘new’ policy now focus on ‘incentives’ like free
school meals, free uniforms, free books and skill-oriented teaching. Of the
estimated 105 crore population in the 7 and above age group, only about 77
crore is found to be literate as per the provisional totals of 2011 Census. Of
every 10 children who enter the first grade, only four complete four years of
schooling. By shrugging off its duty to educate children, our society and our
government are in effect denying the experience of childhood, that is, of play,
experimentation, and self-discovery to millions of children. Retreat from the
formal commitment to mandatory full-time schooling has unmistakably been </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000322">322</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:322
</h1>
<p>
a retrogressive step in economic development as well as in reducing the
problem of child labour in the country. </p>
<p>
It may therefore be inferred that the task of making some 30 crore
people literate indeed needs perseverance and require ingenious efforts and a
high degree of motivation on the part of both the learners and the instructors.
Such a serious problem of illiteracy calls for drastic measures rather than the
half-hearted approaches we have so sedulously pursued all these years without
any tangible results whatsoever. Mass illiteracy and child education have to be
tackled on a war footing because of the sheer magnitude of the problem. After
all, education is the backbone of a nation.  </p>

Urbanization, Page no:323
</h1>
<p>
Along with the growth of population in the last few decades, there has been a
shift in the population from rural to urban areas. The increasing urbanization
has led to problems like crime and juvenile delinquency, alcoholism and drug
abuse, housing shortage, overcrowding and slums, unemployment and
poverty, pollution and noise, and communication and traffic control among
others. But if cities are places of tensions and strain, they are also the centres of
civilization and culture. They are active, innovative and alive. They provide
opportunities to achieve one’s aspirations. If the future of our country is
linked with the development of rural areas, it is equally linked with the
growth of cities and metropolitan areas. But before analysing these problems,
let us understand the basic concepts. </p>

<h1> Concepts of Urban, Urbanization and Urbanism </h1>
<p>
Urban
What is an ‘urban area’ or a city or a town? This term is used in two
sences- demographically and sociologically. In the former sense, emphasis is
given to the size of population, density of population and nature of work of
the majority of the adult males; while in the latter sense, the focus is on heter-
ogeneity, impersonality, interdependence, and the quality of life. The German
sociologist, Tonnies (1957) differentiated between rural and urban commu-
nities in terms of social relationships and values. The rural gemeinschaft
community is one in which social bonds are based on close personal ties of </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000324">324</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:324
</h1>
<p>
kinship and friendship, and the emphasis is on tradition, consensus and infor-
mality, while the urban gesellschaft society is one in which impersonal and
secondary relationships predominate and the interaction of people is formal,
contractual and dependent on the special function or service they perform.
The emphasis on gesellschaft society is on utilitarian goals and competitive
nature of social relationships. Other sociologists like Max Weber (1961:381)
and George Simmel (1950) have stressed on dense living conditions, rapidity
of change and impersonal interaction in urban settings. Louis Wirth (1938:8)
has said that for sociological purposes a city may be defined as “a relatively
large, dense and permanent settlement of socially heterogeneous individuals".
Scholars like Ruth Glass (1956) have defined city in terms of factors like: size
of population, density of population, main economic system, type of adminis-
tration, and some social characteristics.  </p>
<p>
In India, the census definition of ‘town’ remained more or less the same
for the period 1901—51, but in 1961, a new definition was adopted. Up to
1951, ‘town’ included (1) collection of houses permanently inhabited by not
less than 5,000 persons, (2) every municipality/ corporation/ notified area of
whatever size, and (3) all civil lines not included within the municipal units.
Thus, the primary focus in the definition of town was more on the adminis-
trative set-up rather than the size of the population. In 1961, certain tests were
applied for defining a place as ‘town’. These were: (a) a minimum population
of 5,000, (b) a density of not less than 1,000 persons per square mile, (c)
three-fourths of its working population should be engaged in non-agricultural
activities, and (d) the place should have a few characteristics and civic
amenities like transport and communication, banks, schools, markets, recre-
ation centres, hospitals, electricity, and newspapers, etc. As a result of this
change in the definition, 812 areas (with 44 lakh people) declared as towns in
the 1951 census were not so considered in the 1961 census. The 1961 basis was
adopted in the 1971, 1981 and 1991 censuses too for defining towns. From
2001 Census, the towns and cities are classified as ‘Tier I’ with people 1,00,000
and above, ‘Tier II’ with 50,000 to 99,999, ‘Tier III’ with 20,000 to 49,999,
‘Tier IV’ with 10,000 to 19,999, ‘Tier V’ with 5,000 to 9,999 and ‘Tier VI’ with
less than 5,000.  </p>
<p>
Sociologists do not attach much importance to the size of population in
the definition of city because the minimum population standards vary greatly.
The reason being every country has a criterion of minimum population for a
place to be designated as ‘urban’. As such, they give more importance to
characteristics other than the population size. Theodorson (1969: 451) has  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000325">325</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:325
</h1>
<p>
defined ‘urban community’ as “a community with a high population density,
predominance of non-agricultural occupations, a high degree of special-
ization resulting in a complex division of labour, and a formalized system of
local government. It is also characterized by a prevalence of impersonal
secondary relations and dependence on formal social controls”. According to
Robert Redfield (American journal of Sociology, January 1942), ‘urban society’
is  characterized by a large heterogeneous population, close contact with other
societies (through trade, communication, etc.), a complex division of labour, a
prevalence of secular over sacred concerns, and the desire to organize
behaviour rationally toward given goals, as opposed to following traditional
standards and norms. </p>

<h1> Urbanization </h1>
<p>
Urbanization is the movement of population from rural to urban areas and
the resulting increasing proportion of a population that resides in urban
rather than rural places. Thompson Warren in Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences
has defined it as “the movement of people from communities concerned
chiefly or solely with agriculture to other communities, generally larger
whose activities are primarily centred in government, trade, manufacture, or
allied interests”. According to Anderson (1953: 11), urbanization is not a
one way process but it is a two—way process. It involves not only movement
from villages to cities and change from agricultural occupation to business,
trade, service and profession, but it also involves change in the migrants’
attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviour patterns. He has given five character-
istics urbanization: money economy, civil administration, cultural changes,
written records and innovations.  </p>

<h1> Urbanism </h1>
<p>
Urbanism is a way of life. It reflects an organization of society in terms of a
complex division of labour, high levels of technology, high mobility, interde-
pendence of its members in fulfilling economic functions and impersonality in
social relations (Theodorson, 1969: 453).  </p>

<h1> Characteristics of Urbanism or Urban System </h1>
<p>
Louis Writh (1938: 49) has given four characteristics of urbanism:
0 Tansiency: An urban inhabitant’ s relations with others last only for
  a short time; he tends to forget his old acquaintances and develop
  relations with new people. Since he is not much attached to his
  neighbours, members of the social groups, he does not mind leaving
  their places. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000326">326</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:326
</h1>
<p>
0 Superficiality: An urban person has the limited number of persons
with whom he interacts and his relations with them are impersonal
and formal. People meet each other in highly segmental roles. They
are dependent on more people for the satisfaction of their life needs.

0 Anonymity: Urbanites do not know each other intimately. Personal
mutual acquaintanship between the inhabitants which ordinarily is
found in a neighbourhood is lacking.

0 Individualism: People give more importance to their own vested
interests.  </p>
<p>
Ruth Glass (1956: 32) has given the following characteristics of
urbanism: mobility, anonymity, individualism, impersonal relations, social
differentiation, transience and organic type of solidarity. Anderson (1953:2)
has listed three characteristics of urbanism: adjustability, mobility and
diffusion. Marshall Clinard (1957) has talked of rapid social change, conflict
between norms and values, increasing mobility of population, emphasis on
material things and decline in intimate interpersonal communication as
important characteristics of urbanism. K. Dewis (1953) has highlighted eight
characteristics of the urban social system: social heterogeneity (people of
different religions, languages, castes, and classes live in urban areas. There is
also specialization in occupation), secondary association, social mobility,
individualism, spatial segregation, social tolerance, secondary control and
voluntary associations. Lious Wirth (1938: 124) has given five characteristics
of urbanism: heterogeneity of population, specialization of function,
anonymity, impersonality and standardization of life and behaviour. Though
these characteristics present an exaggerated picture of the urban man and his
life, an analysis thereof is necessary.  </p>
<p>
(a) Heterogeneity of population. The large population in cities can be
largely attributed to migration from different areas which leads to people of
different backgrounds and beliefs living together. This mixture of people
affects the working of informal controls—mores and institutions—and
reliance on formally designed mechanisms for regulating the behaviour of
individuals and groups increases. People no longer share the common senti-
ments, and being exposed to new ideas imported from other cultures through
contacts with migrants, they challenge the outmoded beliefs and practices and
adopt such new attitudes and lifestyles which help them in improving their
economic status and coping with problems of adjustment. The influence of
family and neighbourhood decreases and people come into conflict on the
question of rightness of behaviour.  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000327">327</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:327
</h1>
<p>
(b) Specialization of function and behaviour: The heterogeneity and the
large size of population of a city favour the development of specialization.
Since the city has many facets of life and an individual can participate only in
some of them, he becomes choosy and takes interest only in a few fields.
Specialization in function encourages a diversity of life patterns. Doctors,
engineers, businessmen, lawyers, bureaucrats, factory workers, teachers,
clerks, policemen, for example, have different life patterns, different interests,
and also different philosophy of life. Each specialist group makes its own
contribution to the community and thus a division of labour is created. The
cloth merchant say, sells only cloth, and depends on many other specialists to
manufacture, process and distribute cloth so that it reaches his shop. Such a
division of labour permits an individual to benefit from a broader range of
services than his own knowledge and capabilities provide. Each inhabitant in
the city becomes dependent on specialists such as physicians, masons,
mechanics, shopkeepers, tailors, washermen, and so on. He need not learn the
techniques of each profession. </p>
<p>
  Specialization provides to an individual diverse opportunities to act, to
express himself and to develop his potentialities. However, the contacts
become secondary and formal and the sense of living a common life and
having common concerns is destroyed. The relationship between two persons
remains for a short duration till they gratify each other’s purpose. </p>
<p>
In a social order characterized by a heterogeneous population and
diversity in behaviour patterns, there is a greater likelihood of confusion
among several alternatives for proper behaviour in a given situation. For
example, a student finds other student using unfair means and getting first
division. He then thinks, should he do the same thing? One person finds
another person giving Rs 10,000 and getting a job of a police sub-inspector. He
becomes confused whether he should report the case and get the bribe-taker
arrested, or should he develop an attitude of indifference? These moral, social,
and legal dilemmas are overwhelming in the city life. </p>
<p>
(c) Anonymity and impersonality: High population density in the city
erodes a sense of personal identity leading to loneliness and a loss of a sense of
belonging. Hundreds of people watch a movie in a picture-house, enjoy and
laugh together but when the film ends, the common emotions disintegrate
into anonymity and impersonality. On the other hand, this very anonymity
is the crux of personal freedom. The lack of interest in others releases the
individual from heavy pressures towards conformity. In many cases, his
responsibility to others ends with payment. Even when he becomes a member  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000328">328</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:328
</h1>
<p>
of a voluntary group like a club for instance, his participation could be
minimum. He does not have to win the acceptance of other members or to
engage in the accommodative process of fitting himself into the frame of their
expectations. He may observe others but he may not necessarily be carried
away by their stimuli.   </p>
<p>
One advantage of anonymity is that individuals are not judged
according to their parents’ lower class status but are evaluated on the basis of
their appearance and behaviour in casual contacts. The anonymity and
impersonality of urban life gives an individual, who aspires for a higher
status, a greater opportunity to take advantage of symbols of higher status,
like wearing attractive clothing, improving his mode of speech and manner
so as to gain the acceptance and to impress persons of high positions,
maintaining contacts with them and ultimately achieving the goals he seeks
through these contacts.  </p>
<p>
(d) Standardization of behaviour: The urban life necessitates an individual
to standardize his behaviour which ultimately helps him and others (with
whom he interacts) to understand each other and make interaction simpler.
For example, a shopkeeper finds the same questions being asked by a
succession of customers. The customers are then seen as types—the person
who haggles over price, the fellow who goes for quality, the man who is
merely looking without any intention of buying, and so on. The experienced
shopkeeper quickly judges the type of customer he is dealing with and uses the
sales strategy he regards as most effective for a particular type of customer.
This helps both the shopkeeper and the customer to handle the sales trans-
action in a simple and quick fashion. Such standardized expectations and
behaviour are part of urban life. Markets, clubs, restaurants, buses,
newspapers, TV, radio, and schools/ colleges present a largely standardized
picture. A person who is unable to fit into such a life finds himself out of step
and is faced with the problem of adjustment. The large size of the city
population lends particular force to the standardization of behaviour. This
does not mean that the divergence of individual orientations is not possible.
      Sorokin and Zimmerman (1962: 56—57) have identified the following
characteristics of the urban social system:   </p>
<p>
(a) Non-agricultural occupation: While agriculture is the main basis of the
rural economy, trade, industry and commerce are the chief supports of
the urban economy. It is this difference in occupation that ensures that
rural people work in natural environments. Urban people on the other
hand work mostly in artificial and unnatural environment in which the
heat, cold and humidity are controlled by innovative skills. According  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000329">329</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:329
</h1>
<p>
to James Williams (1958), working in unnatural environment affects
people’s attitudes and behaviour patterns. It is, thus, because of the
occupational differences that in urban areas we find liberals as well as
conservatives, moderns as well as traditionalists, and unsociables as well
 as sociables.

(b) Size of population: Urban communities are much bigger in size than rural
communities. The availability of job opportunities on one hand, and the
materialistic as well as educational, medical and recreational facilities on
the other hand attract people to cities

(c) Density of population: In villages, people have to live near their fields to
supervise the agricultural pursuits but in urban areas, people’s residence
depends on the location of their offices, market, children’s
school/college and so forth. This leads to a high density of population in
areas which abound in these facilities. In India, the average density of
population per square mile in metropolitan cities varies between 3,000
and 5,000 persons. This high density has its own benefits as well as disad-
vantages. The advantages are that social contacts multiply, all necessary
facilities are easily approachable and selection of friends becomes easier.
The disadvantages are that inhabitants have very formal and impersonal
relations with each other and their mental stresses increase.

(d) Environment: Bernard (1971) has talked of four types of environment:
material (climate), biological (animals and plants), social, physio-social
(machines, gadgets, instruments) and psycho-social (customs, traditions,
institutions, etc.) and composite (economic, political and educational
systems). The urban environment is more polluted. Besides, because of
being surrounded by educational institutions and hence being more
educated, an urban dweller is more rational, secular, and competitive.

(e) Social differentiation: In urban areas, people are differentiated on the
basis of occupations, religion, class, living standards and social beliefs.
Yet, they are dependent on each other and act as a functioning whole.

(f) Social mobility: Urban areas provide opportunities for change in social
status because of which, as compared to villages, there is more upward
mobility in cities. The mobility may be horizontal or vertical. Besides
social mobility, we also find geographical mobility in urban areas.

(g) Social interaction: Relations among urban inhabitants are secondary and
impersonal. People are more concerned with the status and skills of
other persons than with their beliefs and ideologies. Control is also so
formal that many a time it creates deviant behaviour.

(h) Social solidarity: In comparison to mechanical solidarity in rural areas,
there exists organic solidarity in urban areas. In such a solidarity, though
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000330">330</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:330
</h1>
<p>
each person has his own individuality and personality, he depends more
on others for their specialized roles.   </p>
<p>
The above description of the characteristics of urbanism as a way of life
gives a feeling as if personal relations, primary groups and social intimacy do
not exist in the cities. If consciously developed organizations serve the
interests of the individuals, the primary groups also admit members through
birth. Primary group members are tied together by a fusion of concerns for
one another. Their relations are more emotional and intensive. Within the
group, a member performs variety of functions unlike specified functions in
secondary groups. For example, in a family, a mother serves as a cook, a nurse,
a moral instructor and a manager of tensions for the children and the family
members. Although the social change has weakened the bonds of family,
neighbourhood and peer groups yet the old kind of functioning of these
groups has not completely stopped nor have the primary relations vanished.
Performing obligatory roles in the family, maintaining social participation
within the neighbourhood, sharing common interests of castes and, acting as a
source of support to one’ s kin and friends continue to be important and signif-
icant features of urban life. A number of studies in India (like those by K.M.
Kapadia, Sachchidanand, R.K. Mukerjee and MS. Gore) have shown that
rural people who migrate to cities continue to maintain links with their
families and kin in the village. In cities too, they not only share their problems
with persons belonging to the same and adjoining villages but also with
members of their caste. This makes their adaptation to city life easier.   </p>

<h1> Growth of Urban Areas </h1>
<p>
While cities have existed since ancient times, until recently, they represented
only a relatively small proportion of the population. The lives of the great
majority of the people were predominantly shaped by the rural community
or village. The massive growth of cities and metropolitan areas, and the shift
of a significant proportion of the population to urban areas has been a charac-
teristic feature of past six decades or so. Urbanization was an off-shoot of the
industrial revolution which created a demand for a large number of workers
at centralized locations.   </p>
<p>
The growth of cities depends not only on birth and death rates and
migration but also on political, religious historical and economic factors.
Political centres can be the capital of states (e.g., Bhopal, Jaipur, Mumbai,
Kolkata etc.) or the areas of political activities (e.g., Delhi), or the training
centres for the military (e.g., Kharagvasla), or centres for defence production
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000331">331</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:331
</h1>
<p>
(e.g., Jodhpur); economic centres are areas which predominate in trade or
commerce (e.g., Ahmedabad, Surat); industrial towns are places with factories
(e.g., Bhilai, Singrauli, Kota, Ludhiana); the religious cities are those where
people go on pilgrimage (e.g., Hardwar, Varanasi, Allahabad); and educational
centres have educational institutions, e.g., Pilani). </p>
<p>
In India, the urban population in 1971 was 109.11 million, in 1981 it was
159.46 million, in 1991 it was 217.55 million, in 2001 it was 286.12 million and
in 2011 it was 377.1 million (Premi, 2011: 35; Census of India, 2011, Series 1,
Paper 2). While in 1921 the urban population was only 11.3 per cent of the
total population of the country, in 1951 it increased to 17.6 per cent, in 1971
to 20.2 per cent, in 1981 to 23.8 per cent and in 1991 to 25.7 per cent (Census
of India, 1991, Series 1, 2). Again, in the 1911-21 decade, the urban population
increased by 8.3 per cent, in 1921—31 by 19.1 per cent, in 1931—41 by 32 per
in 1941-51 by 41.4 per cent, in 1951—61 by 37 per cent, in 1961—71 by
38.2 per cent, in 1971-81 by 35.4 per cent, and in 1981-91 by 40.4 per cent.
Thus, during the four and a half decades between 1941 and 1985, the growth
rate of urban population was between 3.4 and 3.8 per cent every year. During
1985-90, the average annual growth rate for urban areas was 2.95 per cent as
compared to 1.65 per cent for rural areas for the same period. The growth rate
for urban areas will increase during the next two decades whereas the growth
rate for rural areas will decrease. As per the UN projections, urban areas in
India will be marked by a growth rate of 3.03 per cent during 2015-2020,
while rural areas will have a reduced growth rate of 0.34 per cent during the
corresponding period. Also, as per UN projections, 45.2 per cent people
(about 630 million) will live in urban areas in India by 2025 AD. This is close
to the total population of India in 1981 which was 684 million (The Hindustan
Times, November 29,1995). </p>
<p>
As per the provisional population totals of 2011 Census, of the total
population of India (1,210.2 million), the urban population stands at 377.1
million and, in absolute numbers, has increased by 91 million in the last
decade. Maharashtra has the highest urban population of 50.8 million (13.48%
of the country’s urban population) in the country. Thus, the growth rate of
population in urban areas is 31.80 per cent. </p>
<p>
Settlement with population of one lakh and above are termed as ‘cities’
in contrast to 'towns' that have population below one lakh. While in 1931,
the total number of cities with more than one lakh population was 32, it
increased to 72 in 1951, 107 in 1961, 216 in 1981, 317 in 1991 and 393 in 2001.
Similarly, the number of bigger cities with more than ten lakh population </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000332">332</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:332
</h1>
<p>
increased from 2 in 1941 to 9 in 1971, 12 in 1981, 23 in 1991 and 35 in 2001.
Then, the number of mega cities with population of 50 lakh and above
increased to 6 in 2001 from 4 in 1991—this time Hyderabad and Bengaluru
joined the earlier list containing Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai
(Premi, 2011: 47; Census of India, 1991,2001). Such growth affects the
social, economic and political life of the people. Of the total number of 476
Class I cities in 2001 in India, West Bengal has the largest number of cities
(63), followed by Uttar Pradesh (55), Andhra Pradesh (50), Maharashtra(41)
and Tamil Nadu (35) (Premi, 2011: 65).  </p>

<h1> Social Effects of Urbanization </h1>
<p>
The social effects of urbanization may be analysed in relationship to family,
caste, social status of women and Village life.  </p>

<h1> Urbanization and Family </h1>
<p>
Urbanization affects not only the family structure but also intra- and
inter-family relations, as well as the functions the family performs. Several
empirical studies of urban families conducted by scholars, like I. P. Desai,
K.M. Kapadia and Aileen Ross, have pointed out that urban joint family is
being gradually replaced by nuclear family, the size of the family is
shrinking and kinship relationship is confined to two or three generations
only. In his study of 423 families made in 1955— 57 in Mahuva town in
Gujarat, Desai (1964) found that 5 per cent families were nuclear (residen-
tially as well as functionally), 74 per cent were residentially nuclear but
functionally and/ or substantially (in property) joint, and 21 per cent were
joint in residence and functioning as well as in property. Of the 95 per cent
joint families (joint in functioning and/ or property, and/ or residence), the
degree of functionality was low in 27 per cent cases (that is, they were joint
only in functioning), high in 17 per cent cases (that is, they were joint in
functioning and property), higher in 30 per cent cases (that is, they were
joint in functioning, property and residence but were two-generation
families), and highest in 21 per cent cases (that is, they were joint in
residence, functioning and property and were three-generation families).
This shows that though the structure of urban family is changing, the spirit
of individualism is not growing in the families.  </p>
<p>
Kapadia (1959) in his study of 1,162 families in rural and urban
(Navsari) areas in Gujarat in 1955 found that while in rural areas, for every
two nuclear families there were three joint families; in urban areas, nuclear
families were 10 per cent more than joint families. Ross (1961) in her study  </p>

of 157 Hindu families belonging to middle and upper classes in Bangalore in
1957 found that (1) about three-fifth (or 60%) of the families are nuclear and
two-fifths (or 40%) are joint; (2) of the joint families, 70 per cent are small
joint (couple+unmarried children+married sons without children, or two
or more married brothers with children) and 30 per cent are large joint
families (parents of unmarried children+unmarried children+married sons
with children); (3) the trend today is towards a break with the traditional
joint family form into the nuclear family unit; (4) small joint family is now
the most typical form of family life in urban India; (5) there is a cycle of
family types; (6) a growing number of people now spend at least part of their
lives in single units; and (7) relations with one’s distant kin are breaking or
weakening. </p>
<p>
  R. K. Mukherjee (1973) also, on the basis of his study of 4,120 families in
West Bengal in 1960-61, has said that replacement of joint family by nuclear
family units is a fait accompli. </p>
<p>
 Though intra—family and inter-family relations are changing, it does not
mean that youngsters no longer respect their elders, or children completely
ignore their obligations to their parents and siblings, or wives challenge the
authority of their husbands. The important change is that the
‘husband-dominant’ family is being replaced by ‘equalitarian’ family where
wife is given a share in decision-making processes. The parents also no longer
impose their authority on the children nor do the children blindly obey the
commands of their parents. The attitude of youngsters is motivated by respect
rather than fear. I.P. Desai maintains that “in spite of strains between the
younger and older generations,, the attachment of the children to their
families is seldom weakened”. M S. Gore (1968) writes. “even in joint family,
the eldest male consults his children and this consultation is not formal”. Ross
(1961), however, thinks that “the feelings of family obligation and emotional
attachment to family members will almost certainly weaken and the
authority of the patriarch break down. When this happens, there will be little
left for identity within the larger kinship group”. Our own feeling is that
family in urban India (and for that matter in the whole country) will never
disintegrate but it will remain a strong unit. </p>

<h1> Urbanization and Caste </h1>
<p>
Caste identity tends to diminish with urbanization, education and the devel-
opment of an orientation towards individual achievement and modern
status symbols. Urbanites participate in networks which include persons of </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000334">334</pagenum>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
several castes. According to Rajni Kothari, the structure of particularistic
loyalties has been overlaid by a more sophisticated system of social and
political participation with crosscutting allegiances. Andre Beteille (1966:
209-10) has pointed out that among the westernized elite, class ties are much
more important than caste ties. </p>
<p>
The educated members of some castes with modern occupations
sometimes organize as a pressure group. As such, a caste association competes
as a corporate body with other pressure groups for political and economic
resources. This type of organization represents a new kind of solidarity. These
competing units function more as social classes than as caste structures. </p>
<p>
Yet another change that we find today is the fusion of sub-castes and
fusion of castes. Kolenda (1984: 150—51) has identified three kinds of fusion: (i)
on the job and in newer neighbourhoods in the city, persons of different
sub-castes and of different castes meet. They are usually of approximately
equal rank. Neighbourhood or office group solidarity develops. This has been
found common in the government colonies in big cities; (ii) inter-sub-caste
marriages take place, promoting a fusion of sub-castes. This is because many a
time it is difficult to find a sufficiently educated groom for an educated
daughter within his own sub-caste, but one may find it in neighbouring
sub-caste; and (iii) democratic politics fosters the fusion of sub-castes and of
adjacent castes. One example is the Dravida Munnetra Kazagam (DMK) and
the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagam (ADMK) parties of Tamil Nadu
composed of the members of higher non-Brahmin castes.  </p>
<p>
Urban dwellers do not conform to caste norms strictly. There is a
change in commensal relations, marital relations, social relations, as well as in
occupational relations. A study of caste system in Bihar revealed that urban-
ization does did affect all characteristics of the caste system uniformly. On the
basis of the study of 200 persons belonging to five different castes (Brahmins,
Rajputs, Dhobis, Ahirs and Chamars), it was found that all respondents had
married in their own castes, though 20 per cent of the respondents living in
cities (against 5% in rural areas) were in favour of intercaste marriages. As
regards occupation, not a single respondent in the city was engaged in his
traditional caste occupation, though 81 per cent respondents in rural areas
were still engaged in their traditional occupations. Likewise, caste solidarity
was not as strong in urban areas as in the rural areas. Caste panchayats were
very weak in cities. G. S. Ghurye (1952), K. M. Kapadia (1959), A. P. Barnabas,
Yogendra Singh, R.K. Mukerjee, M.N. Srinivas, Yogesh Atal and S.C. Dube
have also referred to the impact of urbanization on caste. </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000335">335</pagenum>
<h1>
Urbanization and Status of Women, Page no:335
</h1>
<p>
The status of women in urban areas is higher than that of rural women.
urban women are comparatively educated and liberal. Against 46.13 per cent
literate women in rural areas, there are 72.86 per cent literate women in urban
areas according to the census of 2001. Some of them are working too. As such,
they are not only aware of their economic, social and political rights but they
even use these rights to save themselves from being humiliated and exploited.
The average age of girls at marriage in cities is also higher than the corre-
sponding age in villages. </p>
<p>
  However, in the labour market, women are still in a disadvantaged
situation. The labour market discriminates against women and is opposed to
equality of opportunity—understood in a comprehensive sense to include
equality of employment, training and promotional opportunities. In this
sence, change is not possible in the sex segregated labour market whose struc-
tures ensure that the career patterns of women will normally be marked by
discontinuity, unlike the normal male career patterns which assume conti-
nuity. Because of the constraints of the sex segregated labour market, women
tend to cluster in a limited range of occupations, which have low status and
are poorly paid. Women normally prefer teaching, nursing, social work,
secretarial and clerical jobs—all of which have low status and low remuner-
ation. Even those women who have surmounted the hurdle to professional
education are disadvantaged as they find it difficult to reconcile to the
competing demands of a professional career and home. </p>
<p>
It is difficult for women to remain single or to combine marriage with
career. Apart from the general expectation that all wives must be house-
wives, it has been noted that women are called upon to sacrifice their career
when the need arises, thereby subordinating their own career to that of their
husbands. This often creates frustration among women, leading to psychotic
illness in a few cases. Rural women, however, do not have to face such
problems </p>
<p>
It has been further found that in the cities of India, the high level
education among girls is significantly associated with the smaller family size.
Though education of women has raised the age of marriage and lowered the
birth rate, it has not brought about any radical change in the traditional
pattern of arranged marriages with dowry. Margaret Cormack (1961: 109)
found in her study of 500 university students that girls were ready to go to
college and mix with boys but they wanted their parents to arrange their
marriage. Women want new opportunities but demand old securities as well. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000336">336</pagenum>
<h1>

<p>
They enjoy their newly found freedom but at the same time wish to carry on
with old values. </p>
<p>
Divorce and remarriage are the new phenomena we find among urban
women. Women today take more initiative to break their marriages legally if
they find adjustment after marriage impossible. Surprisingly, a large number
of divorces are sought by women on the grounds of incompatibility and
mental torture. </p>
<p>
Politically also, urban women are more active today. The number of
women contesting elections has increased at every level. They hold important
political positions and also possess independent political ideologies. It may,
thus, be concluded that while rural women continue to be dependent on men
both economically and socially. urban women are comparatively independent
and enjoy greater freedom.  </p>

<h1> Urbanization and Village Life </h1>
<p>
During the past 60 years, urban development in our country has led to the
centrifugal movement of village people to the urban areas that were located
within fairly easy access of public utilities. Many migrated to cities because of
the availability of jobs there. Those who continue to live in villages also enjoy
many of the conveniences of city life, although they are miles removed from
the urban centres. The excellent highways, automobiles, radio, television and
newspapers keep the villagers in contact with the city culture and civilization.
The combination of rural residence and urban employment, and urban
residence and rural contact has resulted not only in certain modifications of
social patterns but also in adjustments to a new way of life. The villagers are
now more aware of the city lifestyle and they have been influenced by it in
such a way that they no longer lay undue emphasis on caste, creed, etc. They
have become more liberal in their approach. They no longer live in isolation.
Many cultivators have accepted the new farm practices. Not only have their
values and aspirations changed but there is a change in their behaviour too.
The jajmani system is weakening and inter—caste and inter-class relations are
changing. There is a change even in institutions of marriage, family and caste
panchayats. Instead of depending on traditional methods of treating the
diseases, they now use modern allopathic medicine. Similarly, in elections,
they give importance not as much to the social status of the candidate as to his
individual potentialities and his political background. </p>
<p>
But this in no way means that traditions have ceased to be important in
villages. Individualism has not been able to replace familism, nor has
secularism been able to replace the bond with the sacred. </p>

Problems of Urbanization, Page no:337
</h1>
<p>
     Urban problems are endless. Drug addiction, pollution, crime, juvenile delin—
quency, begging, alcoholism, corruption and unemployment are a few of
them. Let us analyse the incidence and prevalence of seven crucial problems
that are not covered in other chapters of this book. These are: (i) housing and
Slums, (ii) crowding and depersonalization, (iii) water supply and drainage, (iv)
Transportation and traffic, (v) power shortage, (vi) sanitation, and (vii)
pollution </p>

<h1> Housing and Slums </h1>
<p>
Housing people in the city or abolishing ‘houselessness’ is a serious problem.
Governments, industrialists, capitalists, entrepreneurs, developers,
contractors, and landlords have been unable to keep pace with the housing
needs of the poor and the middle class people. Over 65 million people live in
slums, up from 52 million in 2001 (The Hindu, October 1, 2013). In terms of
urban population, nearly one in every six urban Indian residents lives in a
slum. In other words, roughly 1.37 crore households or 17.4 per cent of urban
households live in a slum (Times of India, May 22, 2013). State—wise, with over
11 million of its residents in slums, in 2011, Maharashtra has the highest slum
population, followed by Andhra Pradesh (10 million), and West Bengal and
Uttar Pradesh (6 million each). In Delhi over 1.7 million residents live in
slums (The Hindu, October 1, 2013). It means more than 17 per cent of the
nation’s families are deprived of houses. Not only this, according to NSSO
(65th round) nearly 28 per cent of the rural households and 6 per cent of the
urban households lived in semi-pucca and nearly 17 per cent of rural house-
holds and 2 per cent of urban households lived in katcha houses.  </p>
<p>
Millions of people are required to pay excessive rent, that is, one which
is beyond their means. In our profit-oriented economy, private developers
and colonizers find little profit in building houses in cities for the poor and
the lower middle class people, and they consider it gainful to concentrate
instead in meeting the housing needs of the rich and the upper middle class.
The result has been higher rents and a scramble for the few available houses.
Almost half of the population are either ill- housed or pay more than 20 per
cent their income on rent. In some states, the Housing Boards and the
city Development Authorities have tried to remedy the city housing
problem with active financial support from the Life Insurance Corporation,
HUDCO and such other agencies. They even charge the total housing cost
in monthly instalments on an interest varying between 10 per cent and 12  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000338">338</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:338
</h1>
<p>
per cent. But engineers and contractors profit a lot from these government
efforts. They use poor quality material in construction and finish the houses
contravening the laid down specifications. The buyer soon finds that the
roof leaks, the plaster peels off, there are cracks in the walls, and the electric
fittings break down. Such ventures bring bad name to housing boards and
even of a few honest bureaucrats associated with such housing schemes. No
wonder, housing in the cities even today continues to be a gigantic problem
next only to food and clothing.  </p>
<p>
The estimated shortage of houses at the end of the Tenth Plan (2007-08)
in urban areas was about 24.71 million dwelling units. Further, an additional
requirement of 1.82 million units has been projected during the Eleventh
Plan, bringing the total housing requirement to 26.53 million units during the
plan period (2007—12).   </p>
<p>
The situation is more or less the same in all the metropolises in the
country. The slum population, governmental efforts notwithstanding, is
expected to show a sizeable increase in the future aggravating to the housing
problem and the squalor conditions. The living conditions in slum areas are
characterized by overcrowding, poor environmental conditions, scarcity of
health and family welfare services and total absence of minimum level of
residential accommodation. As a result, conditions of people living in slums is
far more pathetic than in non-slum areas.  </p>
<p>
Let us take the case of slum dwellers of Delhi, for example. According to
a survey, conducted by Forces, a voluntary organization working on child
care services in India, in 2009, more than half (52%) of Delhi’s population
lived in urban slums with inadequate provision of basic services. In
comparison to Delhi’s infant mortality rate (IMR) of 40, the IMR in slums
was higher at 54 for every 1,000 live births.   </p>
<p>
The immunization level in the slums covered a dismal 34 per cent of the
population and because of the negligence of civic authorities in providing safe
drinking water and sanitation, there was a high incidence of diseases such as
diarrhoea (75%) and anaemia (63%). So far as the nutritional status of the
urban poor in Delhi was concerned, Delhi had 35.4 per cent stunted, 15.5 per
cent wasted and 33.1 per cent underweight children under the age of three
despite being a state with the second highest per capita income in India  </p>
<p>
The report further stated that 31 per cent of Delhi’s slum dwellers had
no sanitation facilities and no underground sewage system. On the plight of
construction workers, the report mentioned that 67 per cent children and 69
per cent women construction workers were undernourished (The Hindu,
December 17, 2009).  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000339">339</pagenum>
<h1>
Crowding and Depersonalization, Page no:339
</h1>
<p>
Crowding (density of population) and people’s apathy to other persons’
problems (including their neighbours’ problems) are some other problems
growing out of city life. Some homes are so overcrowded that five to six
persons live in one room. Some city neighbourhoods are extremely
overcrowded. Overcrowding has very deleterious effects. It encourages
deviant behaviour, spreads diseases, and creates conditions for mental illness,
alcoholism and riots. One effect of dense urban living is people’s apathy and
indifference. City dwellers do not want to ‘get involved’ in other people’s
affairs. Some people do take interest in accidents and in cases of molestations,
assaults and even murders but others choose to be mere onlookers. </p>

<h1>
Water Supply and Drainage
</h1>
<p>
We have reached a stage where no city has round the clock water supply.
Intermittent supply results in a vacuum being created in empty water lines
which often suck in pollutants through leaking joints. Today, inhabitants of
almost all metropolises in India get water supply for less than an hour a day.
Many small towns have no main water supply at all and are dependent on
tubewells. Even a relatively planned and serviced city like Jaipur has now to
reach as far as 150 km to the Bisalpur dam in Ajmer district for augmentation
of water supply. Most towns and cities, which normally get good rain every
year, have now been undergoing the agony of acute water shortage. What
seems to be sadly lacking is a national water policy which would assess the
total water resources and then allocate water. </p>
<p>
 When we look on the other side of the water supply, that is, drainage,
we find the situation equally bad. One of the less known facts about India is
that there is not a single city which is fully sewered. Not even Chandigarh can
claim this distinction because the unauthorized constructions in and around it
lie outside the purview of the main System. Because of the non-existence of a
drainage system, large pools of stagnant water can be seen in every city even in
summer months. Just as we need a national water policy, we also need a
national and regional drainage policy. </p>

<h1>
Transportation and Traffic
</h1>
<p>
The transportation and traffic Scenario in all Indian cities is unhappy. A
majority of people use buses and auto-rickshaws, while a few use rail/metro as
transit system. The increasing number of scooters, motorcycles and cars
makes the traffic problem worse. For example, in Delhi, the vehicular </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000340">340</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:340
</h1>
<p>
population has registered a big jump of more than 135 percentage
points—from 31.64 lakh in 1999—2000 to 74.53 lakh in 2011-12, according to
Delhi Economic Survey. Over the ten years, since 2001, Pune has surpassed
even Mumbai in number of households using cars and similar vehicles for
commuting. Of the 35 districts in the state, Pune has 13.2 per cent such house-
holds whereas Mumbai suburban district comes second with 12.8 per cent and
the central district of Mumbai comes third with 12.6 per cent (Times of India,
April 16, 2012). Such a large number of vehicles obviously pollute the air. In
India, vehicles in major cities are estimated to account for 70 per cent of CO,
50 per cent of HC, 30—40 per cent of NOX, 30 per cent of SPM and 10 per cent
of the total pollution load of these cities. </p>
<p>
The number of buses plying in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai,
Chennai and Kolkata is not adequate and commuters have to spend about one
to two hours to get into a bus, which means leaving the house two hours in
advance in the morning to reach their place of work and reaching home two
hours late in the evening. The main reason for being in this mess is that the
low income of the commuters forces them to live in areas with cheap accom-
modation which necessitates extensive travel. Further, since our citizens
cannot afford to pay high fares for the use of a public transport system, the
fares have to be kept very low which results in all city bus services sustaining
such annual losses as hamper their expansion or maintenance a fleet adequate
to meet city needs.   </p>

<h1> Power Shortage </h1>
<p>
Closely linked with transportation is the question of power shortage. On
the one hand, the use of electrical gadgets has increased very much in cities,
and on the other hand, the establishment of new industries and the
expansion of the old industries has also increased dependence on electricity.
Most states are not in a position to generate the power that they need with
the result that they remain dependent on the neighbouring states. Conflict
over supplying of power between two states often creates severe power crisis
for people in the city.   </p>

<h1> Sanitation </h1>
<p>
Municipalities and municipal corporations in Indian cities are so riddled with
corruption and inefficiency that they have time for all things but the interest
in sanitation of the city, particularly in removing garbage, cleaning drains and
unclogging sewers. The sweepers rarely and relunctantly perform their
assigned duties and every few months threaten to go on strike on the issue of    </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000341">341</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:341
</h1>
<p>
wages, etc. The garbage disposal fleets operate to a third or half of their
capacity. If removing garbage work is assigned to private contractors, they
always complain of non-payment of money and stop working on slight
pretexts. There is, thus, total lack of motivation to tackle the basic sanitation
needs of the cities. The spread of unauthorized slums in congested urban areas
and lack of civic sense among the settlers in these slums further adds to the
growing mound of filth and diseases. Even the major cities of our country
reflect the sanitation crisis. Of the total municipal solid waste generated in
urban India, i.e., 68.8 million tonnes per year or 1,88,500 tones per day, hardly
50 to 60 per cent is cleared. Similarly, presently, only about 10 per cent of the
waste water generated is treated and the rest is discharged into water sources
without treatment. This is when the total budget of municipal corporations of
cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai runs in thousands of crores of
rupees (e.g., the total budget of Delhi Municipal Corporation for the fiscal
year 2013— 14 13 RS 33,436 crore). Municipal machinery works only in the VIP
areas, totally neglecting the seweage, water or garbage collection in other
colonies. According to UNICEF, lakhs of urban children die or suffer from
diarrhoea, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, etc., because of poor sanitary condi-
tions and water contamination. Many cities report a good number of malaria
and filaria cases every year. More than half our battle against these diseases can
be won if our municipal officials sincerely devote time to cope with sanitation
problem and if our people become more responsible to the need for clean-
liness. The outbreak of the plague in some cities in our country in 1994 has
created some awareness among the officials and the general public but
covering the whole city by seweage, arranging the disposal of garbage,
cleaning drains and community toilets, etc. are such big problems that clean
environment, community hygiene and city sanitation still remain and are
likely to remain serious problems in decades to come. </p>
<p>
   Obviously, the basic problem is excessive urbanization and the resultant
slumming of the cities. But, because our politicians use migrants as vote banks,
they remain unconcerned with taking necessary civic action. Lack of under-
standing at the planning level, lack of coordination between the concerned
agencies, mismanagement of municipalities and lack of necessary funds to be
provided by the state governments will always remain barriers in putting
sanitation maintenance cycle in proper shape. If cities continue to treat
sanitation and sewage as low-priority areas, overcoming health crisis in urban
areas will be an insurmountable task in years to come. As a long-term remedy,
what is needed is using new techniques of refuse collection, new technology
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000342">342</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:342
</h1>
<p>
   for the disposal of garbage, a fundamental change in the mumcipal infra-
structure and land use planning.  </p>

<h1> Pollution </h1>
<p>
Our cities and towns are major polluters of the environment. As stated above,
most cities discharge 90 per cent of their entire sewage and industrial effluents
untreated into the nearby rivers. Likewise, the small towns contribute their
share of garbage and excreta to the nearest waterway through its open drains.
Urban industry pollutes the atmosphere with smoke and toxic gases from its
chimneys. Areas recording higher levels of air pollution abound with many
ailments which particularly affect children below five years and people above
fifty years of age. The high synergistic effect of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, etc. causes these diseases. The ambient air quality in Delhi gives it the
dubious distinction of being the 12th most polluted city in the world,
according to WHO.</p>
<p>
The issue of environmental pollution in urban areas is consider so
significant that even the Supreme Court, from time to time, ordered for the
strict enforcement of environmental laws. For example, in July 1995, it
ordered for closure or relocation of about 146 hazardous industries in Delhi
by November-December 1996. The orders led to even agitations among the
affected workers in December 1996, but the apex court stuck to its decision of
not locating industries within the National Capital Region (NCR) but
shifting them any where in the neighbouring states. In Delhi, the main contri-
butors of air pollution, as a recent study shows, are road dust (50%) and
industry (23%)—vehicles account for only 7 per cent (cited in Hindustan
Times, January 19, 2011). </p>
<p>
Similar significant role was played by the Supreme Court in yet another
judgment on environment protection in Andhra Pradesh in October 1996.
The judgment banned shrimp (small marine fish) culture within 500 metres of
the high tide line along the 6,000 km coastline and dismantling of all struc-
tures within the restricted zone by March 1997. The country earns more than
Rs 600 crore in foreign exchange through export of shrimp from Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu alone. According to an estimate by the Central
Pollution Control Board, the effluent generation from acquaculture farms in
the east coast alone was about 2.37 million cubic meres (The Hindustan Times,
January 6, 1997). The poison we put in the environment comes right back to
us through our air, water and food, slowly seeping into our bodies and
showing up as cancer, immune disorders or as hormonal system disorders. No
wonder, the doctors claim that the worsening environmental condition in </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000343">343</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:343
</h1>
<p>
India has increased the chances of catching cancer dramatically in the four
metros—Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai—the chances of having
cancer are as high as 7 to 11 per cent during a life time. A conservative estimate
of cancer patients in India by the year 2012 stands at 28 lakh. Of course, the
poor suffer more than the rich from environmental degradation. </p>

<h1> Causes of Urban Problems </h1>
<p>
Following Mc Veigh and Schostak (1978: 198-205), who have linked urban
problems in the United States to four factors, we can identify following five
major causes of problems of urban life in India: (i) migration in and out of the
city, (ii) industrial growth, (iii) apathy of the government, (iv) defective town
planning, and (v) vested interest forces. </p>

<h1> Migration </h1>
<p>
As already indicated, people migrate to towns/ cities because of the relatively
better employment opportunities available there. In India, the migration has
four patterns: rural to rural, rural to urban, urban to urban and urban to rural.
Though rural to rural migration is by far the most prevalent form of
movement but rural to urban and urban to urban migration is equally crucial.
As per 2001 Census, out of 315 million migrants, enumerated on the basis of
last residence, 98 million had changed their place of residence in the last ten
years. Out of these, 81 million were intra—state migrants. The stream was
dominated by female migrants. Most of these migrants were related to
marriage. States like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana attracted
migrants from other states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Maharashtra
occupied first place with 2.3 million net in-migrants. </p>
<p>
 The entrance of the rural poor into the city depletes sources of revenue.
On the other hand, the rich people today prefer to live in sub-urban areas.
This movement of the rich causes financial loss to the city. This migration to
the city and away from the city aggravates problems. </p>

<h1> Industrial Growth </h1>
<p>
While the annual urban population growth rate was 2.32 per cent (2010) in
India according to a World Bank report, the industrial growth rate was 7.8 per
cent in 2010—11 (in 2009—10, it was 10.5%) per annum. This growth was
expected to take care of the additional job requirements in the cities. The
tertiary sector also provides refuge to the migrants, though. their earnings
remain at low level. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000344">344</pagenum>
<h1>
	Page no:344
</h1>

<h1>
	Apathy of the Government
</h1>

<p>
	The administrative mismanagement of our cities is also responsible for the
mess in which city dwellers find themselves. Municipal governments have not
kept pace with city growth, either spatially or in terms of management infra-
structure. There is neither the will nor the capacity to plan for the future
There is also no skill and capability to manage what exists. Until we improve
the capacity of our cities to govern themselves, we cannot emerge from the
urban mess. On the other hand, the state governments also put many restric-
tions on local governments in raising necessary funds for dealing with
particular urban problems.
</p>

<h1>

Defective Town Planning
</h1>
<p>

A more alarming factor in the general deterioration in the standard of civic
services is the growing sense of helplessness of our planners and adminis-
trators. From the Planning Commission downwards, there seems to be a
fatalistic acceptance of the uncontrolled growth in our metropolitan cities. In
fact, there IS a feeling that very little 18 being done 1n our country to plan the
growth of the cities in a proper way.
</p>

<h1>
	Vested Interests
</h1>

<p>
	The last cause of urban problems is the vested interests that work against
people but enhance private commercial interests and profits. The city
residents are usually powerless to affect decisions that the elite make to further
their own interests, power and profit. When these powerful elite can make
more money, they adopt plans and programmes no matter how many people
are hurt 1n the process.
</p>

<h1>
	Solutions to Urban Problems
</h1>

<p>
	Some measures have to be adopted if we want to remedy urban problems. The
measures suggested are as follows:

	Systematic Development of Urban Centres and Creation of Job
Opportunities
</h1>

<p>
	One 1mportant solution to our urban problems 18 the systematic development
of the fast growing urban centres and planning an investment programme
which, over the next 20 years or so, could give rise to a large number of well
distributed, viable urban centres throughout the country. So far we have been
focusing attention on programmes for providing wage employment in rural
areas through schemes like MNREGS to hold people back in the villages
</p>

</h1>
<p>
	While there is ample justification for providing rural employment, this by
itself is not enough. It is not possible to provide gainful employment in the
agricultural sector beyond a certain point. For this purpose, we have to
emphasize on programmes which can permit multifunctional activities to
sustain people in cities.
</p>

<h1>
	Regional Planning along with City Planning
</h1>

<p>
Urban planning is almost city- centred. We have always been talking of town
and city planning but never of the planned development of the whole region
so that population is logically dispersed and activities are properly distributed.
city planning is an ad-hoc solution but regional planning could be a more
lasting one. For example, instead of providing houses to slum dwellers in cities
through city development authorities, if through regional planning migrants
could  be diverted to other areas which may provide attractive employment,
the pace of growth of existing cities could be checked.
</p>

<h1>
	Encouraging Industries to Move to Backward Areas
</h1>

<p>
	Land pricing policy which gives land in large chunks at throwaway prices has
to be replanned to encourage industries to move to backward areas/ districts.
This will also take care of linear development of metropolitan and big cities. A
policy of the state taking over potential high value land in and around large
cities with  a view to exploiting its full cost at a later date also needs serious
consideration.
</p>

<h1>
	Municipalities to Find Own Financial Resources
</h1>

<p>
	People do not mind paying taxes to the municipality if their money is
properly utilized to maintain roads, provide sewage system, reduce water
shortage and provide electricity. It IS a well— known fact that cities suffer
from crippling resource constraints. If deterrent punishment is given to the
corrupt municipality officials, there is no reason why the municipal corpo-
rations should find it difficult in collecting money from the residents of the
city. A City  must bear the cost of its own development. High financial
support from state government is becoming difficult. By revising property,
water and electricity taxes, money can be collected and more money per
head per annum can be made available for providing necessary amenities.
when any new industry or business is located in a city or on its periphery, it
could be moderately taxed. so that additional money becomes available to
the local body.

<h1>
	Encouraging Private Transport
</h1>
<p>
Why should city transport be a public monopoly? When the transport is
handled by state employees, it has been noticed that they tend to have
extremely rudely and callously. Backing of the trade union encourages them
to go on strikes frequently. It 13 necessary then that private transportation be
encouraged. Privately operated mini bus and tempo services will change a
little more fare but commuters would not mind paying this 1n View of the
better services.
</p>

<h1>
	Amendment of Rent Control Acts
</h1>

<p>
Laws which inhibit the construction of new houses or giving of houses on
rent must be amended. Which landlord would like to spend lakhs of rupees
on a two-three room tenement and give it on rent for Rs 10-15 thousand a
month or so for the next 10 to 20'years without having the authority to
increase the rent or get it vacated on appropriate grounds. A few states like
Maharashtra has taken a lead in amending the Rent Control Act which has
made thousands of houses available for rent. A similar step in other states
would be welcome.
</p>

<h1>
	Adopting Pragmatic Housing Policy
</h1>
<p>
In India, the policies of urban development and housing have come a long
way since 1950. Actually, the pressure of increasing urban population and
lack of housing and basic services were very much evident at the time of
independence. Though, in almost every five-year plan, there has been an
emphasis on solving urban problems, no concrete outcome has come out
even after six decades of planning. Not only this, the government has also
framed a number of policies, the recent one being the National Urban
Housing and Habitat Policy, 2007, which intends to promote sustainable
development of habitat 1n the country with a view to ensuring equitable
supply of land, shelter and services at affordable prices to all sections of
society. In fact, the government policy and planning has to be more down to
earth. This is not to say that the concept of NHP is irrational. The NHP
strategy is broad-based. It seeks to provide easy access to finance as well as
land and materials for building houses at reasonable rates. It also seeks to
encourage manufacturers to use new type of building materials. Moreover, it
seeks to review the entire gamut of laws relating to land tenure, land acqqui-
sition and ceiling to apartment ownership, municipal regulations and rental
laws. But, these are all thorny issues. In recent years, we have seen that the

</p>
<p>
	SHP is oriented towards rich developers, landlords and contractors. The
SHP has to discourage luxury housing and promote cooperative and group
using societies. It has to develop special schemes for the poor and
How-income people. It has also to favour providing incentives to employers
to build houses for the employees. Unless a more pragmatic NHP is
adopted, it will be impossible to achieve the set goals.
</p>

'<h1>
	 structural Decentralization
</h1>

<p>
	one proposal by innovative planners and some radicals envision a structural
decentralization of local self-government itself. This could entail the creation
of ‘neighbourhood action groups’, to be called ‘community centres’ consisting
of representatives of residents and municipality officials. These centres will
identify and act upon neighbourhood needs. For example, many new colonies
have come to be established in many cities in which as many as 10,000 to
50,000 people reside. Thus, these colonies are small towns by themselves.
some taxes like house tax, road tax, light tax, etc., could be passed on directly
to these community centres instead of giving them to municipalities. The
centres would direct the affairs of the neighbourhood without reference to the
city municipal corporation and use the collected money in maintaining roads,
lights and so forth. The argument for this kind of decentralized structure
within  the city is that the same system that allows lakhs of people a substantial
control over their civic destiny denies them an effective role in shaping the
institutions that shape their lives. Community centres will allow them to
create their own exclusive environment.
</p>

<p>
	To conclude, it may be pointed out that the effects of urbanization and
urbanism and the problems of cities can never be solved until urban planning
modified and radical measures are taken. These should not be based on the
profit motive which would benefit a few vested interests. The use of land,
technology, and taxes should be for the benefit of the people and not for the
benefit of a few powerful interest groups. City dwellers have to become politi-
cally active  and organize themselves and agitate to change the existing
economic and social systems in the cities.

<h1>
	globalization and Consumerism, Page no:349
</h1>

<p>
	Two threads that weave our era, particularly the quandary of the contem-
porary times, are that of globalization and consumerism. Both have
intervened social, cultural, economic and environment spheres and have even
altered the sense of identity and generated new forms of subjectivity.
Speaking of handedly, consumerism has made the transformation of
citizens into global shoppers and globalization has transformed citizens of
nation-states into global citizens. However, a simple definition of global-
ization would describe the term as the process by which businesses or other
organizations develop international inﬂuence or start operating on an interna-
tional scale. Meanwhile, consumerism is a social and economic order that
encourages the purchase of goods and services in ever-greater amounts.
consumerism is tied in with the concept of globalization—making the
world one economy and marketplace—and popular culture plays an
important role in connecting the two. According to one approach, consum-
erism is a virtue because popular culture makes people want material things,
but another  point of view looks at consumerism as a force breeding proﬁt
motive and hence exploitative.
George Soros takes globalization to “mean the development of global
financial  markets, the growth of transnational corporation, and their
increasing domination over national economies” (2002: 1). In other words, it
understood as the global distribution of production of goods and services
trough reduction of barriers in international trade such as tariff, export fees
and import quotas.

<h1>
	Tracing the History of Globalization
</h1>;
<p>
	According to a popular viewpoint, globalization originated in the modern
age, towards the end of World War H, as a result of development and connec-
tivity. What followed was exchange across borders 1n terms of trade, ideas and
culture. However, a counter-argument would trace its origins to ancient civili-
zation and point at the trade links between the Indus Valley civilization and
the Sumerian civilization. Thereafter, trade had taken place among countries
including Greece, Egypt, Roman Empire and so on. It was in regard to the
need for trade that various trade routes—Silk Route is one such
example—developed.
</p>

<p>
	According to Andre Gunder Frank, “there was a single global world
economy with a worldwide division of labour and multilateral trade from
1500 onward” (1998: 52), while Jerry Bentley argues that even before 1500,
“trade networks reached almost all regions of Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa
and large volumes of commerce encouraged specialization of agricultural and
industrial production” (1999: 7). In fact, some attach globalization explosion
to the year 1492, when Christopher Colombus stumbled on the Americas in
search of spices, and 1498, when Vasco da Gama made an end run around
Africa and snatched monopoly rents away from the Arab and Venetian spice
traders, while looking at the period after 1500 as inaugurating “a genuinely
global epoch of world history” (Bentley, 1996: 768-969).
</p>

<p>
	The industrial revolution in the 19th century was one of the major
periods in the history of globalization, for there was a significant increase in
the quantity and quality of products and it led to higher exports and better
trade relations. It was colonialism and imperialism that further contributed to
the trade. And, with the World War I, the period referred to as
‘pre-globalization’ came to an end.
</p> 5

<p>
	Globalization, as it is understood 1n a modern sense, came into existence
after the Second World War. After the war, the leaders of the world decided
to bring down the barriers and promote trade relations among various
countries across the globe. Moreover, with countries like India, Sri lanka and
Indonesia gaining independence, the need for economic cooperation among
nations became essential.
</p>

<p>
	The next step was establishment of United Nations Organization and
henceforth, the creation of World Trade Organization and International
Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund identifies four basic
aspects of globalization (IMF, 2000):
° Trade and transactions: With the beginning of the 20th century, inter-
national trade and business flourished, mainly because of improved

	transportation and communication, special economic zones, tax
competition among governments and countries.
</h1>

<p>
	Flow of capital: It is through a rapid increase in cross-border
movement of goods, service, technology and, more importantly,
capital that national economies across the world become increasingly
interdependent economically. This is also referred to as economic
globalization, which comprises the globalization of production,
markets, competition, technology, corporations and industries
(Joshi, 2009).

</p>
<p>
	Movement of people: Cross—cultural contact across countries and
nations has been possible as a result of globalization. International
migration, for work or marriage, travel and transit, all have trans-
formed people into global citizens.

</p>
<p>
	 Distribution of knowledge, accessibility to information: Internet can be
looked at as both a product and a catalyst of globalization.
However, for a better understanding, we could discuss globalization
</p>
 <h1>
	Under the following broader categories:
</h1>

<p>
	Economic: According to Shangquan (2000), economic globalization refers
to the increasing interdependence of world economies as a result of the
growing scale of crOss-border trade of commodities and services, flow of
international capital and wide and rapid spread of technologies. It reﬂects
the continuing expansion and mutual integration of market frontiers, and
is an irreversible trend for the economic development in the whole world
at the turn of the millennium. The rapid growing signiﬁcance of infor-
mation in all types of productive activities and marketization are the two
major driving forces for economic globalization.

</p>
<p>
	Cultural: Cultural globalization is the rapid movement of ideas, attitudes
and values across national borders. As early as the 19605, the Canadian
literary critic Marshall McLuhan popularized the term ‘global village’ to
describe the effect that the ability to connect and exchange ideas instanta-
neous1y would bring to the world. This sharing of ideas generally leads
to greater interconnectedness and interaction between peoples of diverse
cultures and ways of life, which can have both positive and negative
results. Consequently, as technology has accelerated the process, it has
sparked off considerable controversy.
</p>

<p>
	With global ecological changes, an ever more integrated global
economy, and other global trends, political activity increasingly takes
place at the global level. According to V. M. Moghadam, political global-
ization “refers to an increasing trend toward multilateralism (in which
the United Nations plays a key role), toward an emerging ‘transnational
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000352">352</pagenum>

<p>
	state apparatus,’ and toward the emergence of national and international
non-governmental organizations that act as watchdogs over govern-
ments and have increased their activities and influence” (2005: 35)

</p>
<p>
	In case of India, the economy was opened up in the early nineties,
following a major crisis as a result of a foreign exchange crunch. The new
economic reforms, thereafter, fell under the heads of liberalization, Privat-
ization and globalization (LPG). Thus, the LPG model aimed at making
Indian economy as the fastest growing and the most competitive in the world.
The major measures initiated as part of the plan included devaluation, disin-
vestment, dismantling of the industrial licensing regime, allowing foreign
direct investment and removal of quantitative restriction on imports, besides
ﬁnancial sector reforms.

</p>
<p>
	In the realm of culture, India too. received an exposure. As part of
cultural globalization, the transnational movement of media, which followed
economic liberalization, led to competition between cable television offerings
and the state-run television and that between Hollywood films and local
Hindi ﬁlms. Arjun Appudurai famously argued that as a result of global
ization, “culture had become an arena for conscious choice, justification and
representation” (2006: 44). While the Indian diaspora played a significant role
in the movement of cultures across borders, ‘Americanization’ of Indian
culture was also a byproduct of global exchanges.

</p>
<h1>
	Impact of Globalization
</h1>

<p>
	Globalization has, undoubtedly, led to growing competition across the globe.
There are beneficial aspects that increase production and efficiency. Compae-
tition and increasing market space can lead to specialization and an improved
division of labour. There are also economies of scale and scope that have
salutary effects on costs and prices and which provide a strong impetus for
economic growth. On the other hand, the ‘costs’ of globalization can lead to
conﬂicts at various levels, especially since many of the beneficiaries of global-
ization have been the richer countries of the OECD. The net result has not
been convergence" but rather divergence of incomes worldwide, with rapid
growth economies, mainly Asian, joining richer nations, but with poor
nations of Africa, Latin America, and even some in East and Central Europe
slipping further behind. The issue of distribution becomes a major normative
challenge and source of disaffection. There are also regional and global insta-
bilities that are rooted in the interdependencies of economies. These are
manifested in local economic fluctuations and crises in one country having
regional and even global impacts.
</p>

<h1>
	The Positives
</h1>
<p>
	 Better organized markets: For a growing economy, well-organized and
effectual markets are essential. If there are willing buyers who are ready
to pay for quality products and services that are on sale, a healthy
balance can be maintained that facilitates an efﬁcient market. With open
economies and better trade, outsourcing of products/ services is possible
and, thereby, improvement in the quality, and that too at a reduced cost,
if possible. A lower selling price could result in increased demand and
affordability.
</p>
<p>
	Increased competition: More the producers, better the quality of goods
and services, as per the demand of the competition. And, consumers will
only benefit from such a situation. As trade crossed international
borders, there were more choices available and standards would be
raised. Also, each producer will be 1n a constant process of 1mproving
the product and at times will bring down the prices.
</p>
<p>
	Promotion of free commerce and trade. The abolition of various double
taxes, tariffs and capital controls, reduction of transport cost and devel-
Opment of infrastructure have made free trade possible. Moreover,
globahzanon has resulted 1n many businesses setting up or buying opera-
tions 1n other countries. When a foreign company invests in a country,
perhaps by building a factory or a shopping mall, this is called inward
investment and the companies that operate in several countries are called
multinational corporations (MN Cs) or transnational corporations
(TNCs). For example, the US fast-food chain McDonald’s is an MNC,
with nearly 30,000 restaurants in 119 countries. Global corporations
provide impetus to development and growth of economy.
</p>
<p>
	cultural exchange. The sharing of ideas, experiences and lifestyles of
people and cultures. People can experience foods and other products not
previously available 1n their countries.
</p>
<p>
	More tolerant: Socially we have become more open and tolerant towards
each other, and people who live in the other parts of the world are now
not considered aliens. A condition is created where human rights could
flourish.
</p>

<h1>
	The Negatives
</h1>
<p>
	Interdependence: Since all economies are connected together, when one
market falls, the world’s economy collapses. For mstance, when the US
market turns into a disaster, other countries are also affected because the
US loses its buying power.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000354">354</pagenum>

    <h1>
Page no:354
</h1>
<p>
	2. Loss of economic sovereignty: Often, it is the powerful countries, multina-
tional firms and international financial institutions that end up
controlling the economy of a country and, as a result, national sover-
eignty has progressively and systematically undermined. Such cynicism
has led to extreme forms of nationalism, populism, xenophobia and the
emergence of fundamentalist and dissenting political movements.
</p>
<p>
	3. Exploitation: An absence of strictly enforced international laws means
that TNCs may operate in less economically developing countries
(LEDCs) in a way that would not be allowed in a more economically
developed country (MEDC). There 15 a risk that poor working condi-
tions are imposed and local workers are given low wages.
</p>
<p>
	4. Outsourcing: While 1t provides jobs to a population 1n one country, it
takes away those jobs from another country, leaving many without
opportunities.
</p>
<p>
	5. Environment eﬂect: Many believe that globalization 18 one of the most
important factors that has aggravated environmental degradation. The
amount of raw materials needed to run industries and factories is taking
a toll on the natural reserves of planet earth, and pollution has severely
impacted the quality of air that we need so very much for our survival.
</p>
<p>
	6. Loss of the indigenous: In cross-interaction and sharing of ideas and
innovations, the indigenous tradition and culture is lost.
</p>
<h1>
	Consumerism
</h1>
<p>
	Consumerism is a social and economic order that is based on the systematic
creation and promoting a desire to purchase goods and services in greater
amounts. As a social value, it encourages people to purchase as many things as
they possibly can, without questioning the necessity. And, while buying is
essential to the survival of businesses, individuals and society as a Whole,
consumerism encourages people to buy things, attempting to expand the
‘want’ of the people. Advocating that quality is more important than
quantity, it tries to satisfy the consumers. Moreover, consumerism is largely a
media-related idea with the billions of dollars that are spent each year trying to
convince people that if they do not have a particular company’s products,
then their lives will not be as good. Many would argue that consumerism has
emerged through a historical process that has created a capitalist society. it is
shaped by mass markets and cultural attitudes, which warrant as
ever-growing consumption and is also, to an extent, driven by conspicuous
consumption is lavish spending on goods and services acquired mainly for the
purpose of displaying income or wealth and maintaining social status.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000355">355</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:355
</h1>
<h1>
	Historical Background of Consumerism
</h1>

<p>
	The roots of modern consumerism can be traced back to the 18th century.
Before the 18th century, several factors held consumerism at bay, primarily,
he dominant value system of organized religion. Several major religions,
including Christianity and Buddhism, urged their followers to focus on
spiritual goals rather than the acquisition of material goods which interfered
with the goal of attaining salvation. Confucianism, the leading belief system of
the upper class in China, also rejected consumerism” (Stearns, 2001: 3-5).
</p>
<p>
	As the products like sugar, a variety of spices and colourful dyes were
discovered and made available, along with high fashion clothing, there was a
clear increase in demand for these non-essential products. “While demand
for these products increased, for the most part, it was still only the wealthier
class of individuals that could afford these products” (ibid.: 15—23). During
the time period spanning 1800—1920, a number of important events in the
development of consumerism occurred. In 1830, the first departmental store
opened in Paris. By 1850, large departmental stores had spread to other
major cities in Western Europe and the United States. Additionally, mail
order catalogues began to appear and the first advertising agencies were
born. A wide variety of imports and consumer goods became available
(ibid.:45—47). These developments, combined with a number of changes 1n
the psychological profile of society, set the stage for the explosion of
consumerism that would later begin in the 19205. Kanner and Gomes stated:
it is far from clear that consumerism occurs naturally or spontaneously in
humans"(1995: 81). Advertisements and marketing strategies play a role 1n
creating a fascination for products and, thus, promoting consumerism.
kanner and Gomes offer the following observation. “Advertisements do not
simply exaggerate or distort the truth, they lie. No one ’8 success in business,
athletics, or love ever depended on their toothpaste. Modern marketing
techniques rely on the strategy that Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Germany’s
minister of propaganda, called ‘The Big Lie’. Repeat any falsehood
frequently enough, and no matter how absurd it is, people will believe it.
project the image of the totally happy consumer in countless commercials,
and the false consumer self becomes fully internalized as an impossible goal
to which (they) ‘spontaneously aspire ’” (ibid.: 83).
</p>
<p>
	Globally, consumption is directly linked to population growth. As more
and more people are born, the need for resources to support these individuals
increases, and the market for those who manufacture, market, and sell
products and services continues to increase.

</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000356">356</pagenum>

  <h1>
Page no:356
</h1>
<h1>
	Impact of Consumerism
</h1>
<p>
	Consumerism has provided the required momentum for the growth of
economies and has led to healthy competition in the trade markets. On the
other hand, it is also the crux of problems like creation and maintenance of
the false self, spiritual emptiness, detachment from nature, and sustainability
With the rise of consumerism, our global society has become increasingly
focused on consuming goods and services, as a means to feel good above
ourselves and to drive the economies of the world (McKibben, 1989; suzuki,
1997). Also, current levels of consumption are ecologically destructive and
unsustainable, as is noted by Kanner and Comes: “The ecological impacts of
manufacturing, transporting, marketing, packaging, and storing so many
items is incredibly high” (1995: 84).
</p>

<h1>
	The Positives
</h1>

<p>
	1. Consumerism stimulates the economy: People continually spend money is
shops and online and, thereby, huge amounts are regularly pumped into
local and global businesses. For an economy, stimulation is always a
necessity.
</p>
<p>
	2. More awareness: Consumers, in the present times, are more aware of
their rights, the companies rights and they are being made aware of
exactly what they are buying. Be it nutritional information and health
warnings or details about what a product 15 made up of, labels carry all
information m a clear and concise manner.
</p>
<p>
	3. Higher growth: More goods and services are available to chose from
Also, since companies begin to compete to improve sales, there is scope
for 1nnovation.

</p>
<p>
	4. More employment. Increased production will increase employment
opportunities.

</p>
<h1>
	The Negatives
</h1>
<p>
	1. Leﬁ in debt: A negative impact that consumerism has is that it make
anyone that cannot afford to buy the products that they are being
bombarded with feel left out. This leads to a negative effect on people's
attitudes and often leads to people getting credit that they cannot afford
to pay back. This means people are then dealing with debt, which makes
them feel even worse than they did before. It is a vicious cycle.
</p>
<p>
	2. Decline in spiritual values: Material wealth is the deciding factor about
whether a society is highly developed or not. Spiritual values an
undermined. This may not be suitable to a person, particularly who is
appreciative of spiritual values.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000357">357</pagenum>

  <h1>
Page no:357
</h1>
<p>

Ecological imbalance: The natural habitat is being destroyed to create
more goods and build more buildings affecting the weather. Global
warming will eventually result in health problems. Industrial pollution
is affecting people in many ways.
</p>
<p>
	Misuse of land and resources: It is well documented that the depletion of
resources and environmental degradation is directly related to
consumption of goods and services (Brown, 2001; Brower and Leon,
1999; Gardner and Stern, 2002). Activist Vandana Shiva argues:
“Junk-food chains, including KFC and Pizza Hut, are under attack from
major environmental groups because of their environmental impact.
Intensive breeding of livestock and poultry for such restaurants leads to
deforestation, land degradation, and contamination of water sources and
other natural resources. For every pound of red meat, poultry, eggs, and
milk produced, farm fields lose about five pounds of irreplaceable top
soil. The water necessary for meat breeding comes to about 190 gallons
per animal per day, or ten times what a normal Indian family 15 supposed
to use in one day, if it gets water at all” (2000: 70).
</p>
<p>
Pollution: Increased consumption leads to increased levels of pollution.
For instance, take the case of automobiles: more consumption as a result
of consumerism will add to pollution. Other examples include industrial
waste that is dumped into rivers and oceans, waste from the tourist
industry, waste from agriculture, consumer waste such as household
waste, excessive product packaging, the new ‘throw-away’ culture, and
so on. Vandana Shiva writes. “Just between you and me, shouldn’t the

	Gandhiji not only himself deviated from caste norms but also prompted
others not to follow them. Yet, Gandhiji was not considered a deviant because
his deviation was for the good of the society. The deviation that harms the
society is strongly disapproved.
Criminologists with a sociological perspective have not claimed that
there 15 no place for the legal definition of crime in criminology. They have
only drawn attention to situations in which people who engage in ‘criminal
behaviour are either not caught or are acquitted by courts because of inade-
quate evidence or legal loopholes or pressures. Taking the reconciliatory
position between legal and social definitions of crime, Reid (1976: 5) has said
that the legal definition may be used for compiling statistics on crime and for
assigning the label ‘criminal’, but the studies undertaken for studying
causation of crime should include such persons also 1n their sample of‘ .crime
nals’ who admit their crime but are not convicted by court.

	Crime, Criminal and Criminology
</h1>
<p>
	Six questions are important in criminology today (Young, 1975: 249-52)
These are:
1. how is an individual’s criminal behaviour explained? At the point of
committing crime, is the offender perceived as acting out of free-will
or is he seen as compelled by some forces beyond his control?
'2. how 13 the functioning of social order perceived? Is order in society
understood as based on the consent of the vast majority or is it largely
based on the coercion?
3. how 1s crime defined? Is crime seen as the violation of the legal code or as
a behaviour that offends the social code of a particular community?
4. how is extent and distribution of crime viewed? Is crime viewed as a
limited phenomenon committed by asmall number of people, or as the
extensive phenomenon engaged in by a large proportion of the
population? ,
5. how are the causes of crime explained? Are the causes of crime located
primarily within the individual (that is, his personality) or is crime seen
as the product of the wider society within which the individual lives?
6. what 13 the policy regarding criminals? Is the policy of punishing the
offender appropriate or . is the policy of treatment of the criminal
accepted?
These questions can be framed on the basis of dichotomies as follows:
Individual’s behaviour: free-will versus determinism
 Functioning of social order: consensus versus coercion
 Definition of crime: legal versus social

	However, in order to understand the relation between globalization and
consumerism, it is important to take note of the possible access to resources
and markets on a global basis, production of consumers all over the
world—which were not easily available before—and the essential under
standing of globalization and the notion of consumerism. through the
working of the aforementioned factors, consumerism becomes a process the
is triggered off by globalization and eventually the two make up an interre-
lated mechanism.
At present, a variety of resources and products are being consumed
having moved beyond basic needs to include luxury items and technological
innovations. Even though such consumption beyond minimal and basic needs
should not necessarily be negatively perceived, what should be understood is
what lies behind the form of consumption and consumerism in the present
world (Shah, 2006). In the present world, some characteristics of consumption
are: (i) choices of consumption are being inﬂuenced by certain actors, (ii) what
is to be produced and not are being decided by certain actors, (iii) a uniformity
of consumption patterns is being created throughout the world, and (iv)
material value inﬂuences relationships among people (ibid..).
According to United Nations Development Report (1998), global price
ities and expenditure on choices of consumption and consumption patterns
are shown in the charts below:
</p>
<p>
	And compare that to what was estimated as additional costs to achieve
universal access to basic social services in all developing countries:

<p>
	(Shah, 2006, quoting The State of Human Development, United Nations
development Report, 1998, Chapter 1, p. 37). Data from the World Bank for
2003 suggests that these numbers have only very slightly changed in those ﬁve
years (ibid.). Therefore, the changed consumption patterns are imposed 1n the
world as a result of globalized markets.

As mentioned earlier, there 15 a structured system behind the present
prevalent forms of consumption and consumerism that are operating by the
actors of a global economy which have the power to control the global
market forces of a globalized economy. Within this context, there are trends
that have been identified around globalization and consumerism which have
made consumerism an issue at present (ibid.). Some of the trends of
consumption in the present times are:
Inequality of consumption (not redistributing from high- -1ncome to
low-income consumers).
Use of pollutant goods and production technologies instead of
Cleaner ones.
promoting goods that discourage poor producers rather than
promoting goods to empower poor producers.
creating a priority among consumers for consumption to
conspicuous display rather than to meeting basic needs.
Hence, globalization and consumerism today are accelerating the
dynamics of the consumption-poverty-inequality—environment nexus (ibid.).
moreover, two of the major criticisms of globalization and consumerism are
unequal distribution of wealth and unsustainable consumption patterns
(ibid.). one major problem of consumerism is that consumption patterns
today are not to meet everyone’s needs. The system that drives these
consumption patterns contributes to inequality as well as unsustainability.
thus globalization and consumerism create two important issues: (1) patterns
and effects which exacerbate inequalities, and2 (2 ) unsustainable consumption
and the depletion of the environmental resources (ibid.).
praveena Rajkobal (n.d.) has argued that consumerism is critical to the
contemporary forms of globalization and it is also essential to understand the
relationship between globalization and consumerism: “This connection could

<p>
	be grasped in the fact that globalization enables access to resources as well as
markets globally. Furthermore,to this argument, it could be asserted that the
emergence of consumerism parallels the emergence of free market. The
globalization-led consumerism in its nature creates two important issues
which could be taken 1nto debate: the patterns and effects which exacerbate
inequalities and the unsustainable consumption and depletion of the environ-
mental resources.”

To conclude, the most recent obsession to have gripped the government
of our country is to promote consumerism and globalization. Today, the
focus IS on raising the rate of economic growth calculated 1n aggregate terms
not on raising the living standards of those needing 1t most. It is assumed then
the some of the gains will eventually trickle down to the poor. There is no
sign of that; instead, the gulf between the rich and the poor is widening. (it is
also argued that today India has maximum number of millionaires, but at the
same time, the number of those living below the poverty line is also highest is
the world.) The basic problems of unemployment, illiteracy and economic
disparity are not addressed. Agriculture, which sustains the bulk of our
people, is neglected. Their fate is reﬂected in the rising number of suicide
deaths of farmers.

The victims of the cult of consumerism are not only the poor; all
sections of our society are infected. The constant marketing campaign to buy
more has led to spiralling indebtedness. Families have been disrupted, envy
aroused and social tensions exacerbated. The root cause of the sickness is the
view that sees progress and development purely in material terms. No other
values are recognized, certainly not the ethical values of social justice and
other non-material attributes of a healthy society.

	Crime and Criminals
</h1>

<p>
	In India, in 2012, a total of 60,41,559 cognizable crimes were committed, of
which 23,87,188 crimes Were under the IPC category and 36,54,371 crimes
were under the SLL (special and local laws) category. Thus, for every one
hour, about 273 cases of crimes are reported and 373 persons are arrested
under different sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code). In one day, the police
grapples with 94 murders, 205 riots, 75 robberies, 68 rapes and 130
kidnappings and abductions (2012). Between 1953 and 2012, crime had regis-
tered a rise of about 100 per cent or 10.08 times (from 6.09 lakh to 60.41 lakhs
The total cognizable crimes under IPC over the period of 60 years have thus
shown a rising trend except for the years 1954, 1955, 1963, 1968, 1969, 1975
1976, 1979, 1982, 1993 and 2003, when the declining trend was observed
(Crime of India, 2012). The rising wave of crime might cause alarm among the
public but our police and politicians remain unruffled about the deterio-
rating law and order situation. The non-ruling political parties are
concerned with these figures only in one way—they use them to criticize
the policies of the ruling party so that the latter could be defamed and
depowered, yielding place to a new governing elite.
Sociologists and criminologists have been broadly concerned with
locating the causes of crime and analysing the effectiveness of the criminal
justice system. Recently, some scholars have moved beyond these narrow
twin concerns and have raised questions about the enactment of law'
improving the police system, judicial activism, protecting the interests of
victims, improving the condition in prisons and humanizing the deviant.

<h1>
	Concept of Crime
</h1>

<p>
	But let us first look at the concepts of crime and criminals and also identify
Various types of crimes and criminals. Since official statistics are based on the
legal definition of crime, as the system of criminal justice is perceived from a
legal approach, since all empirical studies on criminals focus on crime defined
by law, and since legal definition of crime is considered to be precise,
unambiguous and capable of measurement, let us examine this legal definition
(of crime) first.
Tappan (1960: 10) has defined crime as “an intentional act or omission in
violation of criminal law committed without defence or justification”. Five
elements are important in this definition: (1) It should be an act or omission of
an act, that is, a person cannot be punished for his/ her thoughts. (2) The act
must be voluntary and committed when the actor has control over his
actions. (3) The act should be intentional, whether the intent be general or
specific. A person may not have a specific intent to shoot another person and
kill him, but he is expected to know that his action might result in injury or
death of others. (4) It should be a violation of a criminal law (as distinct from a
non-criminal law or civil and administrative law). This is necessary so that the
state can take action against the accused. (5) It (the act) should be committed
without  defence or justification. Thus, if the act is proved to be in self—defence,
or committed in insanity, it will not be considered a crime even if it causes
harm or injury to others. Ignorance of law is usually not a defence.
Hall Jerome (1947: 8—18) has defined crime as “legally forbidden and
intentional action, which has a harmful impact on social interests, which has a’
criminal intent, and which has legally prescribed punishment for it”. Thus,
according to him, no action is to be viewed as crime unless it has five charac-
teristics: (1) it is legally forbidden, (2) it is intentional, (3) it is harmful (to
society), (4) it has criminal intent, and (5) some penalty is prescribed for it.
crime  has also been defined in non-legal or social terms. Mowrer (1959)
has defIned it as “an anti-social act”. Caldwell (1956: 114) has explained it as
"those acts or failures to act that are considered to be so detrimental to the
well-being of a society, as judged by its prevailing standards, that action
regarding them cannot be entrusted to private initiative or to haphazard
methods but must be taken by an organized society in accordance with tested
procedures”. Thorsten Sellin (1970: 6) has described it as “violation of conduct
norms of  the normative groups”. Clinard (1957: 22) has, however, maintained
,that all deviations from norms are not crimes. He talks of three types of devia-
tions: (i) tolerated deviation, (ii) deviation which is mildly disapproved, and
(iii) deviation which is strongly disapproved. He perceives the third type of
deviation as crime. Let us take one example in order to understand it.

Causes of crime: individual versus social
Policy towards criminals: punishment versus treatment
 Following Fitzgerald (1975: 248-307) and Young et. a]. (1975), a chart
(table 1) can be presented to point out dichotomous reactions of seven
different paradigms on these six questions.

	salient Characteristics of Crime in India
</h1>

<p>
	Given the limitations of ofﬁcial criminal statistics, it is perhaps unwise to
attempt to set forth the seemingly most important facts about crime in Indian
society. It is conceivable that with adequate and valid methods, many of these
'facts' would change drastically. Nevertheless, there seems to be enough
evidence  to support at least the following brief description of crime in our
country:
As stated at the outset, of the total cognizable crimes committed in India
in 2012, about 23.87 lakh were crimes under the IPC (including theft,
burglary, robbery, dacoity, murder, riot, kidnapping, cheating, breach
of trust, etc.) and about 36.54 lakh were offences under the SLL (like
dowry Prohibition Act, Prohibition Act, Gambling Act, Excise Act,
Arms Act, Immoral Trafﬁc Prevention Act, Narcotic Drugs and Psychi-
atric  Substances Act, Railways Act, Explosive Substance Act, etc.). Thus,
the crime rate is not very high in our country in comparison to other
countries. Whereas the crime rate per one lakh population in India in
2012 was 497.9 (Crime in India, 2012: 23), in Canada it was 5,589, in
brain it was 10,404, in the United States it was 5,898, in Japan it was
1,510  and in the Netherlands it was 9,507.
Of about 60 lakh cases of cognizable crimes registered by the police in
2012 about 40 per cent were cases of crimes under the IPC and about 60
per gent were cases of offences committed under the SLL.
The pattern of IPC crimes indicates that of the total offences, 12 per
cent were violent crimes (murder, rape, kidnapping, etc.), 18 per cent
were  property crimes (theft, burglary), 10.2 per cent were crimes
against women, 4.8 per cent were economic crimes (cheating, breach
of trust, counterfeiting) and 55 per cent are other crimes, including
crimes against SCs/STs and children, cyber crimes, etc. (Crime in India,
2012).
Of the total property crimes, 14.1 per cent were related to theft and 3.9
per cent  were related to burglary (Crime in India, 2012). It means, crime
is greater for property offences than for offences against persons
murder, abduction, etc.). The same is true of the United States too,

<p>
	where 77 per cent crimes are property crimes (burglary, larceny,
auto-theft, etc.), and only 23 per cent are crimes against persons (Becker,
1966: 211).
 Of the total persons arrested for offences under the SLL in 2012, about
one-fourth (23.8%) were arrested under three Acts: Prohibition
Act—10.6 per cent, Gambling Act—9.1 per cent and Excise Act—4.1 per
cent. The remaining three-fourths (76.2%) were arrested under Immoral
Traffic Act, Narcotic Drugs Act, Explosives Act, Dowry Prohibition
Act, Essential Commodities Act, TADA, and so on (Crime in India,
2012: 147).
Of the total IPC crimes, about 40 per cent were committed in five
northern states of Uttar Pradesh (8.3%), Maharashtra (8.5%), Madhya
Pradesh (9.2%), Bihar (6.1%) and Rajasthan (7.2%) whereas about 29 per
cent crimes were committed in four southern states of Tamil Nadu
(8.4%), Karnataka (5.6%), Andhra Pradesh (8.1%) and Kerala (6.7%)
(Crime in India, 2012: 200).
 For about/23.87 lakh IPC crimes committed in 2012, more than 32.70
lakh persons were arrested, that is, on an average, 1.4 persons were
.:.arrested for each crime committed. On the other hand, for about 36.54
lakh offences committed under the SLL, more than 41.50 lakh persons
were arrested, that is, on an average, 1.1 persons were arrested for each
crime.
crime rate is much higher for males than females. For example, the
females arrested under various sections of IPC and SLL accounted for
only 6.5 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively in 2012 (Crime in India,
2012: 141).
The ratio of urban offenders is much less than the rural offenders.
Crime rate is highest among those in the low, lower-middle and
middle-middle socio—economic groups.
crime rate is highest (47.6%) in the age group of 30—50 years. The
percentage of convicts in other age groups was. 36 per cent in age group
18-30 years, 16. 4 per cent in 50+ age group (N CRB Snapshots-2011).
last characteristic feature of the Indian criminal scene is the increase
in the organized crime——the growth of large-scale organizations for
criminal activities. What IS being organized more is the control and
distribution of illicit goods and services—drugs (narcotics), girls for
prostitution in India and in Arabian countries, smuggling of gold, etc. In
addition, there are the organized efforts of the mafia groups to control
various legitimate business activities, such as coal mines, unions in indus-
tries and the like. Although the total number of major crimes charged to

<p>
	‘organized crime’ is probably small, its cost and its pattern in cities
provides a distinctive element.
In presenting these facts and features, the idea 1s to point out the
weakening of motives for conformity to social norms and the disruption of
social relationships and social bonds. The unrest is increasing almost in all
sections of our society. There is unrest among youth, peasants, industrial
workers, students, government employees and the minorities. This unrest
increases frustrations and strains which lead to the violation of legal and social
norms. It is, thus, the organization and the functioning of the existing
sub-systems and structures in our society that are more responsible for the
increase in crime. Various sets of ideas about - crime causation have been
developed by a number of scholars, stemming primarily from Durkheim,
moving to scholars like Merton, Cohen, Miller, Cloward and Ohlin. We shall
attempt to analyse some of these viewpoints.
</p>
<h1>
	Theoretical Explanations of Criminal Behaviour
</h1>

<p>
	The theoretical explanations of criminal behaviour have been classiﬁed into
six groups. (i) biological or constitutional explanations, (ii) mental
subnormality, illness and psycho-pathological explanations, (ii1) economic
explanation, (iv) topographical explanation, (v) (human) environmental expla-
nation, and (vi)‘ new ’and ‘radical’ explanation.

Reid (1976: 103—25 1) has classified the theoretical explanations as:(1)
classical and positive theories, (2) physiological, psychiatric and psychological
theories, and (3) sociological theories. He has further sub-classiﬁed the socio-
logical theories in two groups: (i) social structural theories (including
Merton’s, Cohen’s, Cloward and Ohlin’ s, Matza’ s, Miller’ s, and Quinney's
theories), and (ii) social process theories (including Sutherland’ s and Howard
Becker’s theories).

We will discuss these theories by dividing them 1n four groups. (1)
classicist, (2) biogenic, (3) psychogenic, and (4) sociogenic.

	Classicist Explanation
</h1>

<p>
	Classicist explanations of crime and punishment were developed in the second
half of the eighteenth century. In fact, these theoretical explanations developed

</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000370">370</pagenum>


<h1>
	Page no:370

<p>
	as reaction to the enlightened thinkers and political reformers against the
arbitrary systems of Justice and the barbarous codes of punishment which
prevailed up to the eighteenth century. They demanded a legal system that
would defend the mterests of criminals and protect their rights and liberties
They believed 1n the‘ contract theory’ of the origin of state (propounded by
Rousseau), that 15, regulating the conduct of free individuals who were bound to
one another within the society by a free and ‘legal’ contract between free and
equal individuals. Thus, individuals were conceived as free, rat1onal and
sovereign individuals, capable of deﬁning their self-interests and rationally
thinking of the consequences of their actions. They, therefore, thought of
state/ society not as something sovereign but as something which individuals
had contracted to establish for their individual and mutual benefit. Thus, they
sought to limit the power of the state to defence of the rights and liberties, as
well as safety and security of the individual.
The propounder of the classicist explanation was an Italian thinker
Beccaria who was inﬂuenced by the writings of scholars like Bentham and
John Howard. Beccaria and his classical school maintained that (a) human
nature is rational, free, and governed by self-interest, (b) social order is based
on consensus and social contract, (c) crime is the infringement of the legal
code and not of social norm, (d) distribution of crime is limited and is to be
ascertained through a ‘due process’, (e) crime is caused by an individual's
rational motivation, and (f) in punishing the offender, the principle of
‘restraint’ should be observed.
The main postulates of Beccaria’ s classical explanation (Schafer, 1969:
106) developed 1n 1764 were:
1. Man’s behaviour 15 purposive and rational and is based on hedonism or
pleasure-pain principle, that is, he consciously chooses pleasure and
avoids pain.
2. Punishment should be assigned to each crime so that the pain would
outweigh any pleasure from the commission of crime.
3. Punishment should not be severe and deterrent but it should be propor-
tionate to crime and also be predetermined, prompt, and public.
4. The law must apply equally to all citizens.
5. The legislatures should clearly enact the law and prescribe specific
punishment for us violation. The judges should not interpret the law but
should only decide whether a person committed the crime (violated the
law) or not. In other words, courts should only determine 1nnocence or
guilt and thereafter prescribe the set punishment.
The major weaknesses 1n the classical explanation were: (1) all criminals
were to be treated alike without differentiating them on the basis of age, sex or

<p>
	intelligence; (2) no importance was given to the nature of crime (that is,
 whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanour) or the type of the criminal
(that is, whether he was a first offender, a casual offender, a habitual offender,
or a professional offender); (3) explaining an individual’s behaviour merely on
the doctrine of ‘free-will’ and suggesting punishment on the principle of ‘utili-
‘tarianism’ is only an armchair philosophy Which considers crime in the
abstract and lacks a scientific approach in the objective and empirical
measurement; (4) there was no provision for justifiable criminal acts; and (5)
Beccaria and Bentham were more concerned with reform in the criminal law
(like mitigation of severity of punishment, removal of defects in the Jury
system, abolition of transportation and capital punishment and adoption of a
prison philosophy and regulating morality, than in controlling crime or devel-
opment of criminological theories.

The British neo-classicist criminologists revised the classical theory in
1810  and 1819 and provided for judicial discretion and introduced the idea of
minimum and maximum sentences (V old 1958. 25—26). Describing the
concept of equal justice as unreal, they suggested giving importance to age,
mental condition and extenuating circumstances in fixing punishment to
criminals. Children under seven years of age and mentally diseased persons
were to be exempted from the law. However, in spite of these changes, the
neo-lassicists accepted the principles of free-will and hedonism. As such, this
school also has not been considered as a scientific school of criminology.
</p>
<h1>
	Biogenic Explanation
</h1>

<p>
The	positivists rejected the concept of ‘free-will’ advocated by the classicists
and the neo—classicists and emphasized the doctrine of ‘determinism.
Lombroso,  Ferri and Garofalo were the major positivists who emphasized the
biogenic or hereditary aspects of criminal behaviour. (Heredity is the parental
contribution made through 46 chromosomes. Of these, two determine the sex
of the infant and 44 affect other qualities of the body. The combinations and
permutations among the genes determine the infant’s particular genotype,
that is, genetic contribution of an organism).

Lombroso, an Italian physician and professor of Clinical Psychiatry and
Criminal Anthropology and described as the “Father of Criminology”,
Propounded the Theory of Evolutionary Atavism (also called Theory of
physical Criminal Type or Theory of Born Criminals) in 1876. He claimed
that the  criminal is of a different physical type than the non-criminal (1911:
365). A criminal suffers from many physical abnormalities. As such, he can be
identified by a number of characteristics or Stigmata, like asymmetrical face,
large ears, excessively long arms, ﬂattened nose, retreating forehead, tufted

and crispy hair, insensibility to pain, eye defects and other physical peculiar-
ities. Lombroso not only pointed out differences in physical characteristics
between criminals and non—criminals but he also gave characteristics that
distinguished criminals according to the type of crime they committed.

Charles Goring, an English psychiatrist and philosopher, criticized
Lombroso’ s theory on the basis of his own study in which he measured the
characteristics of 3,000 English convicts and a large number of noncriminal in
1913. He maintained that there was no such thing as a physical criminal type.
However, he himself explained crime on the basis of hereditary factors (1919:
11) using the statistical treatment of facts, or what is called the
statistico—mathematical method. But Goringis work was also criticized
because (Reid, 1976: 120—21) (1) he committed the same errors in statistical
analysis for which he had criticized Lombroso. He measured intelligence not
by the available Simon-Binet tests but by his own impression of the mental
ability of the criminals, (2) he completely ignored the impact of environment
on crime, (3) the sample of non-criminals which included undergraduate
university students, inmates of a hospital, mental patients and soldiers was
defective, and (4) he was violently prejudiced against Lombroso.

Though, Ferri and Garofalo too had supported Lombroso but he
(Lombroso) modified his theory at the end of his life and said that all criminals
are not ‘born criminals’. There are ‘criminaloids’ (who are individuals of
normal physical and psychological make-up), occasional criminals, and
criminals by passion. The main criticisms against Lombroso’s theoretical
explanations are: (1) his collection of facts was confined to organic factors and
he neglected the psychic and social factors; (2) his method was mainly
descriptive and not experimental(3) his generalizations about atavism and
degeneracy left a gap between theory and fact. He adjusted facts to fit into his
theory; (4) his generalization (about atavism) was drawn from a single case and
is, therefore unscientific; and (5) his use of statistics was actually not tested by
the data. In spite of these criticisms, Lombroso’s contribution to the devel-
opment of criminological thought has been recognized on the basis that he
redirected emphasis from the crime to the criminal.

Interest on biogenic variables was revised by a Harvard physical anthro
pologist Hooton in 1939. On the basis of his 12 year study of 13,873 male
prisoners compared to a small number of 3,203 male nonoffenders, he
concluded that the primary cause of crime is ‘biological inferiority’. The four
conclusions he drew from his study (1939) were: (1) criminal behaviour is the
direct result of inherited biological inferiority as shown by characteristics like
sloping foreheads, thin lips, straight hair, body hair, small ears, long thin
necks and sloping shoulders, (2) particular types of crime are caused by

<p>
particular types of biological inferiority. Tall and thin men tend to be
murderers and robbers, tall and heavy men tend to be cheats, short statured
and thin men tend to be thieves and burglars, and short heavy men are prone
to commit sexual crimes, (3) criminals are organically inferior, and (4) elimi-
nation of crime can be effected only by the sterilization of the physically and
mentally unfit persons.
He further held that 1n every society, there are a few geniuses, hordes of
mediocres, masses of morons, and regiments of criminals. He gave three types
of biologically inferior people. (i) who are organically unadaptable, (ii)
mentally stunted, and (iii) sociologically warped.
His theory was, however, criticized by Albert Cohen, Alfred
Lindesmith and Karl Schuessler (see Sutherland and Cressay, 1965: 118- 19;
vold, 1958: 59-64; Gibbons, 1977:139-40) on the arguments that. (1) his
control  groups of non-offenders were small 1n size and represented types that
could be expected to be superior intellectually (university students) and physi-
cally stronger (firemen); (2) the sample of criminals was unrepresented as it
was drawn only from an imprisoned population; (3) his research method-
ology was defective; (4) he had no explicit criterion of ‘biological inferiority’;
and (5) he offered no evidence that physical inferiority is hereditary.
Sheldon related crime with physiological make-up or body constitution
in 1940. He classified individuals on the basis of their physique (or body types)
into three groups: endomorphic, ectomorphic and mesomorphic. Individuals
with the first type of physique (with small bones, short limbs, and soft,
smooth and velvety skin) love comfort and luxury and are essentially extro-
verts; those with the second type of physique (with lean, fragile, delicate body,
small delicate bones) are introverts, full of functional complaints, sensitive to
noise,. who complain of chronic fatigue, and shrink from crowds and
individuals; and those with the third type of physique (with strong muscles
and bones, heavy chest and large wrists and hands) are active, dynamic,
assertive and aggressive. Sheldon developed scales for measuring the body-type
dimensions  in which individuals were scored on each component between 1
to 7 scores. However, Sheldon’ s hypothesis that there is a relationship
between delinquent behaviour and body-types and that the delinquents are
somewhat more mesomorphic 1n body structure than are the non-delinquents
has not been convincingly proved. Crime 15 a social process and not a biologi-
cally determined pattern of behaviour.
If we were to compare the main points of the classical school with the
positivist school, we could say that (1) the former emphasized the legal
definition  1 of crime, the latter rejected the legal definition; (2) the former
believed in the doctrine of free-will, the latter believed in determinism; (3) the

	former did not use empirical research, while the latter did; (4) the former
concentrated on crime (in suggesting punishment), the latter on the criminal,
(5) the former suggested death penalty for some offences, the latter recom-
mended abolition of death penalty; and (6) the former was in favour of a
definite sentence, the latter was in favour of an indeterminate sentence.
Besides the above theories, some studies on identical twins have also laid
emphasis on heredity as an important factor in crime. For example, lange
(1931) compared the behaviour of male twins in several prisons With the
non-institutionalized twins. He found that in the case of identical twins (born
of a single fertilized ovum), 10 of the 15 pairs were concordant (both members
of a twin pair having the same characteristics) while in the case of fraternal
twins (born of separate ova), 15 of the 17 pairs were discordant (both twin
members having different characteristics).
Kranz (Rosenthal, 1970) 1n his 1936 study of twins and criminality found
66 per cent twins concordant among identical twins and 54 per cent among
fraternal twins. Christiansen (1968) in his study of 6,000 pairs born between
1880 and 1890 in Denmark found that with respect to criminal behaviour
identical twins were concordant 1n 66. 7 per cent cases as compared to 30.4 per
cent of the fraternal twins.
The criticism against explaining criminal behaviour 1n terms of inherited
factors 15 that the similarities of the behaviour of identical twins could be the
result of living in the same environment and be totally unrelated to heredity
Secondly, if heredity is the cause of crime, there should be no cases of identical
twins where one is a criminal and the other is not. On similar lines, the studies
of family lines (Iukes by Dugdale 1n 1877; Kallikaks by Goddard 1n 1911, etc
as evidence of inherited criminality have also been rejected.

<h1>
	Psycbogenic Explanation
</h1>
<p>
	The psychogenic theories trace crime in some defect 1n the personality of the
offender or ‘in the inside of the person’. The psychological theory emphasizes
feeblemindedness (low Intelligence Quotient or IQ), the psychiatric theory on
the mental disorders, and the psychoanalytical theory on the undeveloped
ego, or drives and instincts, or guilt-feelings or inferiority complex.

</p>
<h1>
	Psychological Explanation
</h1>
<p>
	Henry Goddard (1919: 8-9) reported results on intelligence tests in 1919 and
maintained that the greatest single cause of delinquency and crime is feeble-
mindedness (very low IQ). He said that feeblemindedness is inherited and is
very little affected by life events. He emphasized that a criminal is not born
but made. But Goddard did not believe that every feeble-minded person was a

<p>
     criminal. He may be a potential criminal but whether he becomes one would
be determined by two factors: his temperament and his environment. Thus,
though feeblemindedness may be hereditary, criminality is not hereditary.

In 1928—29, Sutherland Cressay (1965: 357-75) analysed 350 reports on
studies on intelligence tests covering little less than two lakh criminals and
delinquents to examine the relationship between crime and mental
deﬁc1enc1es They discovered that: (1) 50 per cent criminals were diagnosed as
feeble-minded 1n the studies conducted between 1910—14, but only about 20
per cent were found criminals 1n studies 1n the period 1925—28; (2) there was a
negligible difference in the mental age of criminals and non-criminals; (3) the
discipline among low-mentality prisoners was the same as among
high-mentality prisoners; and (4) conformity to parole conditions of the
feeble-minded and the ordinary parolees was almost equal. They, thus,
concluded that low mentality of the feeble-minded is not a significant cause of
criminality.
</p>

<h1>
	psycbiatric Explanation
</h1>

<p>
	William Healy, a psychiatrist in Chicago, disagreeing with his physician
colleagues that juvenile delinquency was caused by defective organisms or
anatomical factors emphasized on personality defects and disorders, or
'psychogenic traits’ as the cause of crime. In broader terms, psychogenic traits
cause those ways of behaviour which are established 1n the infant or the
young child through emotional interaction within the family. These traits
refer to  extroversion or introversion, dominance or submission, optimism or
pessimism, emotional independence or dependence, self-confidence or its
absence, egocentrism or sociocentrism, and so on (Johnson, 1978: 155). In
narrower terms, however, the term ‘psychogenic’ is referred to ‘mental
disorder' or ‘emotional disturbances. Analysing psychological factors Healy
found  a greater frequency of personality disorders among delinquents than
among non-delinquents.

 Psychiatrists have given three types of mental disorders or psychoses (that
is individuals manifesting severe decompression, distortion of reality and loss of
contact  with reality): (i) schizophrenia (exhibiting tendency to retreat from
reality through delusions and hallucinations), (ii) maniac-depressive disorder
(exhibiting ﬂuctuations 1n mood), and (iii) paranoia. The estimate is that only
1.5 cent to 2 per cent criminals are psychotic, of whom the schizophrenic 1s
the most common among such offenders.

A study of 10,000 felons in New York between 1932 and 1935 also
pointed  out that only 1.5 per cent were psychotic, 6. 9 per cent were
psycho-neurotic, 6. 9 per cent were psychopathic and 2. 4 per cent were
feeble-minded. Thus, 82. 3 per cent of offenders were diagnosed as ‘normal’.

</p>

<p>
	Another study of Paul Schilder (Ioumal of Criminal Psychopatholog, October,
1940: 152) in 1937 in New York pointed out that 83.8 per cent offenders were
‘normal’. Dunham’s (1939: 352—61) study of 500 males in Illinois hospital
showed that schizophrenia was a negligible factor in the causation of crime
Thus, all these investigations show that the psychiatric theory has proved
untenable (Bromberg and Thompson, 1939: 70-89).
Serious methodological errors have been pointed out in Healy's
researches too: (1) his samples are small and unrepresentative; (2) his terms are
either not defined or vaguely defined, for example, ‘normal emotional
control’ and ‘good living conditions’. How are these factors to be measured;
and (3) research fails to explain why some children who have the traits
believed to be characteristic of delinquents do not become delinquents and
why some children who do not have those traits do become delinquents. By
now, we might conclude that psychiatric theory stands rejected.
</p>
<h1>
	Psycho-analytical Explanation
</h1>
<p>
	Sigmund Freud, who developed the psycho-analytical theory at the end of the
nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, did not advance a
theory of criminality. But his approach and the three elements of Id, ego, and
super-ego have been used by others like Adler, Abrahamsen, Aichhorn  and
Friedlander to explain criminal behaviour. Id 18 an individual’ s raw instinct or
desire or drive or urge; ego is the reality; and super-ego is an individual’s
conscience or moral pressure. Super-ego constantly tries to suppress the Id
while the ego is the acceptable balance between the Id and the super-ego. The
Id and superego are basically unconscious while the ego is the conscious part
of the personality.
The three propositions of psychoanalytic thought are: (1) behaviour is
largely the product of unconscious psychological- biological forces (drives or
instincts); (2) criminality arises out of conflicts related to these basic drives;
and (3) to modify undesirable (criminal) behaviour, the person must be
guided towards insight into the unconscious roots of his responses so that he
can develop control over such impulses. In a well-balanced personality, Id,
ego and super-ego work in relative harmony. But in abnormal cases
(neurotic individuals), imbalance and disharmony occurs. When the
super-ego is not sufficiently developed, the released repressed instincts may
lead to anti-social behaviour. Conﬂict in the unconscious mind gives rise to
feelings of guilt with a consequent desire for punishment to remove the guilt
feelings and restore a balance of good against evil. The individual then
commits the criminal act, leaves clues for apprehension in order to be caught
and punished (V old, 1958: 93).
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000377">377</pagenum>


<h1>
	Page no:377
</h1>

<p>
	Aichhorn (1955: 30) was the first scholar to use Freud’s psychoanalytical
approach in studying delinquents. He found several kinds of delinquents:
some  neurotic, some aggressive and lacking in super-ego development, some
with little capacity for repressing their instinctual drives, and some having
distorted cravings for affection.
Alfred Adler explains crime in terms of ‘inferiority complex’. An
individual commits crime to ‘get attention’ which helps him to compensate
for his sense of inferiority. But Adler’s theory is criticized for placing greater
emphasis on the ‘rational’ side of an individual’ 3 behaviour and for oversim-
plification.
David Abrahamsen (1952) has explained crime in terms of an individ-
ual’s resistance to tendencies and situations. He developed a formula:

C=T+S/R
</p>
<p>
 where ‘C’ stands for crime, ‘T’ for tendencies, ‘S’ for situation, and ‘R’ for
resistance. Criminal behaviour will result if the individual has strong
criminalistic tendencies and low resistance.
 Sociologists have not favourably reacted either to Abrahamsen’s expla-
nation or to psychoanalytic explanation that causes of crimes are unconscious.
they say, it is an oversimplification to reduce causative factors to three factors
in mathematical terms. Likewise, the explanation that the criminal commits
crime because he subconsciously desires to be punished as a result of his guilt
feelings cannot be accepted for all crimes because in some cases, the individual
commits crime, feels guilty, and is then punished. Mannheim has also said that
punishment is no deterrent for the criminal. Thus, arguments against the
psychiatric theory are: (1) there is methodological and logic-of-science error in
psychiatric theory; (2) the terms are vague as no operational definitions of Id,
ego, super—ego or unconscious are given; (3) protective techniques are open to
subjective  interpretation of the analyst; (4) the researches are based on small
samples and inadequate control groups; (5) so long as an individual 15 the focus
of the  approach, generalizations cannot be made regarding patterns of
behaviour; and (6) this theory 1n fact does not explain anything 1n terms of the
causation of criminal behaviour.
</p>
<h1>
	Sociogenic Explanation
</h1>
<p>
	While the physiological, psychiatric and psychological theoretical explana-
tions emphasize that crime is either inherited and results from a physical or a
mental factor, or is the consequence of suppressed childhood experiences,
sociologists argue that criminal behaviour is learned and it is conditioned by

<p>
	the social environment. Sociologists have used two approaches 1n studying the
causation of crime. the first approach studies the relationship between crime
and the social structure of society; and the second approach studies the process
by which an individual becomes a criminal. Thus, sociological explanations
may be classified in two categories: (1) structural explanations which include
economic explanation, geographical explanation and sociological explanations
of Merton and Clifford Shaw and sub-culture explanations of Cohen and
Cloward and Ohlin, and (2) processual explanations which include explana-
tions of Sutherland, Howard Becker and Walter Reckless.
</p>
<h1>
	Economic Explanation
</h1>
<p>
	This explanation analyses criminal behaviour in terms of the economic condi-
tions in society. It holds that the criminal is a product of the economic
environment which provides him his ideals and his goals. It was the Italian
scholar Fornasari who talked of the relationship between crime and poverty
in 1884. He maintained that 60 per cent of the population of Italy is  poor, and
of the total crimes in Italy, 85 per cent to 90 per cent criminals belong to this
section of the poor. In 1916, a Dutch scholar Bonger also emphasized the
relationship between crime and the capitalistic economic structure. In a
capitalistic system, man concentrates only on himself and this leads to
selfishness. Man is interested only in producing for himself, specially in
producing a surplus which he can exchange for profit. He is  not interested in
the needs of others. Capitalism, thus, breeds social irresponsibility and leads to
crime.
</p>
<p>
	In 1938, a British criminologist Cyril Burt (1944. 147) analysing juvenile
delinquency found that 19 per cent juvenile delinquents belonged to
extremely poor families and 37 per cent to poor families. He concluded that
though poverty is an important factor in crime, it is not the only factor. In
1915, William Healy studied 675 juvenile delinquents and found that 5 per
cent belonged to the destitute class, 22 per cent to the poor class, 35 per cent to;
the normal class, 34 per cent to the comfort class, and 4 per cent to the luxury
class. Thus, since 73 per cent delinquents belonged to classes which are
economically normal or well— off, poverty cannot be considered to be a very
important factor 1n delinquency.
Karl Marx’s view of economic determinism advocated that private
ownership of property results in poverty which distinguishes those who own
the means of production from those whom they exploit for economic beneﬁt.
The latter turn to crime as a result of this poverty. Thus, though Marx did not
specifically develop a theory of criminal causation but he believed that the
economic system was the sole determinant of crime.

<p>
	In India, two studies may be referred to in this context. Ruttonshaw
1947: 49) studied 225 juvenile delinquents in Poona and found that 20 per
cent belonged to families whose income was less than Rs 150 per month, 5 per
cent belonged to families with an income of Rs 150—500 per month, 12. 2 per
cent belonged to families with an income of Rs 500—1, 000 per month, 4. 8 per
cent belonged to families with an income of Rs 1, 000—2, 000 per month, and
27 per cent belonged to families whose 1ncome was more than Rs 2, 000 per
month. This study, thus, shows that poverty cannot be given excessive impor-
tance  in crime. Sutherland and Cressay (1965) have also said that: (1) we find
more criminals in poor families because it is easy to locate them, (2) criminals
belonging to upper classes use their inﬂuence and pressures in escaping arrests
and convictions, and (3) reactions of administrators are biased in favour of the
upper class people. Thus, today, most behavioural scientists reject the theory
of economic determinism in criminal behaviour.
</p>
<h1>
	Geograpbical Explanation
</h1>
<p>
This explanation evaluates crime on the basis of geographical factors like
climate, temperature and humidity. It is supported by scholars like Quetlet,
Dexter, Montesquiu, Kropotokin, Champneuf and many others. According to
Quetlet, crimes against persons predominate 1n south and increase in summers,
while  crimes against property predominate in north and increase in winters.
Champneuf supported this hypothesis of relationship between the nature of
crime and the climate on the basis of his study conducted in France between
1825 and 1830. He found 181. 5 property crimes against every 100 crimes against
persons in north France, and 98.8 property crimes against every 100 crimes
against persons in south France. On the basis of his study of property crimes
conducted between 1825 and 1880, the French scholar Laccasagne also found
the highest number of property crimes in December, followed by January,
November and February. In the study on the effect of weather on an individ-
ual's behaviour made in 1904, the American scholar Dexter found that crime
and geographical environment are highly related with each other. In 1911, a
Russian scholar Kropotkin established that the rate of murder in any
month/year can be predicted by calculating the average temperature and
humidity  of the preceding month/ year For this, he gave a mathematical
formula 2(7x+y), where‘ x’ is temperature and‘y ’is humidity. Multiplying the
average temperature ‘x’ of last month with 7 and adding the average humidity
of the last month ‘y’ to it, if we multiply the total figure with 2, we will get the
number of murders to be committed in the given month.
The geographical explanation has been criticized on the ground that
geographical factors may affect individual behaviour but the direct

	relationship between crime and geographical factors cannot be accepted as
given by the scholars. Had such relationship existed, the number and nature
of crime in a given geographical environment would have been the same at all
times, which is not so. Hence, the invalidity of this theory.

<h1>
	Sociological Explanations
</h1>

<h1>
	Sutherland’s Theory of Differential Association
</h1>
<p>
		E. H. Sutherland propounded the Differential Association Theory in 1939. He
says, two explanations have mainly been forwarded for criminal behaviour
situational and genetic or historical. The former explains crime on the basis of
situation that persists at the time of crime, and the latter explains crime on the
basis of a criminal’s life experiences. He himself used the second approach in
developing the theory of criminal behaviour. Suppose a hungry boy comes
across a shop and finds the shopkeeper absent. He steals a loaf of bread. In this
case, it is not because the shopkeeper was absent and he was hungry that the
boy committed the theft but it is because he had learnt earlier that one can
satisfy his hunger by stealing things. Thus, it is not the situation which
motivates a person to commit theft, it is his learnt attitudes and beliefs.
Sutherland’ 3 main thesis 15 that individuals encounter many inharmo-
nious and 1nconsistent social inﬂuences 1n their life-time and many individuals
become involved in contacts with carriers of criminalistic norms, and as a
consequence become criminals. He called this process ‘differential association
(Sutherland and Cressay, 1965: 77—79).
</p>
<p>
	The theory states that criminal behaviour is learnt in a process of
communication with other persons, principally in small, intimate groups
This learning includes the techniques of committing the crime. The specific
direction of motives, drives, rationalizations and attitudes is learned from
definitions of the legal codes as favourable or unfavourable. A person becomes
criminal or delinquent because of an excess of definitions favourable to
violation of law over definitions unfavourable to violation of law. This is the
principle of differential association. Differential associations may vary in
frequency, duration, priority and 1ntensity. The process of learning criminal
behaviour by associations with criminal and anti-criminal patterns involves all
of the mechanisms that are involved in any other learning. While criminal
behaviour is an expression of general needs and values, it is not explained by
those needs and values since non-criminal behaviour is an expression of the
same needs and values.
</p>
<p>
	Sutherland’ s theory was supported by James Short Junior on the basis of
his study of 176 school children (126 boys and 50 girls) 1n 1955 (Giallombardo,
</p>

<p>
	1966 85—91). Short measured the degree of. presumed exposure to crime and
delinquency in the community, the frequency, duration, priority and
intensity of interaction with delinquent peers and knowledge of and associ-
ation with adult criminals.
</p>
<p>
	But Sutherland’s theory has been attacked by many scholars like
Sheldon Glueck, Mabel Elliott, Caldwell, Donald Cressey, Tappan, George
Vold, Herbert Bloch, Jeffery Clarence, Daniel Glaser and others. The major
Criticism is that it is difficult to empirically test the principles and measure
'associations’ and the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of relation-
ships. According to Tappan, Sutherland has ignored the role of personality or
role of biological and psychological factors in crime. Vold (1958: 194) has
maintained that he has ignored the role of secondary contact and formal
groups in criminality. Clarence Ray Jeffery holds that Sutherland’s theory
fails to explain the origin of criminality, since criminality has to exist before it
can be learnt from someone else. Johnson (1978: 158). Elliot (1952: 402) says,
sutherland’s theory explains the systematic crimes but not the situational
ones. According to Cressey, Sutherland does not fully explore the implica-
tions of the learning process itself as it affects different individuals. Bloch
(1956: 158) is of the opinion that it is virtually impossible to measure associa-
tions in comparative quantitative terms. Glueck (1951: 309) maintains that an
individual does not learn every behaviour from others; many acts are learnt
naturally. Caldwell (1956) says that individuals become what they are largely
because of the contacts they have but both the constitutional or inborn hered-
itary structure and the intensity of the environmental stimuli must be
appraised as well. Daniel Glaser (1956: 194) modified Sutherland’s theory a
little to explain from whom an individual learns crime. He called this new
theory as ‘Differential Identification Theory’ and said that a person pursues
criminal behaviour to the extent that he identifies himself with real or
imaginary persons from whose perspective, his criminal behaviour seems
acceptable He further says that one of the persistent problems in the Theory
of differential Association is the obvious fact that not everyone in contact
with criminality adopts or follows the criminal pattern. What, therefore, is
the difference in the nature or quality of the association that in one case leads
to acceptance of the attitudes and behaviour of a group of one individual but
in the  case of another individual leads only to acquaintance with but not an
acceptance of the behaviour characteristics of the group.

<p>
	behaviour in 1938 in a paper published in the American Sociological Review. He
elaborated his thesis further in 1949 and 1957 and distinguished between social
and cultural structures. Cultural structure, according to him, refers to goals and
interests men pursue, while social structure refers to means or approved
methods which regulate and control the pursuit of goals and interests. The
cultural system of society enjoins all men to strive for goals by means of norma-
tively regulated or approved forms of behaviour. However, opportunities to
reach these goals through socially approved means are unequally distributed.
Deviant behaviour ensues when social structure restricts or completely closes a
person’s access to the approved modes of reaching these goals. In other words,
the disjunction between goals and means causes strains which in turn leads to a
weakening of men’s commitment to the culturally prescribed goals or institu-
tionalized means, that is, to a state of anomie. Thus, Merton’s thesis is that some
social structures exert a definite pressure on some persons to engage in
non—conformist rather than conformist conduct.
</p>
<p>
	MertOn (ibid.: 192-93) has identified five modes of adaptation available to
those who react to goals and means of society: conformity, innovation,
ritualism, retreatism and rebellion. Conformity describes the acceptance of
goals and also of the means of the society. Innovation represents the acceptance
of the goals but the rejection of the means. For example, a student accepts the
goal of passing the examination and obtaining a degree but uses unfair means to
pass. Thus, Merton points out that poverty does not cause crime but when
poverty is linked with a cultural emphasis on monetary success as a dominant
goal and a poor individual cannot compete, because of his poverty, for the
cultural values, then criminal behaviour is the normal outcome. Ritualism is the
rejection of the goals but acceptance of the means. For example, a student goes
to college but does not attend his classes and spends time instead in the college
canteen. Retreatism involves the rejection of both goals and means. For
example, when an individual fails to achieve his goals by legitimate means and at
the same time cannot adopt illegitimate means because of his prior socialization,
he rejects both goals and means and becomes a drunkard, drug addict or a
vagrant rebellion 15 characterized by the rejection of the goals and the means
and an attempt to adopt new goals and means.
</p>

	Merton’s theory has been criticized by Cohen, Clinard and Lemert.
Their main arguments are: (1) Merton’ s theory 18 incomplete because he has
not explained who will reject the goals and who will reject the means; (2) only
structure has been given importance; an individual’s personality has been
ignored; (3) strains do not necessarily lead to deviant behaviour; (4) the theory
neglects the important role of social control; (5) Merton’s assumption that
deviant behaviour is disproportionately more common in lower classes is not

Correct; (6) anomie may be the cause rather than the effect of circumscribed
life chances; (7) Cohen has argued that Merton has not explained the determi-
nants of the mode of adaptation of an individual; (8) Cohen has also said that
Merton has failed to account for the ‘non-utilitarian’ crime and juvenile delin-
quency in which people engage only for fun and not to meet specific goals of
the society; for example, vandalism or a car-theft for joy-rides; and (9) finally,
the theory does not take into account the social-psychological variables or the
social structural elements which might explain the priority of one adaptation
over the other by the individuals.

<h1>
Cloward and Oblin’s Theory of Differential  Opportunity
</h1>

<p>
	Cloward and Ohlin (1960) integrated Sutherland’s and Merton’s theories and
developed a new theory of criminal behaviour in 1960. Whereas Sutherland
talks of illegitimate means and Merton talks of differentials in legitimate
means, Cloward and Ohlin talk of differentials in both legitimate and illegit-
imate  means to success-goals. The important elements of this theory are: (1) an
individual occupies a position in both the legitimate and illegitimate oppor-
tunity structures, (2) relative availability of illegitimate opportunities affects
the resolution of an individual’s adjustment problems, and (3) faced with
limitations on legitimate avenues of accessibility to goals and unable to revise
his aspirations downward, he experiences intense frustration, resulting in
exploration of non—conformist alternatives.
</p>
<p>
schrag (1972: 167) systematically organized Cloward’s theory and gave
its four postulates: (1) middle-class goals, specially economic goals, are
widespread, (2) every organized community provides legitimate opportunities
for attaining these goals, (3) access to legitimate means varies from class to
class, and  (4) within given community, illegitimate opportunities may or may
not be available. But Schrag himself has criticized the theory of Cloward and
Ohlin based on the above postulates on two counts: (1) the theory fails to
explain why a young person who belongs to a lower class does not become
involved in the activities of delinquent gangs, and (2) who will use illegitimate
means to achieve the goals? Schrag has answered the second question himself.
He says that three types of persons are susceptible to indulging in deviant
behaviour join delinquent gangs: (1) those who blame the system for their
failures and/or adjustment problems, (2) those who think, they possess the
official criteria but not the pragmatic criteria, and (3) those who are alienated
from conventional norms or a legitimate system.
</p>
<p>
	Cloward and Ohlin have identified three types of delinquent
sub-cultures: the criminal, the conﬂictory, and the retreatist. The first empha-
sizes orderly activity oriented to economic gain; the second emphasizes

<p>
	violence and gun-fighting; and the third emphasizes drug use and other
‘kicks’. The first tends to arise in areas where successful and big-time criminals
reside and they have a high status in the conventional community and
mutually acceptable relations with political machines and law enforcement
officials. This sub-culture does not manifest violence. The second is found in
areas where there 18 no alliance between the criminal and the conventional
elements. This subculture features violence and/ or threat of violence as a
method of getting status. In such neighbourhoods, young people tend to
organize themselves in a community of gangs contending with one another
for ‘rep’ through the show of violence and toughness. The third is found in
areas where either repressive police measures make street-fighting too
dangerous or where moral and other inhibitions against the use of violence
exist. Individuals denied access to criminal and conflictive opportunities tend
to withdraw into a world of narcotic drugs.
</p>
<p>
	Short, Tennyson and Rivers have supported Cloward and Ohlin's
theory on the basis of their study on the perception of legitimate and illegit-
imate opportunities pertaining to education and occupation among 500
Negro and white lower-class gang boys and middle—class non-gang boys from
the same neighbourhood. Walter Reckless also undertook a project to
examine Cloward’s theory. Some of the questions pertaining to the
perception of opportunities were. (1) 1 probably won’t be able to do the kind
of work that I want to do because I don’t have enough education, (2) if a kid
like me works hard, he can get a lead, (3) my family can’t give me the oppor-
tunity that most kids have, (4) most people are better off than I am, (5) I am as
well off as most people are, and (6) a guy like me has a pretty chance of going
to a college.

</p>
<p>
	On the basis of the responses received, Reckless found that Cloward's
theory is partly correct, that is, it explains some crimes but not all crimes.
The important criticisms against Cloward and Ohlin’s theory are: (1) the
main contention in the theory that there are two kinds of opportu-
nities—legitimate and illegitimate—is not so simple as it seems. The
distinction, although real, is ‘analytical’ rather than ‘concrete’, that is, there
are not some things that are legitimate opportunities and other things that are
illegitimate opportunities, but the same things are always both; for example,
notes prepared by students on small pieces of paper can be used as unfair
means in examinations as well as legitimate simple means for remembering
points a day or two before the examinations Similarly, a gun can be used for
killing as well as defending oneself; (2) Cloward and Ohlin maintain that the
lower-class youths have two orientations: (a) orientation toward membership
in middle-class, called ‘lifestyle’ orientation, and (b) orientation toward

</p>

<p>
	economic improvement, called ‘economic’ orientation. Cloward's thesis is
that candidates for delinquent subculture are those who wish to retain
lower— class membership but aspire to improve their economic status
Johnson, 1978: 179). But Gordon says, these two orientations do not exist
separately; (3) Cloward has not specified the initial conditions for the
emergence of various types of sub-culture; (4) there is class- bias in this theory;
(5) some concepts cannot be operationalized; for example, opportunity
structure, perception of opportunity, denial of legitimacy or double failure;
and (6) the personality factor has been completely ignored.

<h1>
	Coben’s Theory of Value Orientation or Delinquent Sub-culture
</h1>
<p>
	Albert Cohen’s (1955: 65-66) theory mainly deals with the problems of status
adjustment of Working-class boys. Cohen holds that the young people’s
feelings of themselves depend largely upon how they are judged by others.
The situations in which they are judged, most notably the school situation,
are largely dominated by middle class values and standards, which in fact is the
dominant value system. These standards include such criteria as neatness,
polished manners, academic intelligence, verbal ﬂuency, high level of aspira-
tions, and a drive for achievement. Young people of different origins and
backgrounds tend to be judged by the same standards in the society, so that
young people of lower classes find themselves competing for status and
approval under the same set of rules. However, they are not equally well
equipped  for success in this status game. For this and other reasons, the
Lower-class children are more likely to experience failure and humiliation.
one way they can deal with this problem is to repudiate and withdraw from
the game and refuse to recognize that these rules have any application to
them But, this is not quite that simple because the dominant value system is
also, to  a degree, their value system. They have three alternatives before them:
(i) to adopt the ‘college—boy response’ of upward mobility (thrifty, hardwork,
cut himself from the activities of peers), (ii) to adopt the ‘stable corner-boy
response' (does not surrender the upward mobility idea but is neither thrifty
nor cuts himself from peers nor incurs hostility of either middle—class persons
or delinquent boys), and (iii) to adopt ‘delinquent response’ (completely
repudiates middle-class standards). Of these alternatives, most of the children
adopt the third response. They resort to reaction formation. They reject the
dominant value system and develop new values which are non-utilitarian
(because they do not benefit economically), malicious (because they enjoy at
other's cost and suffering), and negativistic (because they are opposed to the
accepted values of the larger society.

<p>
	The propositions in Cohen’s theory may be stated brieﬂy as follows
(Kitsuse and Dietrick, 1966: 20): The working-class boy faces a characteristic
problem of adjustment which is qualitatively different from that of the
middle-class boy. His problem is one. of ‘status frustration’. His socialization
handicaps him for achievement in the middle-class status system. Never
theless, he is thrust into this competitive system where achievement is judged
by middle-class standards of behaviour and performance. Ill-prepared and
poorly motivated, he is frustrated in his status aspirations by the agents of
middle-class society. The delinquent sub-culture represents a solution to the
working-class boy’s problem, for it enables him to ‘break clean’ With the
middle-class morality and legitimizes hostility and aggression without moral
inhibitions. Thus, the delinquent sub-culture is characterized by
non-utilitarian, malicious and negativistic values as an attack on the
middle-class where their egos are most vulnerable. It expresses contempt for a
way of life by making its opposite a criterion of status.
</p>

<p>
	Cohen’s above theory has been critically examined both as a theory of
the delinquent sub-culture and as a theory of delinquency. Sykes and Matza,
Merton, Reiss and Rhodes, Kobrin and Finestone, Kitsuse and Dietrick and
Wilensky and Labeaux have questioned various propositions and implications
of his thesis. The main criticisms are: (1) a gang member does not reject
middle-class values and standards but adopts techniques of neutralizati to
rationalize his delinquent behaviour (Sykes and Matza, 1957); (2) if Cohen's
theory 15 accepted, the delinquency rate of lower-class boys should be higher
in areas where they are in direct competition with middle-class boys and 1
rate should be lowest 1n areas where lower-class 1s universal. But Reiss and
Rhodes (1961) found that the more the lower-class boy was in minority in
school and 1n his residential areas, the less likely was he to become a delin-
quent; (3) Kitsues and Dietrick have challenged Cohen’s statement that the
working-class boy measures himself by middle-class norms; (4) his description
of delinquent sub-culture as non-utilitarian, malicious and negativistic is
inaccurate; (5) Cohen’s description of the working-class boy’s ambivalence
toward the middle-class system does not warrant the use of the‘ reaction
formation’ concept; (6) the methodological basis of the theory renders it
inherently untestable; and7 (7 ) the theory is ambiguous concerning the relation
between the emergence of the sub-culture and 1ts maintenance.

	Becker’s Labelling Theory
</h1>
<p>
	Howard Becker (1966) propounded his theory 1n 1963. Before him, Frank
Tennenbaum (1938), Edwin Lemert (1951), John Kitsuse (1962) and k.
Erikson (1962) had also used an approach called the ‘Social Reaction

<p>
	1y as approach’ or the ‘Social Interaction Approach’ as different from the ‘Struc-
Chara ‘ Approach’ used by Merton, or the ‘Cultural Approach’ used by Cohen
that Cloward and Ohlin. This theory does not deal with the question as to
Soci a person becomes a criminal but tells why the society labels some people
term Animals or deviants. Some ,men who drink heavily are called alcoholics
int others are not; some men who behave oddly are committed to hospitals
“epar  others are not. Thus, according to this theory, what is important in the
le 3g “ of deviance is the social audience, not the individual person. Becker also
tion’ obtained that what is important in crime is not the act of an individual but
 reaction of society in terms of rules and sanctions. Erikson has also said
lout what distinguishes a delinquent from a non-delinquent is not the charac-
realistic found in him but the characteristic assigned to him by others.
according to Becker (1966: 9), deviance is not a quality of the act a person
ammits but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and
ions to an ‘offender’. The deviant is one to whom that label has success-
th, been applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label. An
[d , Ient was performed in the United States (Reid, 1976: 232) in which
tri ’ t sane persons of varied backgrounds got themselves admitted for feigned
.ﬁ . Ital illness to psychiatric wards of 12 hospitals in various parts of the
ot ‘IItry. All gave the same account of their life situations. All but one were
atiI :4 ed Schizophrenic. Once labelled insane, they were presumed insane by
.f Staff who interacted with them daily. This shows that it is the reaction of
i which labels an individual in a specific way. In the case of criminals
itis the society which brands some people but not others as criminals. If
' . r-class boy steals a car, he is branded a ‘thief’, but if an upper-class boy
' so, he is described as a ‘mischievous pleasure-seeker’.
</p>
<p>
	In another experiment conducted by Richard Schwartz and Jerome
skolnick in 1962 in the USA, one person with a criminal record was intro-
duced to 100 potential employers with four different versions—he was found a
criminal and convicted; he was not found a criminal and acquitted; he was
found a criminal but acquitted; he was not a criminal but was convicted. It
was found that employers would not offer a job to a person with a criminal
record. Thus, the labeling theory shifted the focus to those who label, that is,
the process of rule-making and rule enforcement.
</p>
<p>
	According to Becker, whether or not labeling occurs depends upon (1)
the time when the act is committed, (2) who commits the act and who 18 the
victim, and (3) the consequences of the act. Thus, whether a given act is
deviant or not depends in part on the nature of the act and 1n part on what
other people do about it. Becker suggests that a distinction be made between
rule-breaking  behavior and deviance. Deviance is not a quality that lies in the

<p>
	behavior itself, but in the interaction between the person who commits an
act and those who respond to it. Becker has also suggested that certain types of
groups are more likely to be labelled deviant than others; for example, groups
that do not have political power and, therefore, cannot put pressure on the
officials for not enforcing the law, groups which are seen to threaten the
persons in power, and groups which have low social status.
</p>
<p>
	What are the effects on the individual who is labelled. The official
response to the behaviour in question may initiate processes that push the
‘delinquent’ individuals towards further delinquent conduct, and at least
make it more difficult for them to re-enter the conventional world. If on the
other hand, an individual does not receive official response to his delinquent
acts, he may continue committing them while receiving no help in changing
his behaviour (Wheeler and Cottrell, 1966: 22—27).
</p>
<p>
	Criticism against the labelling theory is that it gives a good logic but does
not explain the cause of crime. It entirely avoids the question of causation
Jack Gibbs (1982: 219) has posed four questions: What elements in the scheme
are intended to be definitions rather than substantive theory? Is the ultimate
goal to explain deviant behaviour or to explain reactions to deviation? Is
deviant behaviour to be identified exclusively in terms of the reaction to it?
Exactly, what kind of reaction identifies behaviour as deviant?
</p>
<h1>
	Reckless’ Theory of Self-Concept and Containment
</h1>
<p>
	Walter Reckless (1967: 522) has said that the important question that must be
answered in explaining criminal behaviour is why, given the alternatives of
law-abiding and law-violating behaviour, do some people turn to one or the
other behaviour. He advocates that self concept is the key factor in explaining
the choice among alternatives of behaviour. A favourable self-concept directs
an individual toward law-abiding behaviour, and an unfavourable self-concept
directs him towards delinquent behaviour. Reckless has further said that there
are two important aspects of control: inner control and outer control, and
that depending upon the balance of these control systems, the individual can
take either a deviant or a conformist route. His assumption is that strong
inner and reinforcing outer containment constitutes an isolation against
normative deviancy, that is, violation of the socio—legal conduct norms.
</p>
<p>
	In 1955, Reckless and Dinitz studied white ‘good’ boys (who, their
teachers thought, would not get into trouble with the law) of sixth grade of
about 12 years age, selected from high delinquency areas. The schedule
administered in the boys’ homes, contained 50 items designed to measure
self-concept. Likewise in 1956, they interviewed 101 ‘bad’ boys (who, their
teachers thought, would become delinquents) and studied their self-concept.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000389">389</pagenum>


<h1>
	Page no:389
</h1>

<p>
	They concluded, on the basis of this study, that a good self—concept is an
evidence of favourable socialization and the development of a ‘strong inner
self (self—control, well-developed super-ego, high frustration tolerance, resis-
tance to diversions, ability to find substitute satisfactions and tension-reducing
rationalizations) which directs a person towards middle-class values. Poor-self
concept is indicative of unfavourable socialization and ‘Weak inner direction,’
which in turn does not deﬂect the boy from bad companions and street corner
society, does not enable him to embrace middle-class values, and gives him an
awareness of being cut off from the upward movement in the legitimate
opportunity system.
</p>
<p>
	The evaluation of this theory has pointed out that though this is the
only research by sociologists in the area of delinquency which handles
variables of personality and self, nevertheless the measure of self concept has
been questioned and the lack of control groups noted. The samples have also
31 questioned. Was the selection of ‘good’ boys related to their perfor-
mance in schools? What about boys with ‘bad’ self concepts who might not be
delinquents?

conf1nement and Correction of Criminals

<p>
Two methods are mainly used in our soc1ety in punishing/treating the
criminals: imprisonment and release on probation, though some serious
offenders are given capital punishment, and fines are imposed on some minor
offenders.

	Prisons
</h1>
<p>
The	 conditions in Indian jails were horrible up to 1919—20. It was after the
recommendations of 1919—20 Indian Jails Reform Committee that changes like
classification, segregation of prisoners, education, recreation, assigning
productive work and opportunities for maintaining contacts with family and
society  were introduced in maximum security prisons (that is, central jails,
district jails and sub-jails). Later on, three medium security jails or model jails
were also established 1n three states with an emphasis on Panchayati Raj,
self-managed canteens and the wage system, but these jails were ultimately
converted into central jails. Minimum security prisons or open jails were started
in  Uttar Pradesh m 1952 and since then 24 open jails have come to be estab-
lished in 12 (out of 25) states till 1995. At present, the open jail system has been
working successfully in India. Some 28 prisons in the country follow the
system and most states have at least one of them. Prisoners have to fulﬁl certain
conditions before being admitted to an open jail, like spending one-third term
of imprisonment in an ordinary jail, having a record of good behaviour,

	possessing physical and mental ﬁtness, and being in the age group of 20 to 50
years. The capacity of open jails varies from 100 to 3,000; the highest capacity
(3,000) being found in Sitarganj Camp in Nainital district in Uttar Pradesh and
the lowest (less than 100) in Tamil Nadu, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat
Open Jails. Some open jails provide training only in agriculture, some only in
industries and some both in agriculture and industries. The average stay of a
prisoner in an open jail varies from two to three years.
</p>
<p>
	As regards the maximum security prisons, as of 31 December 2011, there
were 1,382 functioning prisons in India with a total capacity of 3,32,782
prisoners (NCRB Snapshots-2011). Of these 123 were central jails, 333 were
district jails, 809 were sub-jails and 30 were special jails. The total number of
jail 1nmates were 3, 72, 926, of which 95. 7 per cent (i. e., 3, 56 9,02) were males
and only 4. 3 per cent (i. e., 16,024) were females. The highest number of
inmates, i.e., 82,383 (or 22.1%) were from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Madhya
Pradesh (32, 916) and Bihar (28,032). Lakshadweep was the highest
overcrowding (500%). In all, 383 women convicts and 1, 177 undertrials were
in prisons. The maximum number (40.1%) of undertrials were detained for up
to three months. Of 1, 28, 592 convicted inmates majority were of either illit-
erates (37, 912) or below tenth standard (57,098). A total of 1, 332 deaths (1,244
natural and 88 unnatural) were reported during the year 2011. While 36 per
cent convicted prisoners were in the age group 18—30 years, 47.6 per cent were
in the age group 30—50 years and 16.4 per cent in 50 years or more. Besides
about 43, 317 inmates were trained in various skills like tailoring, carpentry
agriculture etc.
</p>
<p>
	A prison is a unisex world where every inmate is stigmatized and has to
carry on tightly scheduled activities in the company of strangers. The inmates
are deprived of liberty, privileges, emotional security, and hetero-sexual
relations. To face these psychological and social problems, inmates follow the
‘inmate code’ of the ‘inmate system’ which is just contrary to the formal code
of the prison system. Some examples of the inmate code/ norms are: do not
work hard, do not cooperate with the officials, do not quarrel/argue with
other inmates, do not reveal secrets to officials, always keep on expressing
dissatisfaction with food, clothes, work, and so forth. Donald Clemmer has
described the internalization of these values and norms as the process of
prisonization’. His contention is that every prisoner is prisoner is prisonized;
prisonization takes place in stages, the degree of prisonization could be low
medium or high; prisonization depends upon factors like age, term of impris-
onment, nature of crime, relations with outside world, cell 1nmates and Work
colleagues; and the length of time served in jail. The prisonized mmate could
be deprisonized as well as reprisonized. Studying the effects and the

<p>
	 effectiveness of the prison system on the basis of an empirical study of 252
prisoners in three central jails in Rajasthan in 1977—78 (Ahuja, 1981), it was
found that though the process of prisonization was found in Indian jails too,
but every prisoner was not prisonized as claimed by Clemmer. Studying
conformity to pr1son/1nmate norms on the basis of three factors, namely,
contact with inmates/offlc1als, identification with staff/ inmates norms, and
loyalty to inmates/ officials, it was found that 24 per cent inmates were
conformists (who identified with prison norms, were bound by loyalty to
staff and had great contacts with prison officials), 42 per cent were
non-conformists, 27 per cent were partial conformists and 7 per cent were
isolationists. Further, analysing the absorption of inmate/ prison norms by
assigning scores to answers of 15 questions, it was found that 48 per cent
inmates conformed to inmate norms, 45 per cent to prison norms and 7 per
cent were neutral. This shows that the rate of absorbing inmate norms is
about the same as that of absorbing prison norms and most of the inmates
remained in an ambiguous position in accepting or rejecting prison/ inmate
norms. It was also found that prisonization was not related to age, nature of
offence, term of imprisonment, and the phase of imprisonment as claimed by
Clemmer. However, it was related with the type of inmates with whom a
prisoner lives/ works. Thus, rejecting Clemmer’s model, a new model was
developed, called ‘Self Image Model’, for explaining the process of adjustment
of inmates in a jail. This model is based on four elements: self-image, value
conformity, actual conformity and prisoners’ prestige.
</p>
<p>
	On the basis of this study of three prisons, it is maintained that a balanced
policy of liberalization and strictness regarding the inmates in the prison should
be adopted for punishing/ treating the offenders through imprisonment. Other
measures needed to make the prison system more effective and m correcting the
deviants are: undertrials should not be kept with convicts in the same prison;
inmates should be provided access to their ﬁles; there should be proper
diagnosis before assigning barrack/ work to the prisoners; inmates should be
given freedom of choosing the work of their choice; release on parole should be
made easier and more effective; private industries should be encouraged to come
to prisons; effective channels should be provided to the inmates for expressing
their grievances; a system of indeterminate sentence should be introduced;
sending offenders to prison for a short term (less than six months) should be
discouraged (at present 85% of our prisoners are short-termers); a Bureau of
prison industries should be established at the state level, and the prisoners
should  associated with the management of prisons through the AdVisory
committees  (this system will be different from the Panchayati Raj system in
prisons). knowing that there is no connection between the severity of prison

	conditions and incidence of crime, why should we not try to devise
programmes which may induce prisoners to turn over a new leaf? what we
need today 18 an alternative to a prison.
</p>
<h1>
	Probation
</h1>
<p>
	Probation is an alternative to a prison. It is suspension of sentence of an
offender by the court and releasing him on certain conditions to live in the
community with or without the supervision of a probation officer. The
system was introduced in India in 1958 by passing the Probation of Offenders
Act. Though Section 562 in .1898 CrPC permitted release of an offenders on
probation but it applied only to juvenile delinquents and first offenders. There
was no provision for supervision and only first class magistrates were
empowered to grant probation. The British government permitted states
(provincial governments) in 1934 to enact their own laws permitting
probational release. Madras and Madhya Pradesh enacted such an Act in 1936,
Bombay and Uttar Pradesh in 1938, Hyderabad in 1953 and West Bengal in
1954. But all these Acts were meant only for the probational release of
juvenile delinquents. The 1958 Act applies to all offenders. It permits the
release on probation for a maximum period of three years and also has a
provision for revoking the term. Some states (like Rajasthan, Uttar pradesh,
Assam and Himachal Pradesh) have linked probation with social welfare and
others (like Bihar, West Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and
Kerala) with the Prison Department. Madhya Pradesh has linked it with the
Law Department, while Karnataka has its separate Directorate. The
probation officer has been assigned two functions: social investigation and
supervision of probationers. There are about 500 probation officers in the
country. On an average, one probation officer investigates 20 cases and super-
vises ten cases a year.
</p>
<p>
	The probation system has certain advantages over the prison system
These are: no stigma is attached to the offender released on probation; there is
no break in the probationer’s economic life; his family does not suffer; the
offender does not feel frustrated; and economically it is less expensive. The
disadvantages are that the offender is put in the same environment in Which
he committed the crime; there is no fear of punishment; and no individual
attention is paid to probationers. However, these criticisms are not logical .
Further, probation can be made more effective through new measures. These
could be: changing the concept of probation and treating it not as a suspension
of sentence but as an alternative to imprisonment (with this, the probationer
will not be imprisoned for the original offence for which his sentence was
suspended but will only be penalized for violating the conditions); making

	investigation compulsory in all those cases where the offender is
 on probation; not making supervision compulsory for all proba—
 making conditions for release ﬂexible; introducing indeterminate
system and, not linking probation services with any other
department but establishing a separate directorate for it at the state level.
Summarizing the problem of correction, it may be concluded that crimi-
Sociologists have always been tied to two explicit interests: first, the managerial
interest in making the correctional system more efficient and second, the
tarian interest in reforming the system. These two interests are often
considered incompatible but they might not be so when perceived in terms of
prehabilitative ethics’. Treatment can be seen both as more efficient and more
humanitarian.

<h1>
	Juvenile Delinquency
</h1>

<p>
	The notions about juvenile delinquency held by laymen and some law
enforcement officials are faulty and misleading. For one thing, they often
assume that juvenile delinquents are simply under-age criminals, that is,
non-adult criminals, or juveniles who engage in offences that constitute crimes
when committed by adults, and have not completed the age of 18 years, as
prescribed by the law of the land. The maximum age today for juvenile delin-
quents according to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act
of 2000 is 18 years. Earlier, in Juvenile Justice Act of 1986, the maximum age
for boys was 16 years and for girls 18 years. However, the nature of offence is
just the same.
</p>
<p>
	Youths who are involved in ‘status offences’ such as truancy, vagrancy,
immorality and ungovemability also fall within the definition of juvenile
delinquency. Neumayer, Ivan Nye and James Short Jr., Richard Jenkins and
Walter Reckless have also emphasized on the‘ type of behaviour’ in the
concept of juvenile delinquency. According to Reckless (1956), the term
juvenile delinquency’ applies to the “violation of criminal code and/ or
pursuit certain patterns of behaviour disapproved of for children and
young adolescents”. Thus, both age and behavioural infractions prohibited in
the statutes are important in the concept of juvenile delinquency.
</p>
<p>
	The difference between a delinquent child and an adult criminal is
important from the case-work approach. The difference between the two is
made by the conduct involved, the methods employed by the court, the
philosophy and methods applied in treatment, and the individuals’ status,
reputation and civil rights in the community after adjudication.

<h1>
	Classification of Juvenile Delinquents
</h1>
<p>
	Juvenile delinquents have been classified by different scholars on different
basis. For example, Hirsh (1937) has classified them in six groups on the basis
of the kinds of offences committed: (1) incorrigibilily (for example, keeping
late hours, disobedience, etc.), (2) truancy (staying away from school), (3)
larceny (ranging from petty theft to armed robbery), (4) destruction of property
(including both public and private property), (5) violence (against individual or
community by using weapons), and (6) sex oﬂences (ranging from homosexu-
ality to rape).
</p>
<p>
	Eaton and Polk (1969) have classified delinquents into five groups
according to the type of offence. The offences are: (1) minor violations
(including disorderly conduct and minor traffic Violations), (2) major viola-
tions (including automobile thefts), (3) property violations (4) addition
(including alcoholism and drug addiction), and (5) bodily harm (including
homicide and rape).
</p>
<p>
	Trojanowicz (1973: 59) has classified them as accidental, unsocialized,
aggressive, occasional, professional and gang-organized.
Psychologists have classified juvenile delinquents on the basis of these
individual traits or the psychological dynamics of their personality into five
groups: mentally defective, psychotic, neurotic, situational and cultural.
</p>
<h1>
	Nature and Incidence
</h1>
<p>
	Of the total delinquencies committed by the juveniles, hardly 2 per cent come
to the notice of the police and the courts. The statistics complied by the
National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), and published in Crimes in India,
2011, gives some indication of the incidence of juvenile delinquency in India.
The share of IPC crimes committed by juveniles to total IPC crimes
reported in the country during 1999 and 2000 was at 0.5 per cent. It may be
pertinent to mention that the figures for juvenile delinquency till 2000 were
collected as per the definition of juveniles in the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986
Male below the ageof 16 years and female below the age of 18 years were
considered as juveniles in this Act. The new Act of 2000 repealed the 1986 Act
according to which the age of juvenile males and females was brought at par as
below the age of 18 years.
</p>
<p>
	This share of crimes under IPC has increased to 0.9 per cent in 2001 and
further marginally increased to 1 per cent in 2002 but remained static in 2003
2004 and 2005. It again marginally increased to 1.1 per cent in 2006 and remained
static in 2007. In 2008, the share increased marginally to 1.2 per cent and
decreased to 1.1 per cent in 2009.This share further decreased to 1 per cent in 2010
and marginally increased to 1.1 per cent in 2011. The considerable increase in

<p>
	2001 may be partly attributed to increase in age of delinquent boys from 16 to 18
years as per the new deﬁnition of juveniles (Crime in India, 2011: 131).
 Similar pattern was observed in juvenile crime rate also. Juvenile crime
rate was 0.9 during 2000, whereas it has shown a mixed trend during
2000-2011. The details may be seen below in Table 1:

	The juvenile crimes under IPC 1n 2011 have increased by 10.5 per cent
over 2010 as 22,740 IPC crimes by juveniles were registered during 2010
which increased to 25,125 in 2011. The highest decrease in juvenile delin-
quency was observed under the crime heads‘ preparation and assembly for
dacoity' (35.3%), ‘death due to negligence’ (25. 6%) and ‘criminal breach of
trust'(14.0%) in 2011 over 2010 whereas the highest increase in the incidence
of juvenile crimes was observed under the heads c‘ounterfeiting’ (81.8%),
dowry deaths’ (63.2%), ‘arson’ (57.6%) and ‘kidnapping and abduction of
women and girls’ (53.5%).

together, have accounted for 69.6 per cent of total juvenile delinquency cases
under IPC reported in the country. Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh reported
145 and 112 cases of murder respectively during 2011. The highest incidences of
the juvenile rape cases in the country were reported from Madhya pradesh
(271), followed by Uttar Pradesh (146) and Maharashtra (125), which were 24.6
per cent, 13.3 per cent and 11.4 per cent of total juvenile rape cases respectively
in the country. The highest incidences of the juvenile theft in the country were
reported from Maharashtra (1,256, 25%) (ibid.: 132).
Juvenile delinquency under SLL crimes has increased by 10.9 per cent in
2011 as compared to 2010 as 2, 558 cases of juvenile delinquency under SLL
were reported in 2010 which increased to 2, 837 1n 2011, while there was
substantial decrease of 40.8 per cent in 2010 as compared to 2009. Cases under
Indian Passport Act and Forest Act have registered a sharp decline of 66.7 per
cent each, while cases under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and immoral
Traffic (Prevention) Act registered sharp 1ncrease of 200 and 50 per cent
respectively (see Table 2).

23.7 per cent of total juvenile crimes under SLL, followed by Chhattisgarh
(514 cases, 18.1%), Gujarat (464 cases, 16.4%), Maharashtra (296 cases, 10.4%)
and madhya Pradesh (276 cases, 9.7%). These five states, if taken together,
have accounted for 78.3 per cent of total juvenile delinquency cases under SLL
reported in the country. Out of 424 cases reported in the country under
Gambling Act against juveniles, 33 per cent cases were reported from Madhya
pradesh (140) followed by Chhattisgarh (123). Gujarat reported 215 (68. 7%)
cases under Prohibition Act, followed by Maharashtra 92 (29.4%) and both
states accounted for 98.1 per cent. A total of 46 cases out of 152 under Arms
Act were reported from Madhya Pradesh whereas 26 out of 46 cases reported
under the Foreigners Act were from West Bengal and 12 out of 19 cases regis-
tered under Essential Commodities Act were from Maharashtra. Seven out of
34 cases under Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)
Act were registered in Uttar Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh reported 65 cases out

under IPC crimes while 3,121 (9.3%) were arrested for committing SLL
crimes. The highest number of juveniles were arrested for theft (6,552).
followed by hurt (5, 016) and burglary (3, 334). These heads, if taken together,
accounted for 48. 4 per cent of total juveniles arrested under IPC crimes. Out
of total 3,121 juveniles arrested under SLL crimes during 2011, the highest
number were arrested under the Gambling Act (482), followed by Prohibition
Act (353) and Excise Act (206). These three heads under SLL crimes, if taken

Of the total of 33,887 juveniles who were arrested were produced before
various courts during 2011. The percentage of juveniles awaiting trial. at the
end of 2011 was 32.7 per cent (11,078 out of 33,887). Arunachal Pradesh and
Nagaland have reported 100 per cent disposal of juveniles arrested. While 11.9

<h1>
	Characteristics
</h1>

<h1>
	Following are some of the important characteristics of juvenile delinquency in
India:
</h1>
<p>
	1. The delinquency rates are much higher among boys than among girls,
that is, girls commit less delinquencies than boys. The involvement of
girls in the juvenile delinquency up to 1987 was about 6 per cent to 7 per
cent. This suddenly increased to 13.4 per cent in 1988 due to the change
in the definition of juveniles by which, girls in the age group of 16-18
years only, are considered as juveniles. If we take the figures pertaining
to the earlier years and work out the percentage of girls within the
newly deﬁned range of age, it comes to 13.1 per cent which compares
well with 13.4 per cent in 1988. Thus, the present figures (in 2011)
suggest an overall ratio of 19 boys for each girl for IPC crimes and 6 boys
for each girl for SLL crimes. In 2010, this ratio was 1:20 and 1:10 respec-
tively. Of the 33,887 juveniles apprehended under the IPC and SLL
crimes in 2011, the percentage of girls to total juveniles was only 5.8
(ibid.: 136).
2. The delinquency rates tend to be highest during early adolescence (12-16
years age group). Since the new definition of the age of juvenile delin-
quency in 1988, if we calculate the average of five years from 1989 to
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000401">401</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
	1994, about two-third delinquents (66.9%) fall in this age group of 12—16
years. Earlier (between 1978 and 1987), it was observed that a large
number of delinquents (71%) belonged to 18—21 years (late adolescence)
age group, 15 per cent belonged to 16-18 years age group, 9 per cent to
12-16 years age group, and 5 per cent to 7—12 years age group. Now, the
percentage share of two age groups has changed. About 21.5 per cent
belong to 7—12 years age group and 14.3 per cent to 16-18 years age
group. The share of 12—16 years age group has increased from 10 per cent
in 1978-87 to 64.3 per cent in 1994 because since 1988, 18-21 years age
group has entirely gone out of the ambit of the juvenile consideration. In
2011, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra reported significant number of
juveniles committed IPC crimes in the age groups 7—12, 12—16 and 16-18
years whereas juvenile offenders in SLL category in the age groups 7—12
and 12—16 were highest from Tamil Nadu (ibid.:136)
</p>
<p>
	Juvenile delinquency is more an urban than a rural phenomenon. The
metropolitan cities (with population of more than 10 lakh) produce
more juvenile delinquents than small cities and towns. Of these cities,
during 2011, Ernakulam has reported the highest incidence of IPC
crimes (34,638 cases), followed by Mumbai (32,647 cases), Bengaluru
(30,283 cases), Chennai (21,346 cases), Ahmedabad (20,203 cases) and
Indore (18,569 cases) (ibid.:35).
</p>
<p>
	Children living with parents and guardians are found to be more
involved in the juvenile crimes. At the time of arrest, in 2011, more than
three-fourths (81.3%) of the delinquents were found living with their
parents, whereas the share of homeless children was just 5.7 per cent.
This shows the role of family environment in juvenile delinquency.
</p>
<p>
Low educational background is the prime attribute for delinquency. In
2011, out of the total juveniles involved in various crimes, 6,122 were
illiterate and 12,803 had education up to primary level. These two
categories have accounted for 55.8 per cent of the total juveniles arrested
during the year (ibid.: 138). Thus, most delinquents come from illiterate
and less educated families.
</p>
<p>
	Poor economic background is another important characteristic of
juvenile delinquency in India. A large chunk of juveniles (56.7%) came
from poor homes with an income of less than Rs 25,000 per annum. The
share of juveniles from families with annual income between Rs 25,000
and Rs 50,000 was 26.7 per cent, whereas the share of juveniles hailing
from middle income group with annual income between Rs 50,000 and
Rs 2 lakh was 11.4 per cent. And, the share of juveniles from families in
upper-middle (Rs 2 to 3 lakh) and upper (above Rs 3 lakh) income
</p>

<p>
groups was low at 1.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively. This shows
that juvenile delinquency is more a lower class phenomenon. Almost all
studies conducted in our country on juvenile delinquency and its
relation to the socio—economic order show that those at the bottom
strata have been found to have the highest rates. The extent to Which this
is true varies under different conditions, but one general point that has
been made in almost all studies is that the. impact of socio-economic
status shows its effect most strongly the further one goes into the delin-
quency adjudication process.
7. More juvenile delinquents are first offenders and only a little more than
one-tenth are recidivists or past offenders.
8. Though some delinquencies are committed in groups, having adult
members also, the number of juvenile gangs having support of organized
adult criminals is not much in our country.
</p>
<h1>
	Lowering the Age of Juvenile Delinquent in India
</h1>
<p>
The recent arrest of a 16-year-old 1n Mumbai gang-rape and sentencing one of
the accused 1n Delhi gang-rape case, also a juvenile during the crime, to  just
three years in a juvenile centre, has once again sparked off an intense and
widespread debate in the country with regard to the lowering the age of
juvenile delinquents. As we stated at the outset, the maximum age for a
juvenile delinquent in our country as per the Juvenile Justice (Care  and
Protection of Children) Act, 2000, today, is 18 years, irrespective of gender
Earlier, in Juvenile Justice Act of 1986, for boys it was 16 years and for girls 18
years. Even, in states, it varied as per their laws. For example, in Uttar
Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, it was 18
years, whereas in states like Rajasthan, Assam and Karnataka, it was 16 years
for boys and 18 years for girls. In 2000, the new Act repealed the 1976 Act and
all state laws and made uniformity 1n this regard all over the country.
     If we see the data we will find that crimes by juveniles, especially rape
and abduction of women, have seen an exponential rise in the country in past
decade. While rapes by juveniles have recorded 143 per cent spurt, abduction
of women has jumped by 380 per cent. Not only this, the share of teens, aged
between 16 and 18 years, in juvenile crimes has steadily increased from 48.7
per cent in 2002 to 66.5 per cent in 2012.
</p>
<p>
	The issue of lowering the age of juveniles from 18 to 16 years was ﬁrst
came to the forefront last year (2012) when one of the accused in the Delhi
gang-rape case was found to be a juvenile of 17-year-old, just a few months shy
of maturity. According to the 2000 Act, a person below 18 years can be given
only a maximum of three years of punishment and that too in a reformatory.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000403">403</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:403
</h1>

<p>
The Government of India, in view of the public outrage, constituted a
committee to look into rape laws under the chairmanship of Justice J.S.
verma but unfortunately it made no such recommendation. Almost
body will agree that there is something wrong with a system that allows
someone who has raped and brutalized a girl, resulting in her death, to walk
free after just three years because he was a ‘juvenile’. All over the world, laws
distinguish between adults and juveniles but many countries do not make this
distinction absolute and rigid. They strike a balance by calibrating the age
below which a person is considered juvenile to the nature of the crime. For
those charged with heinous crimes like murder or rape, the age limits are
lower. One of the most well-known case was the torture and murder of
toddler James Bulger in Britain by two 10-year-olds in 1993. Despite their
young age the offenders Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were tried as
adults. So, in our country too, an individual must be tried for the severity of
the crime he 18 accused for and his age must not be kept 1n view.
Against the backdrop of all this, many sensible persons have raised their voice
in this regard because sentencing a person to such a mild punishment of just
three years in a children’s home will encourage other criminally-minded
youth also and this trend has already been set if we see the Mumbai’s
gang-rape incident.
</p>
<h1>
Types
</h1>
<p>
Delinquency exhibits a variety of styles of conduct or forms of behaviour.
Each of the patterns has its own social context, the causes that are alleged to
bring it about, and the forms of prevention or treatment most often suggested
as appropriate for the pattern in question. Howard Becker (1966: 226—38) has
referred to four types of delinquencies: (a) individual delinquency, (b)
group-supported delinquency, (c) organized delinquency, and (d) situational
delinquency.
</p>
<h1>
Individual Delinquency
</h1>
<p>
This refers to delinquency in which only one individual is involved in
committing a delinquent act and its cause is located within the individual
delinquent. Most of the explanations of this delinquent behaviour come from
psychiatrists. Their argument is that delinquency 18 caused by the psycho-
logical problems stemming primarily from defective/faulty/pathological
family interaction patterns. Researches of Healy and Bronner, Albert Bandura
and Richard Walters, Edwin Powers and Helen Witmer, and Henry Mcyer,
Edgar Borgatta are based on this approach. Healy and Bronner (1936)
compared delinquent youths with their non-delinquent siblings and analysed
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000404">404</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:404
</h1>

<p>
the differences between them. Their most important finding was that over 90
per cent of the delinquents compared to 13 per cent of their non-delinquest
siblings had unhappy home lives and felt discontented with their life circus-
stances. The nature of unhappiness differed: some felt rejected by parents and
others felt either inferior to or jealous of siblings or suffered from mental
conflict. They indulged in delinquency as a solution to these problems, as it
(delinquency) either brought attention from parents or provided support
from peers or reduced their guilt feelings. Later studies also identified
important aspects of family relations leading to delinquencies. Bandura and
Walters compared the aggressive actions of white delinquents with those of
non-delinquent boys with no clear sign of economic hardship. They found
that delinquents differed from non-delinquents a little in their relationship
with their mothers but more in their relationship with their fathers. Thus
father-son rather than mother-son relations seemed more crucial in delin-
quency, as delinquent boys could not internalize moral values because of the
absence of good role models 1n their fathers. In addition, their discipline was
also more harsh and stern.
</p>
<h1>
Group-supported Delinquency
</h1>
<p>
In this type, the delinquencies are committed 1n companionship with others
and the cause is located not in the personality of the individual or in the delin-
quent’ s family but 1n the culture of the individual’ 5 home and neighbourhood.
The studies of Thrasher (1936) and Shaw and McKay (1931) talk of this type
of delinquency. The main finding 1n understanding why the young became
delinquent was their association and companionship with others already
delinquent. This was later put very clearly by Sutherland, who developed the
theory of differential association. Unlike the psychogenic explanations, this
set of ideas focuses on what is learnt and who 1t is learnt from rather tan on
the problems that might produce a motivation to commit delinquencies.
</p>
<h1>
Organized Delinquency
</h1>
<p>
This type refers to delinquencies that are committed by developing formally
organized groups. These delinquencies were analysed in the United States in
the 19503 and the concept of ‘delinquent sub-culture’ was developed. This
concept refers to the set of values and norms that guide the behaviour of
group members, encourage the commission of delinquencies, award status on
the basis of such acts and specify typical relationships to persons who fall
outside the groupings governed by group norms. Cohen (1960) was the first
person to refer to this type of delinquency. He was followed by Cloward and
Ohlin (1960) and a few others.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000405">405</pagenum>


<h1>
	Page no:405
</h1>
<h1>
	Situational Delinquency
</h1>
<p>
The above mentioned three types of delinquencies have one thing in
common. In all of them, delinquency is viewed as having deep roots. In
individual delinquency (according to the psychogenic explanation), the roots
of delinquency lie primarily within the individual; in group-supported and
organized delinquencies (the sociogenic explanation) the roots (of delin-
quency) lie in the structure of the society with emphasis either on the
ecological areas where delinquency prevails or on the systematic way in, which
social structure places some individuals in a poor position to compete for
sucess. The situational delinquency provides a different perspective. Here the
assumption is that delinquency is not deeply rooted, and motives for delin-
quency and means for controlling it are often relatively simple. A young man
indulges in a delinquent act without having a deep commitment to delin-
quency because of less developed impulse control and/ or because of lesser
reinforcement of family restraints and because he has relatively little to lose
even if caught. Matza (1964) is one scholar who refers to this type of delin-
quency. However, the concept of situational delinquency is undeveloped and
is not given much relevance in the problem of delinquency causation. It is a
supplement to rather than a replacement of other types.

<h1>
Factors Involved
</h1>
<p>
Researchers generally agree that a number of factors play an important part in
a youngster’ s delinquencies. We can divide these factors into two groups:
individual factors and situational factors. The former include personality traits
like submissiveness, defiance, hostility, impulsiveness, feeling of 1nsecurity,
fear, lack of self- control and emotional conﬂict while the latter may be
sub-divided into five groups: family, companions, school environment,
movies and work environment. We will mainly discuss here the family’s
contribution to delinquency.
</p>
<h1>
Family
</h1>
<p>
Many theorists consider family as the most significant factor in the devel-
opment of juvenile delinquency. Class status, power group relations and class
mobility, are also directly or indirectly related to the family environment.
psychological theorists like Irving Kaufman (1959: 15), Sidney Berman (1964:
142) and August Aichhnorn (1969: 16) are primarily concerned with the
causation of delinquency 1n early childhood experiences, emotional depriva-
tions and child-rearing processes, which influence the formation of the
personality and the development of attitudes, values, and a lifestyle. The
abnormal expression of behaviour expressed in an anti-social form is the result

 <p>
Of these factors according to the psychologists. Whereas, the psychologist is
concerned with the identiﬁcation of individual variables, such as motivation,
drives, values, and needs, the sociologist is concerned more with the social
environment, the factors in the social system, and the functioning of the insti-
tutions that promote delinquency. Thus, the psychologists focus on internal
control while the sociologists focus on external control.
     Family environment producing delinquent behaviour may be analysed
with reference to a broken home, family tension, parental rejection, parental
control, and family economics. A normal family is described as one which 18
structurally complete (with both parents alive), functionally adequate (each
member her performing his/ her expected roles which reduces conflicts), econom-
ically secure (gratifying important needs of the members) and morally strong
(each member conforming to the moral values of the culture). The family is
abnormal if it lacks any of these characteristics.
    The broken family (where one parent is absent because of parental
separation, divorce or death) fails to provide affection and control to the child.
Glueck and Glueck (1968: 12) found in their study of delinquents and
non-delinquents that more than half of the delinquents studied were reared by
one parent, whereas only 10 per cent of the non—delinquents were reared by
one parent. Monahan (1957: 250—58), Browning (1960: 3744), Gold Martin,
slocum and Stone (1965), and Peterson and Becker (1965) also found that a
significantly greater number of delinquents than non-delinquents were from
broken homes.
    Family tension is also a major contributing factor to delinquent
behaviour. Abrahamsen (1960: 43) found that family tension results from
hostility and hatred. The youngster does not feel secure and content in the
tension-ﬁlled family environment. Long-term tension reduces family
.cohesiveness and affects parents’ ability to provide a conducive atmosphere to
satisfactory child-rearing and family problem-solving. McCords and Zola
(1959) also found that cohesive homes produced fewer delinquents whereas
homes where tension and hostility existed were good breeding grounds for
future delinquents. Gluecks (1968: 8) found that one in three delinquent
families as compared with one in seven non-delinquent families, were
disrupted when one of the parents left the family because of a tension-filled
and quarrelsome relationship.
      parental rejection or emotional deprivation has much to do with
juvenile delinquency. If a rejected or a neglected child does not find love and
affection as well as support and supervision at home, he will often resort to
groups of a deviant nature outside the family. Studies have found that mutual
rejection of parent and child markedly affects positive relationship and can

<p>
	ultimately result 1n delinquent behaviour. Jenkins (1957: 528-37) found that
parental rejection had a direct effect on the child’s development and growth of
a conscience. He stated that lack of adequate conscience, combined with
feelings of hostility for being rejected, led to aggression. Andry (1960:64) also
has maintained that delinquents were the recipients of less parental love both
in quantity and 1n quality than were the non-delinquents.
     Just as a broken home, family tension and parental rejection can affect
the capability of the family structure, methods of parental control or forms of
discipline also can play a part in the development of delinquent behaviour.
The type of discipline used by parents in rearing children varies from situation
to situation and from child to child. An authoritarian approach to discipline
affects the child in his peer group relationships as the child will not be able to
interact freely with his peers. Conversely, a too lenient attitude will not
provide the child with the necessary controls to guide his behaviour. unfair
or partial discipline fails to form an adequate conscience in the child, prevents
the adults from serving as a model to be imitated by the child, and reduce the
adolescent’s wish to avoid hurting the parent and the delinquent behahaviour
Gluecks (1968: 15—16) found that the parents of delinquents used physical
punishment more than verbal discussion. Both the parents were less
consistent in their disciplinary measures than were the parentS of
non-delinquents. If the methods of disciplining are classified as love-oriented
discipline, punitive discipline, lax discipline and erratic discipline (punitive
and lax), the last three types can be related to delinquency.
     Emotional instability and behavioural disturbances in one or both of the
parents also lead to a child’s delinquent behaviour. The child of the parents
who are constantly 1n conﬂict often exploits the situation and gets away with
a great deal of misbehaviour.
      Lastly, family economics is also an important contributing var1able in
delinquency. A family’s inability to provide for the material needs of the child
can create insecurity and affect the amount of control that the family exerts
over the child, because he often seeks material support and security outside
the home. Peterson and Becker (1965) have pointed out that the homes of
delinquents are often physically deteriorated which can affect the boy's
perception of himself and can act as a repellent, driving him away from the
home. It should, however, be pointed out that economic status and material
possessions do not explain middle and upper class delinquency. The economic
condition of the family can be one of many contributing factors in a
multiproblem family.

<h1>
	Neighbourhood
</h1>
<p>
The impact of the neighbourhood on the child is more in the urban areas than
in the rural areas. After the family, the child spends a good part of the day in
company of children in his neighbourhood. The neighbourhood can
contribute to delinquency by blocking basic personality needs engendering
culture conﬂicts, and fostering anti-social values. On the other hand, it can
supplement the inﬂuence of the home in the maintenance of social values.
congested neighbourhoods with inadequate recreation facilities deny the
natural play impulses of children and encourage the formation of delinquent
gangs. Picture houses, cheap hotels and video-halls in the neighbourhoods
become breeding places of vice and delinquency.
</p>
<h1>
Cinema and Pornographic Literature
</h1>
<p>
Movies and comic books featuring immorality, smoking, drinking and
brutality leave a strong impression on the young minds of the children and
the adolescents Many a time, they teach the techniques of crime and delin-
quency .Several children are arrested in different parts of our country for
emulating these techniques to commit thefts, burglaries and kidnapping. They
claimed to have seen such techniques succeed in the movies. These movies also
develop attitudes conducive to delinquent behaviour by arousing desires for
easy money, suggesting questionable methods for their achievement, inducing
a spirit of toughness and adventurousness, arousing sexual desires, and by
invoking daydreaming.
</p>
<h1>
	Sociology of Juvenile Delinquency
</h1>
<p>
	The major sociological theorists who have contributed to the criminological
Knowledge of delinquency are Merton, Frederick Thrasher, Clifford Shaw
and Henry McKay, George Herbert Mead, Albert Cohen, Cloward and
Ohlin Walter Miller, and David Matza. Since we have described their theories
in details in the preceding chapter, we will only brieﬂy summarize them here
for ready reference.
</p>
<p>
	Merton’s Anomie Theory (1938: 672-82) is that when there is a
discrepancy between the institutionalized means that are available within the
environment and the goals that individuals have learnt to aspire for 1n their
environment, strain or frustration is produced and norms break down and
deviant behaviour may result. Merton, thus, does not discuss individual
motivational factors in deviance (that is, in selecting one of the five alternative
modes of behaviour suggested by him) or he fails 1n explaining why all
persons in similar situations do not choose deviance.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000410">410</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:410
</h1>
<p>
	Fredrick Thrasher’s Gang Theory (1936: 381) concentrates on group
delinquency and explains positive peer influence as Cohen’s, CloWard's and
Miller’s theories did later on. Thrasher does not say that the gang is a cause of
delinquency but he says that gang facilitates delinquency. Explaining the
process whereby a group takes on certain behavioural characteristics and then
transmits them to its members, he says that a gang originates during the
adolescent years from spontaneous play groups and conflict with other
groups, transforms 1t into a gang for protecting its members’ rights and satis-
fying the needs which their environment and their family could not provide
Gradually, the gang develops distinct characteristics such as a mode of
operation and disseminates criminal techniques, excites mutual interests and
attitudes and provides protection to its members. Thrasher emphasized then
not all gang activities were necessarily devious and that much of the gang
members’ time was spent in normal athletic activities as well as in other
teenage endeavours. His thesis, thus, mainly describes how environmental
pressure is conducive to delinquent behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	Shaw and McKay’s Cultural Transmission Theory (1931: 386) holds that
delinquency 1s transmitted through personal and group contacts and that lack
of effective social control agencies contributes to the high incidence of delin-
quency in some parts of the large cities. These ‘delinquency areas’ are the
low-income and physically deteriorated areas whose members suffer from
economic deprivations. Furthermore, the boys in these areas are not necessary
sarily disorganized, maladjusted or anti-social. It is the exposure to
delinquency traditions present in these areas which makes them delinquents
But for this exposure, they would have found their satisfaction in activities
other than delinquency. Shaw and McKay acknowledge that other factors
may cause certain youngsters to become involved in delinquent activities, but
they feel that these factors are secondary to the economic and social factors
that exist in the community. It 18 this learned phenomenon of delinquency
which is developed in Sutherland’s theory also.
</p>
<p>
	George Herbert Mead’s Role Theory and Theory of the Self (1934
577—602) explain why only a limited number of persons assume criminal
identities while the majority of people remain law-abiding. He says, becoming
a delinquent and assuming a criminal identity involves more than merely
associating with law violators. The associations have to be meaningful to the
individual and supportive of a role and self-concept that he wants to become
committed to.
</p>
<p>
	Albert Cohen’s Working-Class Boy and Middle-Class Measuring rod
Theory (1955: 119) maintains that delinquency is mainly a working class
phenomenon. He states that the working-class boy finds himself at the
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000411">411</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:411
</h1>
<p>
bottom of a status hierarchy whenever he moves into the middle-class world.
To the degree to which he values middle class status either because he values
the good opinion of middle-class persons or because he has, to some degree,
internalized  middle class standards himself, he faces the problem of
adjustment. A delinquent sub-culture deals with the problems of adjustment
(that is, of status problems) by providing a criteria of status which these
children can meet. Not having learnt the behaviour that will equip them to
deal with the competitive struggle for their success, the working class boys feel
frustrated, react against middle class values and standards, and adopt their very
antithesis, that is, non-utilitarian, malicious and negativistic values. Group or
gang delinquent activity legitimizes and supports aggression against middle
class institutions.
</p>
<p>
	 Cloward and Ohlin’s  Success and Opportunity Structures Theory (1960:
86) copes with the discrepancies of Sutherland’s, Merton’s and Mead’s theories
and explains the types of alternatives available as a result of strain and lack of
legitimate alternatives to satisfy the needs. Faced with limitations on legit-
imate avenues of access to their goals and unable to revise their aspirations
downward, the ' lower-class youths experience intense frustrations which
results in their exploring nonconformist and illegitimate alternatives.
Cloward and Ohlin’s theory is difficult to test and evaluate empirically.
</p>
<p>
	Walter Miller’s Lower-Class Boy and Lower-Class Structure Theory (1958:
6) rejects ‘delinquent sub-culture’ and talks of ‘lower-class culture’ itself which
comes about as a result of the process of immigration, migration and mobility.
Those persons who are left behind as a result of these processes comprise the
lower class. They develop a distinct pattern of behaviour (which is not neces-
sarily reactive against any other class) based on distinctive (lower-class) traits
like toughness, smartness, excitement, fate and autonomy. The street group
provides the lower-class adolescent boy an opportunity to act tough and
become involved 1n masculine activities. Many of his activities, thus, revolve
round his desire to become a ‘real man’. The major criticism of Miller’s theory
is that today with mass communication, it is difficult to believe that the
distinct lower-class culture, which Miller describes, can exist in such a pure
form. Lower class is bound to be inﬂuenced by the other classes.
</p>
<p>
      David Matza’s Delinquency and Druﬁ Theory (1964: 11) rejects the deter-
ministic orientation of the Positive School that delinquent behaviour is caused
almost entirely by emotional and environmental factors. Matza feels that man
is neither totally free (as the Classical School assumes) nor is he totally
constrained (as the Positivist School assumes), but he is somewhere between
being controlled and being free. Drift stands midway between freedom and
control. The youngster, therefore, drifts between criminal and conventional
</p>

<p>
	action. Even though most of the youngster’s activities are law-abiding, he can
periodically drift into delinquency because the normal conventional controls
that usually inhibit delinquent behaviour become neutralized as a result of the
drifting process. Once he indulges 1n delinquency, he drifts back to the
tionality. Matza, thus, emphasizes on the ‘Will to crime. It 15 this 'will' which
explains why some youngsters choose delinquent behaviour while most of
their peers within the same environment choose socially acceptable modes of
adaptation. He also explains why delinquency is not an ‘either—or’, propo-
sition. Most youngsters exist somewhere along the continuum between
convention and crime. Total commitment to delinquency is uncommon.
</p>
<p>
	If we now take all the sociological theories of juvenile delinquency
together, it may be said that all sociologists have put emphasis on the
environment, on social structures and on the learning process unlike the
psychologists who consider the individual and his motivational patterns
important in delinquency.
</p>
<h1>
Methods of Treating Delinquents
</h1>
<p>
Many approaches and methods can be used in treating the delinquent. Soeme
important methods are: (1) psychotherapy, (2) reality therapy, (3) behaviour
therapy, (4) activity therapy, and (5) milieu therapy. Punishment is not
discussed as a treatment method because it is no longer viewed as a viable
technique of treatment, though some do feel that pain serves as a deterrent to
further criminal action. Restrictions and reprimands can be effective supple-
ments to the major treatment approach utilized but punishment cannot
become an end 1n itself.
</p>
<p>
	The two basic approaches in dealing with youngsters are the individual
and the group method of treatment. Of these, 1t is generally the individual
method which is used by psychologists, psychiatrists sociologists and social
workers, though psychologists sometimes do use the group method as well
Sociologists usually take a ‘social engineering’ approach to delinquency, that
is, they deal with the conditions of the social structure that breed delinquency
while psychologists treat the individual and emphasize his interpersonal
dynamics. Sociology is regarded as a theoretical discipline researching the
causes and effects of crime and delinquency. The profession of social work is
the ‘practical arm’ of the sociologists (Trojanowicz, 1973: 229). As such, the
above-mentioned six therapeutic methods are generally utilized by psycholo-
gists, psychiatrists and social workers. We will brieﬂy discuss each method
separately.
</p>
<p>
	Psychotherapy treats emotional and personality problems by psycho-
logical means, that is, by changing the attitudes and feelings about signiﬁcant
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000413">413</pagenum>

<p>
Persons (say, parents) in the client’s (delinquent’s) past. When the early
relationship of the youngster with his parents was not satisfactory, his
emotional development was often retarded, with the result that he was often
impulsive 1n his attempt to satisfy his infantile urges, not satisﬁed in the
normal manner within his family. Satisfying these urges and impulses can take
the form of anti-social behaviour. Through psychotherapy, the delinquent is
allowed by the therapist to operate in an atmosphere of love and acceptance
where the person does not have to fear severe rejection or physical
punishment. This is due to the transference established 1n which the client and
the therapist feel comfortable in exchanging communication. Thus, this
therapy involves facilitating the solving of conﬂicts and providing positive
alternatives to behaviour adaptation by the client.
</p>
<p>
	A Reality therapy is based on the view that people, unable to fulfil their
basic needs act in an irresponsible manner. The object of the reality therapy 18
to help the delinquent person act in a responsible manner, that is, refrain from
anti-social activity. For example, if a boy does not attend classes due to the
harshness of the teacher, he is made to understand that the teacher is not harsh
but is interested in helping him shape his career. Here, the present is delinked
with the past as the past cannot be changed. This therapy can be given by any
one (police officer, counsellor, teacher, social worker, family member or a
friend) because it does not emphasize nebulous psychiatric terms, extensive
testing or time-consuming case conferences. This method differs from the
psychotherapeutic method in the sense that the latter is concerned with the
past behaviour while this is concerned with the present behaviour. Whereas
the basis of psychotherapy is that a person cannot change his present
behaviour unless he can clearly tie it to the events in the past, the basis of the
the basis therapy is that the past is insignificant. In this therapy, since a child is
treated as a responsible person and not as an unfortunate youngster, it
transmits strength to the youngster. The child is expected to obey rules but he
is not rejected when he breaks one.
</p>
<p>
      Behaviour therapy is modifying the learnt behaviour of the delinquent
through the development of new learning processes. Behaviour can be
changed through positive or negative reinforcements, that in, rewards or
punishments. Negative or unpleasant reinforcements (like restrictions) will
reduce/eliminate negative behaviour (that is, delinquent activity), while
positive or pleasant reinforcements (like rewards) will maintain/increase
positive behaviour (like success on the job and in school). This requires deter-
mining each individual’s ‘reinforcers,’ that is, those aspects which the
individual (delinquent) will strive to achieve to gain personal satisfaction.
Money praise, attention, food, privileges, admission in school, freedom to

</h1>

<p>
play with children, and good clothes can be considered as positive reinforcers,
while threats, confinements, ridicule, physical punishment and depriving of
money are negative reinforcers. For modifying behaviour, both the
reinforcers can be employed.
</p>
<p>
	Activity therapy: Many children do not have the verbal ability to
communicate effectively in a conventional individual or group situation. In
activity therapy method, a group of 6—8 children are gathered/ 1nv1ted to meet
at a specific time/ place to engage in play or some artistic endeavour. The
atmosphere is permissive and the youngsters can use their time as they wish
Thus, a moderately neurotic child finds great release in a permissive
environment where he can express his hostility and aggression in creative
work, play, or mischief. Because his behaviour does not call for retaliation
punishment, or disapproval, pent-up emotions find appropriate release.
</p>
<p>
	Milieu or environment therapy attempts to produce an environment that
will facilitate meaningful change and satisfactory adjustment. This is used for
persons whose deviant behaviour is a reaction to unfavourable life conditions.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from the above methods, three more methods are also used in
the treatment of juvenile delinquents. These are: (1) social case work, that is,
assisting the maladjusted youngster in coping with his problems. Although
similar 1n many respects, technically social case work, is different from
psychotherapy. Whereas a social case-worker could be a probation officer,
prison counsellor, mental health worker, or hospital social worker, a
psychotherapist is essentially a doctor by profession. The case worker
prepares the case history of the client to explore his background
environment and relationships with his family, friends and school fellows
and evaluates his personal strengths and weaknesses so that a treatment plan
can be devised and carried out. This method however, is often not successful
with the delinquents because on the one hand, it is difficult to obtain the
delinquent’s co-operation as he has no trust in the case worker and on the
other hand, the delinquent’s family also resists and feels threatened by the
case worker’s ‘probing’. (2) individual counselling, that is, re-educating a
delinquent to enable him to understand his immediate situation and solve
his problem. In this method, no attempt is made to affect a fundamental
change of the client’s personality. (3) vocational counselling, its main
purpose is to increase the delinquent’s knowledge of his career choices, job
specifications and qualifications and training needed for successful
employment. The positive attitudes, skills and habits that the youngster
develops and refines in the work situation can be carried over to the
community and can positively affect his relationships with others.

Custody in Juvenile Institutions
</h1>
<p>
Remand Homes, Certified Schools, Reformatory Schools, Borstal Schools
and Probation Hostels are the important institutions used for the custody and
correction of the juvenile delinquents in India.
</p>
<p>
	Children Acts were enacted long back in different states for the
treatment and protection of young offenders, and the custody, trial and
punishment of the juvenile delinquents. Madras (present Tamil Nadu) enacted
such an Act in 1920, Bengal in 1922, and Bombay (Maharashtra) 1n 1924. After
that, almost all states passed these Acts. Later, in 1986, in order to bring
uniformity, the Juvenile Justice Act was passed as a Central Act. These Acts,
along with the 1986 Act, have now been repealed by the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. The review of the situation shows that
besides the Children Act, 1960, passed by the parliament for the union terri-
tories, all the states except Nagaland and Jammu & Kashmir had enacted their
laws. Around 55 districts of the country, however, were not covered by any
of the Children Acts. With the new 2000 Act, which also supersedes different
children's Acts 1n different states and union territories, the whole country
has now been brought under it.
</p>
<p>
	Both the 1986 Act and Children Acts suffered from many deficiencies in
the absence of a uniform law for the country as a whole. Some of these
deficiencies were: (1) the upper age limit in defining a ‘child’ varied from state
to state;(2) 2all states had not provided for juvenile courts, (3) the institutional
facilities were devoid of any well-defined criteria and norms to regulate
capacity, staff, and programmes; (4) no minimum standards for basic needs,
living conditions or therapeutic services existed; and (5) in most states,
neglected children were huddled together with juvenile delinquents. .
</p>
<p>
The Juvenile justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000 is the
primary legal framework for juvenile justice in India. It provides a differential
approach towards prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in the
country. This law, brought 1n compliance of Child Rights Convention, and
repealing the earlier Juvenile Justice Act of 1986, has been further amended 1n
2006,2010 and 2011. In View of the increasing rape cases in the country during
the last few years, involving juveniles, the Government of India 18 once again
contemplating bringing further amendments, particularly with regard to the
lowering the age of juvenile from 18 to 16 years.
</p>
<p>
	The 2000 Act contains statutory provisions to handle cases relating to
minor offenders, called as ‘delinquents', ‘juveniles in conﬂict with law’ or as
'children in need of care and protection. Its Section 2(k) defines a ‘juvenile’ or
a'child' as a person who has not completed 18 year of age while 2(1) says a
'juvenile in conﬂict with law’ means a juvenile who is alleged to have
</p>

<p>
committed an offence. Regarding determination of the age of a juvenile, the
Act calls for a ‘due inquiry’ by competent authority — usually the Juvenile
Justice Board. Rules under the Act lay down that medical opinion on the age
of an accused be sought only if he fails to produce matriculation or an equiv-
alent educational certificate, or a birth certificate in absence of the former.
</p>
<p>
	Besides, like previous laws, this Act also has many serious flaws. For
example, whenever a juvenile is arrested for an alleged offence, he requires to
be immediately produced before the Juvenile Justice Board. The law says that
the Board, irrespective of the offence, should release him on bail, with or
without any surety. Even, there are no provisions for rarest of rare cases in
this Act. However, certain provisions leave some discretion with the Board's
magistrate to pass orders in exceptional cases. Section 15(g), which are
brought after an amendment, states that the Board can order putting a
juvenile, between the ages of 17 and 18, in a special home for a period of not
less than two years.
</p>
<p>
	Section 16 talks about penalizing orders that cannot be passed against
juveniles and imposes an absolute prohibition on a life term or death sentence
or even any duration of jail term. At the same time, the proviso to this section
says that if the “Board is satisfied that the offence committed is so serious in
nature or that his conduct and behaviour have been such that it would not be
in his interest or in the interest of other juvenile in a special home to send him
to such special home and that none of the other measures provided under this
Act is suitable or sufficient,” it may seek the assistance of the state government
for placing him in an appropriate institution. On receiving a report from the
Board, the government may arrange for keeping a juvenile under protective
custody at a place, but not for more than three years or till he turns 18.
</p>
<p>
	Even if a juvenile turns 18 during the course of sentence, he will
continue to stay in the children’s or observation home. Not only this,
Section 44 of the Act provides for establishment or recognition of after-care
institutions by the state government for lodging juveniles after their release
from observation homes. However, the period of such stay for a juvenile
over 17 but less than 18 has been limited to three years or till he attains the
age of 20 years.
</p>
<p>
	In India, juveniles accused of a crime or detained for a crime are brought
before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), established in all states as per the
requirement of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act,
2000 (amended in 2006). Under this Act and provisions of the Criminal code
Procedure children are not to be taken to a regular criminal court. The
purpose of a separate court is socio-legal rehabilitation and reformation and
not punishment.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000417">417</pagenum>

<p>
	 The JJB consists of a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate of
the first class and two social workers, at least one of whom should be a
woman. All three people form a bench to function as a unit. Though they
have different roles they are required to coordinate for the best interest of the
child. When a child has been found guilty of a crime, the social workers are
vital to deciding the best course of action for the rehabilitation of that child.
JJBs are meant to resolve cases within a four-month period. Backlog of cases
can be addressed with an increased number of sittings.
</p>

	 A child 15 usually brought before the ]JB by a police ofﬁcer or person
from the Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU). Any organization or person
who brings a child before the court should inform their local police units first.
the police have 24 hours to produce a child before the court once he/ she is
arrested. The person or police officer who brings the child before the HE is
required to complete a report of the arrest/detainment. Once the child has
been brought before the HE he/ she is registered into the closest Observation
Home. In most circumstances the juvenile can be released on bail by the JJB.
If the police wish to interrogate the child or conduct a test identification
parade, the DB has to give an order allowing so and it can only be conducted
in the presence of the superintendent of the home. The home probation
officer (P0) in charge will also submit a report on the child.
</p>
<p>
	 With the police report and PO report the JJB calls for the child’s plea. If
the child pleas guilty the HE will pass appropriate orders for the child. To
prevent coercion, the JJB can dismiss the child’s guilty plea if 1t feels 1t was
forced. If the juvenile pleads not guilty the JJB must further 1nvestigate by
calling  witnessing and accusers to testify before the court. The juvenile is
given then opportunity to address the evidence brought before the court and
also bring witnesses to the court. According to the evidence the JJB will then
pass an order disposing of the case as it sees fit. The JJB is a child-friendly space
that should not be intimidating or overwhelming for the child.
</p>
<h1>
Remand Homes or Observation Homes
</h1>
<p>
These homes are meant for children during the pendency of their trial in the
JJBs, but they are also used for keeping the homeless, destitute and neglected
children. The stay here is used for evaluating their personality traits and
behaviour. AS such, these homes are viewed more as observation homes than
as places of detention.
</p>
<p>
	The important characteristics of a good Remand Home are: segregation,
education, training, recreation facilities, health care, controlled discipline and
effective supervision. Since the child 1n the Remand Home comes into contact
with the law for the first time, if the environment is not kept conducive, the
child might become suspicious and defiant towards the courts.

	In India, Remand/ Observation Homes do not exist in all states.
According to 1993 figures, Remand Homes are found only in 14 out of 25
states and in one union territory. The highest number of Remand Homes are
found in Maharashtra, followed by Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, kerala,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Of about 154
Remand/ Observation Homes, a little more than half are run by the
government and a little less than half by voluntary agencies. There are
separate homes for boys and girls. Of the total 1nmates in the Remand Homes,
15 to 20 per cent are juvenile delinquents and the rest are homeless, destitute
and neglected children. Of the total 1nmates, two-thirds belong to 7-14
years age group while the remaining one-third are either below seven years or
between 14 and 18 years.
</p>
<h1>
Certiﬁed or Reformatory Schools
</h1>
<p>
Juveniles given detention order by the JJBs are kept in Reformatory Schools
for a minimum period of three years and a maximum period of seven years,
Inmates of about 18 years age are transferred to Borstal Schools. These
schools, meant only for boys, remain under the supervision of prison
department. Each school having a capacity of 80—100 inmates is divided into
4—5 dormitories and each dormitory has 4—5 cells. Each school has a superin-
tendent, deputy superintendent, deputy jailer, assistant jailer, doctor, 3-4
instructors, 2-3 teachers and some wardens. Training is given in tailoring,
toy-making, manufacturing leather goods, and agriculture. Each training
programme is of two years. The inmate gets the raw material from the school
and the things manufactured by him are sold 1n the market and the profit
deposited in his account. After the deposits have reached a fixed amount, the
inmate has to produce things only for state use. The inmate even gets basic
education up to the fifth standard and he has to appear in the examinatioé (at
the end of the year) conducted by the Inspector of Schools. If the inmate
wants to study beyond the fifth standard, he is admitted 1n the outside school,
Since no work is forced upon the inmates here, they live like family members.
However, no follow-up records are maintained by the schools after the release
of the inmates. Secondly, the training programmes are too old and traditional.
</p>
<h1>
Borstal Schools
</h1>
<p>
Provision was made in the 1920s for the segregation of adolescent offenders
from the adults so that correction services, free from the authorities
atmosphere, be made possible for the young offenders. Borstal Schools were
thus established for youthful offenders in the age group of 16—21 years. Up to
1993, there were Borstal Schools in nine states only in the country: Tamil

<p>
Tamil nadu (1926), Andhra Pradesh (1926), Bihar (1926), Punjab (1926), Madhya
pradesh (1928), Maharashtra (1929), Uttar Pradesh (1938) and Kerala and
karnataka (1943). As of 31 December 2016, there are 21 functioning Borstal
schools 1n India, with a combined total capacity for 2, 218 inmates. The
capacity of each school varies from 100 to 350 inmates. Though these schools
distinction under the general supervision of the Inspector General of Prisons,
each school however, has its own Visiting Committee consisting of one
judge, one district magistrate, district level school officer and four
non-government members. No inmate is kept here for less than two years or
more than five years. Thus, only those delinquents are sent to these schools
who are awarded more than three years term. Each school 18 divided 1nto
houses and each house has a House Master. Each house 18 further divided into
groups and each group has a monitor. These monitors are selected from
amongst the inmates themselves. There is a grading system too in the school:
ordinary , star and special star grades. Those inmates who violate the norms
demoted to penal grade, but in ordinary cases, they are promoted from
grade to the other. No inmate is eligible to be released from the school
unless he has reached the special star grade. On admission 1n the school, he 18
first observed for three months and given some ordinary work like, say,
gardening. On being kept in the ordinary grade, he 18 assigned some training
programme, depending on his education and potential. Each promotion
more freedom and more privileges. The daily routine includes two
basic education and 5—6 hours’ vocational training. Every 1inmate gets
5 day's leave 1n one year to visit his home. Normally, the inmate remains in
continuous contact with his family members through correspondence and
their visits. Some schools have created a panchayat system too and have thus
associated the inmates with the management of the schools. In many cases,
inmates are released from the schools before the expiry of the term also.
before the release from the Borstal School, the Discharged Prisoners Aid
society is informed so that it can chalk out the after-care programme for the
released inmate.
</p>
<h1>
Probation Hostels/Homes
</h1>
<p>
These institutions, established under the Probation of Offenders Act, are meant
provide residential care and treatment to the offenders released under
probation under the supervision of a probation officer. The inmates are given
complete freedom to go to the market and also to take up jobs of their choice.
    An evaluation of all types of juvenile institutions shows that though
inmate's lifestyle is satisfactory and they enjoy better freedom but the 1nstitu-
suffer from being overcrowded, the management is centralized, the

	training programmes are too traditional and inmates are not given individual
attention. The budget allocation for them is also too low. One study made
long ago (1968) to evaluate the juvenile correctional institutions was by the
Indian Council of Social Welfare under the directorship of S. D. Gokhale. In
this study, 229 inmates released during the period of five years were inter-
viewed. It was found that the (1) training given in these institutions does not
help the inmates to get jobs, (2) institutions do not provide facilities for formal
school/college education, (3) counselling and case work facilities are inade-
quate, (4) individual attention is not paid to the inmates, and (5) institutions
have limited budgets which prevents them from making adequate planning
      A study of 27 institutions for the socially handicapped children in
Rajasthan (including Juvenile Reformatory, Observation Homes, Probation
Home and Children Home) conducted by M.S. Bedi in 1975-76 also pointed
out that: (1) institutional facilities are underutilized and occupancy rate of
institutions is much below their capacity; (2) the quality and the content of
vocational training is poor. It does not equip the inmate with skills essential
for him to rehabilitate himself economically after being discharged from the
institution; (3) space and physical amenities for inmates fall short of the
minimum standards laid down by the Central Social Welfare Board; (4)
protection services during institutionalization (against tough and aggressive
inmates, homosexual assaults, snatching of eatables and other things by fellow
inmates) and after discharge (against old accomplices, police harassment,
immoral traffickers, etc., are not provided; and (5) facilities to inmates for
communicating with family members, kin and friends are inadequate. Even if
it is assumed that some changes must have been introduced in these homes in
the last 25—30 years, it can be safely surmised that there is a great need of
restructuring these homes.
</p>
<h1>
Preventive Programmes
</h1>
<p>
	Juvenile delinquency being mainly an urban phenomenon, both private and
public agencies have to be involved in delinquency prevention, particularly
because of the complexities of the urban society.
The three approaches to delinquency prevention are: (1) organizing
activities that contribute to healthy personality development and adjustments
of children, (2) controlling environment of children contributing to delin-
quency, and (3) organizing specific preventive services for children. The first
approach links the delinquency prevention with: (i) general improvements in
the institutional structure of the society, for example, family, neighbourhood
school, (ii) raising the income levels of poverty-stricken families, (iii)
providing job opportunities to children, (iv) establishing schools, (v)
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000421">421</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
roving job conditions, (vi) providing recreational facilities in neighbour-
(vii) improving marital relations through family counselling services
family social work, and (viii) imparting moral and social education.
ventive activities of the second type include community organization and
efforts of welfare and child care agencies. Preventive activities of the third
include probation and parole services, Certified and Borstal Schools,
children Homes, Probation Hostels, and so forth.
The preventive programmes have also been classified (Trojanowicz,
73: 188) as: (1) pure prevention or primary prevention, which attempts to
 delinquency before it takes place, and (2) rehabilitative prevention or
secondary prevention, which deals with youngsters who have been adjudi-
delinquents by the court.
</p>
<p>
	Lejins (1967: 3) has classified the prevention programmes as: (1) punitive
prevention, (2) corrective prevention, and (3) mechanical prevention. The first
the threat of punishment based on the idea that punishment will forestall
criminal acts; the second refers to an attempt to eliminate potential causes
before the criminal behaviour actually takes place; and the third emphasizes
placing obstacles (like increased security measures or increased police
protection) in the way of the potential criminal so that he will find it difﬁcult
commit an offence.
</p>
<p>
   The agencies concerned with the prevention of delinquency between the
1950 and the 1990s in India were voluntary children’s organizations adminis-
child welfare, schools, social welfare departments, rescue homes,
orphanages and psychiatric centres. The efforts of voluntary organizations
were less coordinated, while those of government departments more planned
and systematically organized.
</p>
<p>
     An overview of the functioning of the government institutions
(children Homes, Certified Schools, etc.) for ‘rehabilitative prevention’ is
given the earlier pages (with a discussion on ‘Custody in Institutions’). We
will briefly discuss here the ‘pure prevention programmes’. The most
important areas where the government needs to take up some measures like
providing educational, recreational, and vocational training facilities for
preventing delinquencies are the slum areas in cities. A big chunk of
population lives in slums in big cities. If theories propounded by Thrasher,
shaw and McKay, Cohen, and Cloward and Ohlin, regarding learning of
delinquencies from environment and lack of neighbourhood cohesiveness
have some justification, it is necessary that the government takes up some
measures for the welfare of the children in these areas and for their better
integration into community life.

<p>
	Family is another institution which needs greater attention. The role of
functionally inadequate families, structurally incomplete or broken families,
poor families, immoral families and undisciplined families in juvenile delin-
quency has already been elaborated. Unless these disorganized families are
reOrganized, and environment or milieu therapy is provided, frustrated and
emotionally disturbed children cannot be prevented from developing a
relationship with delinquents.
</p>
<p>
	Police running recreation units for children is a new concept. Juvenile
units in police department in cities like Mumbai and Delhi have undertaken
these tasks. The police-school liaison programme on similar lines will go a
long way in removing hostility and mutual suspicion between the police and
youngsters; in the police helping teachers 1n handling problem youth; and, in
improving the police 1mage in general.
</p>
<p>
	Initiating community programmes for educating the youngsters
regarding the detrimental effects of using drugs and becoming involved in
devious social behaviour is yet another measure in the prevention of juvenile
delinquency. Drug abuse in recent years has increased among school children
and slum-dwellers. Providing counselling services to these children experi-
menting with drugs will be an effective means of combating illicit drug use in
particular and juvenile delinquency in general.
</p>
<p>
	Programmes for run-away children also need attention. Homes for these
children to give them a chanCe to reﬂect on their own situations with the assis-
tance and guidance of staff members need to be established in big cities and
towns. These homes can help in promoting a positive communication
between run-away children and their parents and guardians so that serious
problems can be resolved.
</p>
<p>
	It may be concluded that the development of a sound public policy
regarding all aspects of delinquency prevention and control requires both
planning and evaluation by rigorous research methods. This requires Coordi-
nation between the government agencies, universities, police, judiciary and
social workers.

Domestic Violence
</h1>
<p>
The home which should be the safer place for a woman has become a place
where she faces a regime of terror and violence at the hands of somebody close
to her or should be able to trust. These women suffer both physically and
psychologically. They are unable to take their own decisions, voice their
opinions or protect themselves and their children for fear of further repercus-
sions. Sometimes, even their basic human rights are also denied.
</p>
<h1>
Definitions
</h1>
<p>
The definition of domestic violence varies depending on the context in which
the term is used. In common parlance, it is violence or physical abuse directed
towards spouse or domestic partner—usually by a man against a woman
According to Innocenti Digest (lune 2000), the term includes violence by an
intimate partner and other family members, wherever this takes place and in
whatever form.
     According to Ganley and Schechter (1996), domestic violence is a
pattern of coercive and assaultive behaviours that include physical, sexual
verbal and psychological attacks and economic coercion that adults or adoles-
cents use against their 1ntimate partner.
According to another source (www. domesticviolence. org), domestic
violence and emotional abuse have been described as behaviours used by one
person in a relationship to control the other. Partners may be married or
unmarried; heterosexual, gay or lesbian; living together, separated or dating
Examples of abuse are: (i) name-calling or putdowns, (ii) keeping a spouse
from contacting one’s family or friends, (iii) withholding money, (iv) stopping

<p>
Spouse from getting or keeping a job, (V) actual or threatened physical harm,
(vi) sexual assault, and (vii) stalking intimidation.
        Anyone can be a victim of such violence irrespective of age, sex, race,
culture, religion, education, employment or marital status. Although both
and women can be victims, but mostly these are women. A recent
research (2013) conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), in
collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and the South African
medical Research Council, finds that about one-third (30%) of all'women aged
15 years and above have suffered intimate partner violence which include
both physical and sexual attacks. The rates of abuse, h0wever, vary widely by
world regions: in Sub-Saharan Central Africa, for example, two-thirds of
women have been victimized, marking the highest portion on any section of
the planet; whereas in North America, violence from an intimate partner,
such as a husband or boyfriend, has impacted slightly more, one in five
women, according to the study.
    Besides women, children 1n homes where there is domestic violence are
also likely to be abused and/ or neglected. Even if a child 13 not physically
harmed he/she may suffer emotional and behavioural problems.
</p>
<h1>
Types
</h1>
<p>
Current research world over has brought out different types of abuse that take
place within the family. It can be criminal and includes physical assault
sitting, pushing, shoving, etc.) and sexual abuse (unwanted or forced sexual
activity). Besides, emot1onal/ psycholog1ca1 and econom1c/ f1nanc1al abuse can
also lead to criminal violence.
</p>
<h1>
Physical
</h1>
<p>
Physical viOlence is most likely what comes to most people’s minds when we
talk about domestic violence. Violence Prevention Alliance (VPA —a
network of  WHO member-states, international organizations and civil
society organizations working to prevent violence—defines physical violence
an 'the international use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against
itself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results
in or has a high likelihood of resulting 1n injury, death, psychological harm,
development, or deprivation. It involves behaviour intended to cause
feelings of intimidation, pain, injury, or other physical suffering or bodily
term. It may also include acts of hitting, slapping, punching, choking,
pushing, burning, etc, which may result in physical mjury. Physical abuse can
also include behavimirs such as denying the victim of medical care when

needed, depriving him/ her of sleep or other functions necessary to live, or
forcing him/ her to engage in drug/ alcohol use against his/ her will
</p>
<h1>
Sexual
</h1>
<p>
When someone forces another person to have sexual intercourse by way of
physical force, the threat of force, intimidation, or by use of a weapon, it is
considered rape, which is one form of sexual violence. In other words, sexual
violence is any situation in which force or threat is used to obtain partici-
pation in unwanted sexual activity. Coercing a person to engage in sexual
activity against his/ her will, even if that person is a Spouse or intimate partner
with whom consensual sex has occurred, is an act of violence. WHO has
defined sexual violence as any sexual act, attempt to obtain sexual act,
unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise
directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless
of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to
home and work.
</p>
<p>
	Sexual violence is not something that happens only between strangers
In fact, a good number of rapes occur between individuals who know each
other. In many countries, it is now against the law for a man to force even his
wife to have sex with him. It is called spousal or marital rape.
      Other forms include forced sexual activity (oral sex, sodomy, etc,)
forced sex with animals, forcing a person to have sexual intercourse or sexual
activity with another person, or forced sexual activity with objects.
</p>
<h1>
Emotional/Psychological
</h1>
<p>
Emotional abuse (also called psychological abuse or mental abuse) include
humiliating the Victim privately or publicly, controlling what he/she can and
cannot do, withholding information from h1m/ her deliberately doing
something to make him/ her feel diminished or embarrassed, isolating
h1m/ her from friends and family, implicitly blackmailing hih/her by
harming others when he/ she expresses independence or happiness, or denying
h1m/ her access to money or other basic resources and necessities. Degradation
in any form can also be considered psychological abuse.
Emotional abuse also includes verbal abuse and is defined as any
behaviour that- threatens, intimidates and undermines the victim’s self-ware
or self— esteem, or controls his/ her freedom. This may include threatening the
victim with injury or harm, telling h1m/ her that they will be killed if they
ever leave the relationship, and public humiliation. Constant criticism
name-calling, and making statements that damage the victim’s self-eteem an
also common verbal forms of emotional abuse.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000427">427</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
	 People who are being emotionally abused often feel as if they do not
own themselves; rather, they may feel that their significant other has nearly
total control over them. Women or men undergoing emotional violence often
suffer from depression, which puts them at increased risk for suicide, eating
disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse.
</p>
<h1>
	Economic/Financial
</h1>
<p>
Economic or financial violence is a form of abuse when one intimate partner
has control over the other partner’s access to economic resources. It may
involve preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, limiting the amount of
resources to use by him/her, or by exploiting his/ her economic resources.
The motive behind this may be to diminish victim’s capacity to support
himself/herself, thus, forcing h1m/ her to depend on the perpetrator finan-
cially, which includes preventing h1m/ her from obtaining education, finding
employment, maintaining or advancing careers and acquiring assets.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, the abuser may also put the victim on an allowance, closely
monitor how he/she spends money, spend his/ her money without his/her
consent and creating debt, or completely spend his/ her savings to limit
available resources.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from the above, there are also country-specific forms of domestic
violence, such as acid throwing or attack, honour killings, bride burning or
dowry violence, etc. These are discussed in details 1n chapter on crimes against
women.
</p>
<h1>
Causative Factors
</h1>
<p>
There are many causative factors in domestic violence. It mainly occurs
within the framework of patriarchy. There are several theories linked to the
causes-from psychological (personality traits and mental behaviour) to social
(family structure, learned behaviour etc.) The reasons could be:
(a) childhood socialization, growing upseeing abuse in parents,
(b) previous experiences of abuse in relationships,
(c) psychological disorder of anger or sadism,
(d) sense of insecurity in marital bond, and
(e) frustration at work.
    Some other reasons for domestic violence pointed out by sociologists
and feminist scholars like Buzawa and Buzawa (cited in Shirwadkar, 2009:
145) are unequal distribution of power in society leading to women occupying
positions inferior or subordinate to men. According to them, historical and
social acceptance of gender stereotyped roles, which legitimize and justify
aggression against women, contribute to family violence against women.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000428">428</pagenum>




<h1>

<p>
	Within the broader context of violence against women, exploring the
issue of domestic violence or violence within the family, the United Nations
Commission on the State of Women, in its Vienna Declaration, noted that
from the existing empirical evidence regarding causation of Violence, four
generalizations could be drawn as under:
°      Violence in the family occurs primarily by men against women
°      Most victims of violence within the family and society are the
       weakest owing to their sex (women are considered to be weaker sex),
       age (children, elderly) and physical fitness (disabled). It can also be in
       terms of dependency relationships of various natures (e.g., economic
       or employment status in an organizational setting, and so on).
'      Violence occurs when the imbalance of power is challenged and the
       perpetrator fails to recognize and respect the victim’s basic human
       rights, fundamental freedom, dignity and right to peace and security,
       and acts accordingly.
°      Violence has always existed in various forms but 1t is only during the
       last decade that violence against women has been increasingly
       acknowledged to be a serious issue in terms of both magnitude and
       effect (Bokil 1n Shirwadkar, 2009. 237— 38).
       Discourse on domestic violence is not as loud and widespread as it
should be. This is mainly because this‘subject is so easily hushed away as a
matter of personal nature to be resolved within the family itself. Very recently
concluded popular reality show on television “Satyamev Jayate” aired an
episode on this issue titled as “Danger at Home”. This sensitised both media
and society as many alarming facts were exposed. There was a mention of two
separate studies, one organized by the Ministry of Health and Family welfare
Government of India and the other by the Planning Commission, Which
showed that anywhere between 40 and 80 per cent of women in India are
victims of domestic violence (www.satyamerayate.1n/1ssue 07/learnmore
accessed on 22 August 2013).
</p>
<h1>
Coping Mechanism
</h1>
<p>
The subtle and complex phenomenon of domestic violence has not only
called for various analytical perspectives but also various practical approaches
for its resolution. The analytically perspectives have dealt with the socio-
logical factors affecting domestic violence, the economic dependence of
women and their consequent vulnerability and the 1ssues of sexuality. The
practical approaches, on the other hand, have dealt with the role of law
judiciary, state and social policy. But the broad conclusion 1s that the coping
with this menace becomes difficult because marriage and family are

	considered as institutions in the private domain where state and judiciary
cannot intervene.
     This situation has prompted for search of alternate sociological
approaches. At present, most of the assistance is provided to the victim
Through counselling and legal services by the feminist groups or
welfare-oriented NGOs. But, the scope and outreach of such services is
limited in view of the gigantic nature of the problem. Moreover, these are not
pro-active services. Unless a woman approaches them, they do not provide
assistance. In this regard, the area that is not sufficiently researched into is how
domestic violence can be addressed through women’s collectivities like
self-help groups (SHGs) (Bokil 1n Shirwadkar, 2009. 238—40).
        According to Ranjana Kumari (also in Shirwadkar, 2009: 220-21), we
should democratize our institutions for combating domestic violence. The
three steps in this regard could be: (i) democratization of family to allow
women to be equal partner in decision-making; (ii) no discrimination between
sexes in society; and (iii) equal representation of women in state.

<p>
	   Poonacha, in her paper, in Shirwadkar (2009: 25—26), writes: “Strategies
to cope with domestic violence may broadly be classified as those that seek to
prevent/eradicate violence and those that react/ respond to such instances.
the preventive measures can further be classified as three-fold, namely,
research and documentation, social action and awareness generation. The first
step requires research and documentation on the nature and extent of
violence. It is from a clear social analysis of violence and an understanding of
the use and limitations of the legal system that it would be possible to devise
preventive strategies that are communicated to the field staff and social
workers of the organizations. Secondly, social action to prevent violence
requires neighbourhood vigilance and the creation of new socio—economic
options (through employment opportunities and skill training) for women
who are likely to face violence. It also requires the empowerment of women
with the knowledge of their rights and enabling them to access information
about the various government welfare schemes. Lastly, the awareness gener-
ation programme exposes the extent to which women’s rights are violated
through media campaigns and publicity programmes that seek to create
gender-just laws and reform of the prevailing criminal Justice system.”
    Poonacha further writes: “Reactive measures can also be categorized as
three-fold (1) research and documentation of cases and experiences to under-
stand the lapses in investigation and the legal system; (2) emotional, material
and legal support to the survivor to enable her to rebuild her life as well as that
of her children; and (3) efforts to raise community/neighbourhood opinion
against domestic violence and the mobilization of the entire community to

	oppose violence and support the woman. Additionally, there is need for
shelter homes, short stay homes, legal aid, counselling and child care facilities.

<h1>
The Indian Scenario
</h1>
<p>
It is really surprising that despite spread of education and awareness, domestic
violence is on the rise all over the world. A study by WHO shows that
domestic violence cuts across all the countries of the world. In India too, all
forms of abuse covered under the term ‘domestic violence’, such as physical
sexual, verbal, emotional and economic, are common. It was for the first time
when the Indian National Family and Health Survey-3 (NHFS-3) in 2005-06
addressed these concerns and officially recorded the data pertaining to the
domestic violence 1n the country. Accordingly,
°   One in three ever-married women report having been slapped by
    their husband.
°   Between 12 and 15 per cent report having their arms twisted, being
    pushed, shaken, kicked, dragged, or beaten up, or having something
    thrown at them.
°   10 per cent report that their husbands have physically forced them to
    have sex.
°   One 1n seven ever-married women have suffered physical 1njuries as a
    result of spousal violence.
°   For most women who have ever experienced spousal violence, the
    violence first occurred within the first two years of their marriage.
    Crime against women in India touched a new high in 2012 with a total
of 2,44, 270 cases registered (NCRB, Government of India), of which 1,06,527
cases were related to cruelty by husband or his relatives. But, it is also
pertinent to mention that the reported cases of domestic Violence in the
country represent only the tip of the iceberg, whereas the majority of cases are
invisible both socially and institutionally. The worst problem in India is that
the victims do not feel victimized. The way women are brought up in India
explains why only one-fourth of them seek help to end violence meted out by
their husbands.
</p>
<p>
	In India, domestic Violence was recognized as a criminal offence in 1983
The offence chargeable under section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)
that relates to domestic violence is any act of cruelty by a husband (or his
family) towards his wife. However, till 2006, there was no separate civil law
addressing the specific complexities associated with domestic violence,
including the embedded nature of violence within familial networks, the need
for protection and maintenance of abused women, and the fact that
punishment and imprisonment for the husband may not be the best
</p>

<p>
resolution in every case. Accordingly, after a decade-long process of consulta-
tions and revisions, a comprehensive domestic violence law, known as the
protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005, took effect in 2006.
</p>
<h1>
The protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
</h1>
<p>
the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was brought
into force by the Government of India from October 26, 2006. For the
purposes of this Act, any conduct of the respondent shall constitute domestic
violence if he, (a) habitually assaults or makes the life of the aggrieved person
miserable by cruelty of conduct even if such conduct does not amount to
physical ill-treatment; or (b) forces the aggrieved person to lead an immoral
life; or (c) otherwise injures or harms the aggrieved person. However, nothing
contained in clause (c) above shall amount to domestic violence if the pursuit
of course of conduct by the respondent was reasonable for his own protection
or for the protection of his or another’s property.
</p>
<p>
	The key elements of the law include the prohibition of marital rape and
the provision of protection and maintenance orders against husbands and
partners who are emotionally, physically, or economically abusive. In a
nutshell, the salient features of the Act are as follows:
     It seeks to cover those women who are or have been in a relationship
     with the abuser where both parties have lived together in a shared
     household and are related by consanguinity, marriage or a
     relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption; in addition
     relationship with family members living together as a joint family are
     also included. Even those women who are sisters, widows, mothers,
     Single women, or living with the abuser are entitled to get legal
     protection under the proposed Act.
     The term ‘domestic violence’ includes actual abuse or the threat of
     abuse that is physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic.
     Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the woman or her
     relatives would also be covered under this definition.
     One of the most important features of the Act is the woman’s right to
     secure housing. The Act provides for the woman’s right to reside in
     the matrimonial or shared household, whether or not she has any
     title or rights in the household. This right is secured by a residence
     order, which is passed by a court. These residence orders cannot be
     passed against anyone who is a woman.
     The other relief envisaged under the Act is that of the power of the
     court to pass protection orders that prevent the abuser from aiding or
     committing an act of domestic violence or any other specified act,
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000432">432</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
entering a workplace or any other place frequented by the abused,
attempting to communicate with the abused, isolating any assets used
by both the parties and causing violence to the abused, her relatives
and others who provide her assistance from the domestic violence.
° The Act provides for appointment of Protection Officers and NGOs
to provide assistance to the woman with regard to medical exami-
nation, legal aid, safe shelter, etc.
The Act provides for breach of protection order or interim
protection order by the respondent as a cognizable and non-bailable
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend
to one year or with fine which may extend to twenty thousand rupees
or with both. Similarly, non-compliance or discharge of duties by the
Protection Officer is also sought to be made an offence under the Act
with similar punishment.
</p>
<p>
	Actually, in all societies, family matters are seen as personal and not to
be intervened by any outsider. In India, societal attitudes that convey accep-
tance or justification of domestic violence have made the situation more
worse. In a shocking revelation by UNICEF’s “Global Report Card on
Adolescents 2012”, not just Indian men, but even adolescents—in the 15-19
age group—feel that wife beating is justified. Not only this, over half of the
Indian adolescent girls, or around 53 per cent, think that a husband is justified
in beating his wife (Times of India, 25 April 2013).
</p>
<p>
	Much is said about safety of women in public places but statistics show
that women are equally vulnerable in their own homes. To conclude, 1t can be
stated that the domestic violence or violence within family is a big social
problem today and unless and until serious efforts for its solution are not
made, women will continue to be denied justice. The violence can be stopped
both by the victim as well as the perpetrator. The women has to gather
courage to say ‘No’ to it and walk out if necessary. But the onus of stopping
the violence is on source—the man who carries it out.

	Alcoholism
</h1>
<p>
The problem of alcoholism, until a few decades ago, was considered a moral
problem and a sign of social irresponsibility. After the introduction of the
prohibition policy in some states, it was viewed as an illegal act. Now, it is
considered by some scholars more as a complicated, chronic and immensely
costly disease than a type of a deviant behaviour. The victim needs not the
punitive treatment but treatment by specialists—psychiatrists, doctors, social
workers and others—who will help him in his personality reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
    Alcoholism has much in common with the problem of drug abuse. Both
consist essentially of the habitual use of chemical agents to produce a tempo-
rarily pleasant mental state. In either case, the results can be extremely
dangerous. Addicts in both require therapy rather than penal action.
However, in spite of these similarities, the two problems are considerably
different and require separate discussion. Most drinkers in India are rare, infre-
quent and moderate drinkers and the compulsive drinkers or alcoholics are
only a minority. Drinking is not as dangerous as drug addiction.
</p>
<p>
	Alcohol is not a stimulant; it is a depressant or inhibitor on the central
nervous system. Alcohol relaxes the customary controls on behaviour and the
drinker becomes less restrained and feels more free. But taking alcohol even
once in a while leaves the possibility of a habit-forming phenomenon open
and the drinker may start taking it frequently and in large quantity which
could have tragic and disastrous effects. It may affect him physically, destroy
his ability to work and earn, ruin his family life, and demoralize him utterly
An innocent recreation, thus, may come to spoil the whole life of the drinker
But before analysing the causes and effects of alcoholism, let us understand
some basic concepts.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000435">435</pagenum>

<h1>
The Concept
</h1>
<p>
Alcoholism is a condition in which an individual loses control over his
alcohol intake in that he is constantly unable to refrain from drinking once he
begins GohnSon, 1973: 519). According to Keller and Vera (1955: 619—644),
alcoholism is characterized by the repeated drinking of alcoholic beverages to
an extent that exceeds customary use or compliance with the social customs of
the community and that adversely affects the drinker’s health or interferes
with his social or economic functioning.
</p>
<p>
	An alcoholic is different from an ‘occasional drinker’. Any person who
takes alcohol is a ‘drinker’, while a ‘compulsive drinker’ who cannot live
without taking alcohol is called an ‘alcoholic’. According to Waskin (1964:
362), an alcoholic is an excessive drinker whose dependence upon alcohol has
reached such a degree that it results in a noticeable mental disturbance or an
interference with his bodily and mental health, his interpersonal relations, and
his smooth social and economic functioning; or one who shows the early
signs of such developments. Clinebell (1956: 17) has defined an ‘alcoholic’ as
one whose drinking interferes frequently or continuously with any of his
important life adjustments and interpersonal relationships.
</p>
<p>
	Broadly speaking, alcoholism has been characterized by four factors: (1)
excessive intake of alcoholic beverages, (2) individual’s increasing worry over
his drinking, (3) loss of the drinker’s control over his drinking, and (4) the
disturbance in functioning in his social world.
</p>
<p>
      Richard Blum (1973: 508) has referred to drinking in two contexts: (i) in
the context of prescribed social pattern where drinking is integrated in the
culture of the society and it is perceived as part of everyday life, (for example,
in Italy, the United States) and people do not find any psychological potential
in it; and (ii) in the context of perceiving alcohol use as disruptive to culture
and society and people find addictive potential in it (as 1n India) and View
drinking as a means of seeking pleasure and escape. Drinkers have been
Classified as ‘non-addicts’, ‘addicts’ and ‘chronic alcoholics’. Non-addicts are
categorized as ‘experimenters’ and ‘regulars’. Don Cahalan has given a
five-fold classification of alcohol drinkers on the basis of the frequency of
drinking (and not the quantity of alcohol taken):
1.   Rare users, who drink once or twice a year.
2.   infrequent users, who drink once or twice in two-three months, that is,
     less than once a month.
3.   Light drinkers, who drink once or twice a month.
4.   Moderate drinkers, who drink three or four times in a month.
5.   Heavy drinkers, who drink every day or several drinks during the day.
     The last category of drinkers is also described as ‘hard core’ drinkers.

Extent of Alcoholism
</h1>
<p>
India is showing a phenomenal increase in alcohol consumption in recent
years, though the consumption levels are still very low vis-a-vis the global
standard. According to WHO, worldwide, while recorded adult per capital
consumption has remained stable at around 4. 3—4. 7 litres of pure alcohol since
1990, the corresponding figure for India was only 0.6 litre (in 2005). However,
as per some studies done around the country, the per capita consumption is 2
litres per adult per year (calculated from official 2003 sales and population
figures). After adjusting for undocumented consumption, which accounts for
45 to 50 percent of total consumption, this is likely to be around 4 liters.
</p>
<p>
	Research in the past few years has conclusively demonstrated that nearly
one in three male adults consume alcohol. It has been estimated that India has
nearly 70 million alcohol users which include 12 million users who are
dependent on alcohol, but does not include millions of social drinkers. A
recent National Household Survey of Drug Use recorded alcohol use in only
21 per cent of adult males. In the total spectrum of alcohol consumption in the
country, only about 50 per cent is documented and the rest is undocumented.
</p>
<p>
	Despite the overall low consumption, patterns of alcohol consumption
vary throughout the country. For example, alcohol use is relatively high in
north-eastern and southern states of India and Goa as compared to other parts
of country. The prevalence of current use of alcohol ranged from a low of 7
per cent in the western state of Gujarat (officially under prohibition) to 75 per
cent in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.
</p>
<p>
	There 15 also an extreme gender difference. Prevalence among women
has consistently been estimated at less than 5 per cent but is much higher in
the north-eastern states like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The
report of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro sciences
(NIMHANS), Bengaluru (2011) reveals that nearly 30-35 per cent of adult
men and approximately 5 per cent of adult women consume alcohol (male to
female ratio being 6:1).
</p>
<p>
	Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) and beer are the preferred drinks in
younger age groups, while country made liquor and rum are common in rural
India. Home-made or local brews continue to be popular in select commu-
nities, especially in north-eastern parts, Goa, etc. Significantly, higher use has
been recorded in per1-urban/trans1t1onal areas. Interestingly, these are the
areas with growing income levels and are, thus, entering the spiralling loop of
alcohol use and its harm.
</p>
<p>
	Alcohol use is also directly associated with education, social class and
occupation. Alcohol use among the poor communities contributes to
increasing expenditure on alcohol on one hand and 1ncreasing resources spent
for managing alcohol related problems on the other.
</p>

<p>
	The average age of starting alcohol use has reduced from 28 years during
the 1980s to 17 years in 2007. Once begun, the average duration generally lasts
for more than 10 years. What starts as experimentation and pleasure—seeking,
often becomes an addictive process. The amount of drinking also increases
with age and duration. Social drinkers generally graduate to become
hazardous and pathological drinkers over time. More than 50 per cent of
regular alcohol users also fall into the category of hazardous drinking.
</p>
<p>
	 India is generally regarded as a traditional ‘dry’ or ‘abstaining’ culture.
Yet, it has one of the largest alcohol beverage industries in the world. Even in
the South-East Asia region it is the dominant producer of alcohol6 (6 5%) and
contributes to about 7 per cent of the total alcohol beverage imports into the
region. According to the Alcohol Atlas of India, published by the India
Alcohol Policy Alliance (IAPA) (2010), there has been a steady increase in the
production of alcohol 1n the country, with the production doubling from
887.2 million litres 1n 1992—93 to 1,654 million litres 1n 1999-2000 and to
almost treble at 2,300 million litres by 2006—07.
</p>
<p>
	The NIMHANS report (2011) further indicates that the bulk of alcohol
produced in India is mainly from sugarcane molasses. Roughly 52 per cent of
alcohol produced in India 13 for potable purposes. Among the potable forms
of alcohol IMFL and country liquor account for nearly 60 to 70 per cent of
the total alcohol consumed.
</p>
<p>
	 Alcohol is also one of the important sources of revenue for the govern—
ments. During 2008—09 the excise revenue was nearly 400 billion rupees. '
nearly 90 per cent of this was contributed by the alcohol beverage industry.
</p>
<p>
Process of Becoming an Alcoholic
</p>
<p>
A 'drinker’ has to pass through various stages to become an ‘alcoholic.
According to an American psychiatrist Jellinek (1946: 368), an alcoholic has to
pass through the sequence of seven phases. (1) blackouts, in which the individual is
not able to find a solution to his individual problems, (2) sneaking drinks, in
which he takes alcohol without being observed, (3) increased tolerance, in
which he tolerates the increased effects of drinking. (4) loss of control, in which
he fails to control the desire of not taking alcohol, (5) development of an alibi
system, in which he gradually starts neglecting his social roles, (6) going on
periodic benders, in which he keeps on drinking regularly, and (7) regular
matutinal drinking, 1n which he regularly starts taking alcohol in the morning.
     Jellinek (ibid.) has also explained the process of becoming an ‘alcoholic’
in the following four stages:
1.     Pre-alcoholic symptomatic phase: In this phase, taking advantage of social
       sanction, an individual starts drinking to reduce tensions and solve his
</p>














<pagenum page="normal" id="page000438">438</pagenum>

Page no:438
</h1>

<p>
	personal problems. Linking drinking with relief, he keeps on searching for
    those opportunities in which he may drink. The frequency of drinking
    increases as he starts losing his capacity to overcome conﬂicts in life.
2.  Prodigal phase: In this phase, along with the increase in the frequency of
    drinking, there is increase in the quantity of the drink too. However, he
    develops a guilt feeling and knows that gradually he is becoming an
    abnormal person.
3.  Crucial phase: In this phase, his drinking becomes conspicuous. He
    develops rationalizations to stand social pressures and to assure Himself
    that he has not lost control over himself. However, he does not lose his
    self-respect. Gradually, he starts alienating himself from others as his
    physical and social deterioration becomes obvious to them.
4.  Chronic phase: In this phase, he starts drinking even in the morning. He
    faces prolonged intoxication, impaired thinking, indefinable fears,
    tremors, and loss of certain skills. He is all the time obsessed with
    drinking and feels restless without alcohol.
    Though every alcoholic does not necessarily pass through all these four
stages and in the same sequence, most of the alcoholics have to go through this
process.
</p>
<p>
	Jellinek (ibid.) also studied the phases in the drinking history of
alcoholics and developed a typical addictive pattern. He listed the character-
istic alcoholic behaviour and the time sequence of its appearance. The mean
age of the first occurrence of some of the characteristic behaviours of an
alcoholic was found by him as: starts drinking at 18.8 years of age, sneaks
drinking at 25.9 years age, indulges in extravagant behaviour at 27.6 years,
starts losing friends at 29.7 years, becomes indifferent to the quality of the
liquor at 30 years, starts losing working time at 30.4 years, faces family disap-
proval at 30.5 years of age, loses job at 30.9 years, indulges in daytime drinking
at 31 years of age, takes to anti-social behaviour at 31. 3 years, faces tremors at
32. 7 years, starts fearing at 32. 9 years, takes sedatives at 35.5 years, feels
religious needs at 35.7 years, seeks medical advice at 35.8 years, is hospitalized
at 36.8 years, admits to self the inability to control at 38.1 years, admits to
others the inability to control at 39.5 years, and reaches lowest point (that is
hits the bottom) at 40.7 years. Analysing the above characteristics, one sees the
increasing loss of social responsibility on the part of the individual; sees him
gradually losing control over his personal behaviour and then in the later
stages desperately seeking help from every possible source, ranging from
religion to medicine and hospitalization.
      Alcoholics may be classified in three groups: steady (balanced and
supported), periodic, and plateau (expanse of high level). The steady alcoholic
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000439">439</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:439
</h1>
<p>
is one who is not constantly saturated with alcohol. The periodic alcoholic
abstains from drinking for considerable periods of time and then goes on
binges. The plateau alcoholic is one who drinks more deliberately than either
of the above two types and tends to seek the maximum effects from alcohol.
He seems to need to maintain a certain level of saturation at all times but does
have the capacity to spread the effect of his alcohol over a long period of time
(Landis, 1959: 21—22).
</p>
<p>
	In terms of social status, the alcoholics are classified as the low bottom
and the high bottom types. The former refers to the person who has hit the
bottom of social status, while the latter is one who still maintains a fairly
respectable status in spite of his drinking.
</p>
<p>
	 What is sociologically important in alcoholism is the socialization to
accept alcohol. Indian culture does not view alcohol drinkers as normal. As
such, people are not mentally prepared to accept alcohol as an important part of
social life. While 1n the western society, phrases like‘ ‘Have a drink” or “Would
you care for a drink” are common in evening gathering, in India, on the other
hand, we usually talk of “Have a cup of tea”. Thus, alcoholism is a serious social
issue in our culture. Though in comparison to drugs, drinking is considered less
harmful and even trivial by many parents who themselves drink, still, liquor is
not perceived as respectable. Occasional drinking may be tolerated but regular
drinking is condemned. We must, therefore, clearly distinguish between a
person who uses alcohol 1n moderation and one who is a ‘problem drinker’, or
between  a person who drinks responsibly and one who drinks in a manner that
causes problems to himself, to his family, and to society.
</p>
<p>
	Alcoholism in the police force has surprisingly increased during the last
few decades or so. A study conducted by one senior police officer (Arun
oraon) in Punjab pointed out that 37.06 per cent of Punjab policemen take
alcohol (Wye Hindustan Times, July 8,1995). Of this percentage, drinking
habits are more prominent amongst the lower ranks with 26.42 per cent of the
constables admitting that they drink. A vast majority of the habitual drinkers
is formed by the personnel posted at police stations. The reason perhaps is the
easy availability of liquor which is normally ‘gifted’ to them by those seeking
favours. Among reasOns for alcoholism in the police, according to the study
are: high workload, harassment by superiors, bad company, family problems
and getting ‘kicks’. Alcoholism in police breeds violent and corrupt practices.
     Danger inherent in an alcoholic is measured in terms of the percentage
of alcohol content in his blood stream. With one drink, a person contains
0.035 per cent alcohol level in the blood but with two drinks he contains 0.05
per cent level. Though legally he is not considered drunk but he feels mild
effects and his driving ability is impaired. With an alcohol level of 0.1 per cent
</p>


















<pagenum page="normal" id="page000440">440</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:440
</h1>

<p>
in the blood, a person is legally considered "drunk when involved in a driving
accident. His judgement, vision and muscle coordination lS impa1red. With
alcohol level of 0.25 per cent, a person is viewed as ‘quite intoxicated’ while
with 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent level, he is viewed as ‘severely intoxicated'. It
may cause coma in some individuals. Lastly, with alcohol level of 0.5 per cent
to 0.8 per cent, a person’s breathing and heart action slows down and even
death may occur (McVeigh and Schostak, 1978: 110).
One of the big problems of alcoholism is that the individual does not
recognize himself as an alcoholic. An American psychiatrist Robert V.seliger
has developed a check-list of sOme twenty questions. If the answer to even a
few of these questions is ‘Yes,’ the individual may well take it as a warning of
serious trouble ahead. Here are some of the questions from the check-list:(1)
Do you lose time from work due to drinking? (2) Is drinking making your
home-life unhappy? (3) Is drinking affecting your reputation? (4) Have you
ever felt remorse after drinking? (5) Have you got into financial difficulties as a
result of drinking? (6) Do you turn to lower companions as a result of
drinking? (7) Does your drinking make you careless of your family’s welfare?
(8) Has your ambition decreased since drinking? (9) Do you have crave for a drink
at a particular time daily? (10) Does drinking cause you to have difficulty in
sleeping? (11) Has your efficiency decreased since drinking? (12) Is drinking
jeopardizing your job or business? (13) Do you drink to build up your
self-confidence?

Causes of Alcohol Abuse
</h1>
<p>
In 1nterpreting the causes of alcoholism, the important thing to bear in mind
is that, of those who use alcohol, about 90 per cent do not become alcoholics.
The key to alcoholism is in the motive for repeating the drinking. Therefore,
explaining alcoholism only in terms of factors like personality structure will
be inadequate. No wonder, a psychogenic view is described as an oversim-
plified explanation of alcoholism. One psychological view is that practically
all alcoholics show the mark of deprivation of emotional needs during
childhood. Clinebell (1956: 45) reports four main types of parental attitudes
which happen to be associated with alcoholism in adulthood and all of which
tend to produce trauma and emotional deprivation in the child: (1) authoritar-
ianism, (2) overt rejection, (3) moralism, and (4) success worship. That these
factors are the key ones in the formation of an insecure personality resulting
in falling prey to alcohol is indicated by the fact that psychological studies of
alcoholics repeatedly mention the following personality traits: a high level of
anxiety in interpersonal relationships, emotional immaturity, ambivalence
towards authority, low frustration tolerance, low self-esteem, feelings of

<p>
isolation and guilt (ibid.: 49). These psychological traits are not the result of
alcoholism but are the causes of alcoholism. They are often present in many
alcoholics before they take to excessive drinking.
</p>
<p>
	According to some scholars, there seems to be a definite connection
between alcoholism and personality maladjustment. Initially, a person drinks
to seek refuge for his problems of life or to find a temporary respite from his
troubles Gradually, he starts drinking more and more frequently until he
becomes utterly dependent on it. However, psychologists maintain that only
those people take to frequent drinking who are emotionally immature and
lack self-confidence.
</p>
<p>
	Around what personal problems of adjustment do anxiety, tension,
guilt, frustration arise? According to Bacon (1959: 208), the main problems
are: an individual’s opinion of himself, gaining and holding the respect and the
affection of others; conﬂict with others through self- assertion, through
criticism, through out-and-out aggressions; overall security as to ownership,
prestige, personal safety as they are tied up with money; responsibilities
accepted in the achievement of specific goals; and sexual matters.
</p>
<p>
	The sociological reasons for taking alcohol are essentially the same as for
taking drugs. However, a distinction can be made in the causes of drinking
alcohol and taking illicit drugs. Since alcohol is more socially acceptable than
drugs, drinking reduces a person’s fears, worries and anxieties. Besides, alcohol
is more easily available than drugs. It is also cheaper than many drugs like
heroin, cocaine and LSD. The main sociological causes of taking alcohol are:
(1) environmental pressures, (2) peer pressure, and (3) a dominant sub-culture.
      The question is. Why do certain persons choose drinking as an answer to
environmental pressure while others do not? Here, certainly personality and
cultural factors are the major conditioning elements in the individual’s
experience. Cultural taboos and lack of availability of liquor due to the prohi-
bition, policy keep many people away from being exposed to its use. One may
conclude from this that alcoholism can be explained only on the basis of a
holistic approach rather than a single-factor approach.
</p>
<p>
	 A question is raised whether pressures can be located in the culture itself
both to cause and to contain alcoholism. It is said that some cultures are better
able to develop effective controls over the individual than others. A research
in the united States shows that there are very few teetotallers among the Jews
(13%), compared to Catholics (21%) and Protestants (41%). In France,
Germany and the United States, the use of wine has been very common. It is
only recently that alcoholism has become a major crisis in the life of the
people of these countries. Once people start using alcohol because of the
cultural sanctions, they use it frequently, especially in situations of insecurity

<p>
	The current approach is that alcoholism is to be understood in terms of
character and motivation. An alcoholic is a sick man. He is not to be looked
upon with ridicule, condemnation and blame. He has fallen a victim to a set of
complexes, attitudes and habits which bind him until the process of
self-destruction is inevitable.
</p>
<h1>
Consequences of Alcoholism
</h1>
<p>
Alcohol has now become a common word in Indian society. With the impact
of globalization, urbanization, industrialization, media inﬂuence and changing
lifestyles, alcohol has entered the lives of Indians in a big and unrestricted
manner. The consequences of alcoholism—in terms of personal misery, family
budget, family discord, loss of wages, failure of health, accidents and cost in
damage claims, cost of hospital treatment, cost in custodial treatment in jail,
monetary damage in courts, and inducement to crime—are almost disastrous
Social deviance and social problems emerge from the use and abuse of alcohol
Though the number of annual arrests for public drunkenness is not much in
our country, it is a known fact that a large number of alcoholics are not arrested
because of the fact that arrest is not considered a good solution to the problem.
A good number of persons arrested for crimes like rape, burglary, murder and
theft are those who committed them while under the influence of alcohol,
Alcohol is a major factor in highway accidents. Besides, it contributes to
thousands of deaths every year.
</p>
<p>
	A high percentage of admissions to hospitals, particularly mental
hospitals, is related to persons with ‘alcoholic disorders’ or a ‘drinking
problem’. Other socially deviant acts related to alcohol/ drugs are thefts,
bribes, wife battering, and suicides. Studies on suicide point out that the
suicide rate is 50 times higher among alcoholics/ drug users than
non-alcoholics and non-drug users.
</p>
<p>
	Since alcohol1cs/ drug users directly affect four or five other persons
(wife, parents, children, siblings, close friends, co-workers), the problem-
affects millions of people in the country. Families of alcoholics and drug users
suffer the most. Even family violence, family unrest and divorce is caused by
alcoholism. Drinking affects the business, the office efficiency and factory
production also. Absenteeism, low output and poor judgment leading to
work-related accidents, costs the government billions of rupees. Most
factory-owners indicate a lack of interest and deny the existence of these
problems among their employees in the factories/ offices to save themselves
the botheration of adopting effective measures for prevention.
The drinker thinks that alcohol will reduce his tension, guilt, anxiety
and frustration. But, the fact is that 1t reduces his operational efficiency to

<p>
below the minimum level necessary for social existence or even for a bare
existence. A drinker harbours the mistaken notion that alcohol can make
association and interpersonal activity easier in society. But, in reality, alcohol
breaks down an individual’s participation in associations and thus socially
weakens the individual. It impairs socially valuable ideas.
</p>
<p>
	One consequence of alcoholism is that it has increased illicit bootlegging.
since independence, hundreds of tragedies have taken place throughout the
country in which thousands of people have died on consuming liquor
produced illicitly. The victims of spurious sum invariably are poor people.
about 132 lives were lost and 200 persons suffered physically in Baroda in
hooch tragedy in 1989; 200 persons living in four slums in north-west Delhi
died on taking illicit liquor on November 6, 1991; about 100 persons died in
south Mumbai in a similar hooch tragedy on January 1, 1992; about 60
persons died in Tamil Nadu in March 1992; about 200 persons died in Cuttack
city in Orissa (now Odisha) on May 7, 1992; about 52 people died and more
than 400 were taken ill after consuming spurious liquor in Hazaribagh and
two Other districts of south Bihar on November 19, 1994, and more than 33
people died in a hooch tragedy in Pudukkottai 1n Tamil Nadu 1n October
1996. In another hooch tragedy in Bengal, at least 143 people died 1n its South
24 paragana district in December 2012. The same year, about 28 people died
due to consumption of illicit liquor in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar 1n Odisha.
And, recently (16 October 2013), over 30 people died following consumption
of spurious liquor in Mubarkpure area of Uttar Pradesh’s Azamgarh district.
such disasters will continue to take place in future, too. But, no one has ever
heard of people dying after consuming IMFL. The country liquor has various
brands though all of them are generally of the same quality and price. The
alcohol content in the country liquor is about 28 per cent, while 1n sum it is 32
per cent. Usually pyridine is used for denaturizing rectified spirits. This 15
neutralized by citric acid. As the rectified spirit is licensed, sometimes it is
adulterated with methylated spirit. The poisonous drinks damage the
eyesight, liver and kidney in the long run. The administration will remain
unresponsive to tragedies of taking illicit liquor and the government will have
lackadaisical attitude in tackling this problem. At the most it will give an
ex-gratia payment of Rs 1 lakh or so to the families of those killed in such
tragedies. The perfidious role of bootleggers, their muscle and money power
are a matter of record in communal riots. Many cities in the country are torn
asunder by the bootlegger-police-politician nexus. The margin of profit in
bootlegging is estimated to be 9 to 12 times the actual investment. No wonder,
a number of anti-social elements make it their business to manufacture,
transport and distribute illicit liquor. Justice Miyabhoy Commission

instituted by the Gujarat government in 1981 to enquire into the prohibition
policy of the state submitted his report in 1983 and pointed out the nexus
between baron bootleggers and politicians and the fact that almost all the
bootleggers in the state (Gujarat) were anti-social elements capable of terror-
izing anyone trying to expose them.
</p>
<p>
	Recently, it has been observed that curbs on liquor lead to more deaths.
According to government statistics for the years 2009-11, states with restricted
consumption top hooch tragedies tally compared to those with unrestrictive
consumption. For example, states like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh—all with complete or partial ban on alcohol—that record
maximum deaths in hooch tragedies. The data shows that Tamil Nadu has
recorded 1,095 deaths, with Karnataka a distant second with 599 deaths
followed by Punjab and West Bengal—both recording over 400 deaths-and
Gujarat ranked fifth with 396 deaths due to spurious liquor between 2009 and
2011. Conversely, states such as Goa, where consumption of legitimate
alcohol is promoted with low taxes, there have been no instances of hooch
tragedies during this period and the state has recorded zero deaths (Times of
India, 22 October 2013).
</p>
<h1>
Societal Costs of Alcoholism
</h1>
<p>
Even if one attempts to calculate the societal costs of alcoholism, he Will not
able to do that. Because, according to the NIMHANS (2011) study, the
societal costs linked to alcohol use can be broadly categorized as direct and
indirect, tangible and intangible. Direct costs are the medical costs linked to
treatment, transport costs, rehabilitation costs and in the event of death
funeral costs. Indirect costs include property damage, litigation costs, loss of
insurance, and others. Intangible costs are those due to absence from work,
decreased productivity, absenteeism, sickness leave, loss of school for children
and many others. Besides, governments also incur huge expenditure for
managing harmful effects of alcohol use. The collective costs of all these are
also difficult to estimate.
</p>
<h1>
Treatment of Alcoholics
</h1>
<p>
Alcoholism is more treatable than drug addiction. There have been many
successful treatment programmes. Since there is a continuum between use and
abuse, there are various kinds of programmes for different degrees of
drinking. Psychotherapy, environment therapy, behaviour therapy, and
medical therapy are suggested and used for different types of drinkers. In
medical therapy, hospitals and clinics give alcoholic patients the drug
‘Antabuse’ (technically called Tetra Ethylthiu Ramdisul Fide) (Walsh and
Furfey, 1958: 151). This drug is inexpensive and is taken orally. It produces no

<p>
effect whatever unless the patient drinks alcohol; in that case, it quickly
produces extremely violent and unpleasant but not dangerous symptoms.
thus, it can guard the drinker against relapse.
</p>
<p>
	In psychotherapy, resocialization is reinforced through counselling and
through group therapy. In environment therapy, the drinker is made to
change the environment where his behaviour may be easily controlled. In
behaviour therapy, his fears and inhibitions are removed to enable him to
develop self-confidence and self-reliance. Thus, the following treatment
measures are mainly used to treat drinkers and alcoholics:
</p>
<p>
1.   Detoxtﬁcation in Hospitals: For alcohol addicts, the first step is ‘detoxiﬁ-
     cation’. Alcoholics need medical care and medical supervision.
     Tranquilizers are used for treating their withdrawal symptoms like
     convulsions and hallucinations. High potency vitamins and ﬂuid
     electrolyte balance are also used in their physical rehabilitation.
2.   Role of Family: Involving an alcoholic’s family in his treatment and
     rehabilitation enhances the chances of success by 75 to 80 per cent. The
     family members do not preach; nor do they blMe or condemn the
     alcoholic. They minimize his problems, offer him sincere and unselfish
     help and guidance, and never abandon him.
3.   Alcobolics Anonymous. One of the most effective social therapies which
     uses group interaction is Alcoholics Anonymous. It is an organization of
     Ex-alcoholics which started in the United States in the early 19408 and
     today has lakhs of persons as its members. In India, the branches exist in
     all the metropolitan cities, while in some cities, the branches have been
     established recently.
</p>
<p>
	Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an organization, a group of people,
    fellowships of men and women, who share their experience, strength
    and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem
    (i.e.,,alcoholism) and help others recover from alcoholism. In AA, even
    such alcoholics are found who were dismissed by medical fraternity as
    'hopeless cases’, who had been admitted in the psychiatric units for the
    proverbial nth times, who had no desire to be treated but were dragged
    to the hospitals by relatives and friends to ”reform them. Having failed
    to reform in these units, they are brought to AA. There are cases in AA
    who had been in and out of AA at least eight to ten times, who after
    'leaving' AA hit the bottle again, yet they are brought back to AA and
    again learn to stay off the bottle, seeking the help of the group of fellow
    alcoholics. These are the people who believe that medicine can treat the
    physical complications of alcoholism but it cannot cure the disease. The
    cure has to come from within and that is what AA offers.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000446">446</pagenum>






<h1>
Page no:446
</h1>
<p>
    At one time, generally 30 to 40 members are found in an AA who are
    from all walks of life, cutting through religion and financial status
    (FAMILY, July 1995: 104-5). Most members are sober, some inebriated,
    but all very seriously involved in what is going on. The AA meetings
    mostly comprise of three parts: (i) a talk by the chairperson that is open,
    frank and hard- hitting, (ii) autobiographical stories, and (iii) open session
    What really drives people to quit alcohol after Joining AA? In the
    outside world, an alcoholic is considered a social outcaste and feels
    forever chastened, which adds to his problems. In AA, all members
    share his situation and suddenly the alcoholic realizes that there is a hope
    for reform. The organization helps the ‘patient’ in healing by humanely
    reaching out to him as he has a real desire to stop drinking. The
    fellowship offers strength and hope.
4.  Treatment Centres: These centres have been developed in some cities as
    alternatives to hospital treatment. Each centre has about 10-20 residents
    Here, not only counselling takes plaCe in a supportive environmnment but
    residents are made to follow certain anti-drinking rules too.
5.  Changing Values through Education: Some voluntary organizations
    undertake educational and information programmes to alert the
    alcoholics to the dangers of excessive drinking. Social workers help the
    drinkers in coping with life and changing the social values and attitudes
    about drinking.

<h1>
Prohibition
</h1>
<p>
Gandhiji regarded the consumption of liquor as a major social evil and
favoured complete prohibition in India. With this in view, the Constitution
of India included Article 47 in the Directive Principles of State Policy, which
states, “The State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of use, except for
medicinal purposes, of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to
health.” After independence, some states took up the programme of prohi-
bition earnestly and some half-heartedly. In the last five decades or so, most of
them have given up prohibition even though most leaders pay lip-service to
the programme. Things have gone so far that in some states even cheif
ministers, Ministers and their close relatives are running distilleries for
manufacturing liquor, and their supporters and relatives are blessed with
liquor licences. Individual politicians have thus developed vested interests in
the manufacture and sale of liquor. The excuse they offer 1n justification
against not introducing prohibition is  that their governments will lose huge
revenue without which they cannot launch their development projects.
</p>

	Alcoholism o 431 page NO:447
</h1>

<p>

After independence, Madras Province and Bombay State implemented
prohibition between 1948 and 1950, and total prohibition was in operation in
Madras State, Maharashtra, Gujarat and 11 districts of Andhra Pradesh from
1958, to 1969, and other sizeable areas in Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa (now
odisha), Karnataka and Kerala. One- fourth of India's population was under
prohibition by 1954, and in the same year, the Prohibition Enquiry
Committee set April 1958 as the target to achieve national prohibition.
However, the potential loss in state revenue due to loss of excise revenue from
the sale of alcohol discouraged most state governments from enforcing
Long -term prohibition. Alcohol accounted for almost 10 per cent of total state
revenues, and over one- third in the case of Punjab. In 1964, the Centre offered
to compensate the state governments 50 per cent of their loss in excise
revenue caused by the implementation of prohibition. Most states did not
take up the proposal and lifted prohibition, however, Gujarat retained it.

</p>
<p>

	A renewed push for prohibition occurred under the Morarji Desai
government cut in 1977, but it failed to achieve nationwide prohibition. The
negative effects of prohibition including wide-scale sale of spurious and cheap
liquor the rise of organized crime and bootlegging due to the growth of a black
market for alcohol, a large police force required to implement prohibition and
loss employment connected to the alcohol industry reduced demands for
prohibition and led to calls for regulation of alcohol. Anbumani Ramadoss
urged for a national alcohol policy and nationwide prohibition while serving as
Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare from May 2004 to April 2009.


</p>
<p>
	A recent times, as mentioned earlier, a new trend is observed;
government  data for the period 2009 to 2011 confirms that states like Gujarat,
which have prohibitive regulations against alcohol, suffer a disproportionate
share of  hooch fatalities, compared to those with unrestrictive consumption.
Actually  our governments have failed to realize that revenue earned from the

sale of liquor is far less than the expenditure incurred on the social conse-
quences  of alcoholism. According to one study, 1n the state of Karnataka, 1t
was  observed that the social costs of alcoholism far exceeded the revenues
generated from alcohol. Based on a small sample of alcohol dependents, it was
estimated that the losses were to the tune of Rs 18.39 billion when compared
to a revenue of Rs 8. 46 billion. One study estimated that Indian society might
have lost an estimated Rs 244 billion due to the different consequences of
alcohol  while the revenue generated by the government“ was approxi-
mately Rs 216 billion for the year 2004, raising the question “are we losing
more than  What we are gaining?”
</p>
<p>

The present state of affairs can be summed up as: “everybody wants

prohibition but nobody wants it to be implemented”. No wonder, some

committees/ commissions appointed by some state governments recommend

implementation of total prohibition‘ 1n stages. Can politicians afford to reject

imposing ban on armc/e and closing more than 5,000 armc/e shops. 1‘ I.

</p>
<h1>
	Role of Women
</h1>
<p>

Women activists, women’s organizations and even ordinary housewives in
both urban and rural areas can spearhead the struggle to convince men against
liquor consumption and force governments to introduce prohibition they
can demand the political parties to include prohibition in their poll
manifestoes. It was in 1993 when a small group of neo-literate women in
Dabbagunta village in Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh, fed up with the
drunkenness of their men, attacked a liquor shop, drove away its owners and  .
destroyed the stocks of indigenous wine. The spark provided by the  unorga
nized women of a small dusty village caught the imagination of the
womenfolk all over Andhra Pradesh, from where the agitation spread to
other states in the country.

</p>
<h1>
	Control on Alcoholism
</h1>

<p>
	With the failure of the prohibition model, state governmental control has come
to be focused on the regulation of the liquor trade. The state government
under the open licence system, leave the alcoholic beverage trade to private
enterprise under licensing and regulation, the nominal public objectives being
to eliminate people with criminal or questionable financial histories and to
control the physical location of licensed liquor shops. Every state government
earns crores of rupees every year when it auctions the contracts.
</p>
<p>
	Radicals argue that as long as our social structure and economic system
continues to produce inequality, unemployment, poverty, injustice and
role-strains and tensions, alcoholism will persist. Since the present social
systems operating in our society produce more frustrations and deprivation
the rate of drinking would only accelerate 1n future. What IS, therefore
needed 18 a policy and programme to produce more jobs, permit fair compe
tition and reduce corruption and nepotism in appointments and promotions
If the lives of people are made meaningful, rewarding and satisfying, the need
for alcohol would not exist or it will be minimized. Secondly, education about
the harm and hurt that alcohol can bring to a person’s life and to society will
help control the use of alcohol. Parents can impart education on the danger
of becoming an alcoholic as well as punish the deviants and create the
necessary fear. Parents’ education should be concerned with shaping the
attitudes and behaviour conducive to non-drinking. Lastly, schools and
colleges can also educate young students about the psychological and social

logical effects of alcohol and alcoholism.

	 It is indeed a tragedy that our governments and political parties have not
been able to follow the ideals we cherished during our struggle for
independence. Gandhiji could not think of an independent India without
prohibition. For him, prohibition was an integral part of the freedom
movement. He categorically declared that if he were to be appointed dictator of
the country for one hour, his first action would be to close all liquor shops
with out paying compensation. He was so emphatic in his assertions that he was
even prepared to let the people go without education, if that was the price to be
paid for introducing prohibition. According to him, the evil of drinking was
worse  than theft and even prostitution, as it was the mother of both these evils.

</p>
<p>
	 It may, thus, be concluded that the problem of alcoholism calls for a

concerted attack which may embrace treatment, social measures, education
and  research.

that has harmful consequences for society. In several western countries, drug

	In spite of this, drug abuse in India is still considered more as an aberrant
 behaviour than an anti-social or a non—conforming behaviour. By this, one
means that the aberrant person conceals his transgression from social norms
of society, violates norms without questioning their legitimacy, and attempts
to escape the penalties for violating norms without proposing changes in
them. The aberrant person is believed to be out to satisfy his private interests.
</p>
<p>
	Merton (1979: 829-32) has distinguished between ‘aberrant’ and
non-conforming’ behaviour to show the significance of various kinds of
norm violations. The ‘non—conformist’ challenges the legitimacy of the norms
(goals and/ or means) and he publicly rejects and advocates the substitution of
new norms, but the ‘aberrant person’ neither questions the legitimacy of
norm nor seeks replacement of old norms with new norms. No wonder,
sociologists perceive drug abuse in India as aberrant behaviour, and drug users
and addicts as aberrant persons, who unlike non-conformists, are not inter-
ested in improving social conditions or benefiting mankind.

	 Several researches have been conducted on drug abuse in India in the last
three decades by medical scientists, psychiatrists and sociologists. This author
conducted two studies on drug abuse among college/ university students in
1976 and 1986 in Rajasthan not only to analyse the problem of extent of drug
abuse but also to study its causes and suggest measures for controlling it.
Before examining the findings of these researches, let us first try to understand
the basic concepts in drug abuse terminology.

</p>


<h1>
	Basic Concepts
</h1>
<p>

The concepts of drug, drug abuse, drug dependence, drug addiction and absti-
nence syndrome need some clarity. Drug 1s a chemical substance associated
with distinct physical and/ or psychological effects. It alters a person’s normal
bodily processes or functions. But, this definition is too broad. In medical
parlance, a drug is a substance prescribed by a physician or manufactured
expressly for the purpose of treating and preventing disease and ailment by its
chemical nature and its effect on the structure and functions of a living
organism. In the psychological and sociological contexts, drug is a term for
habit forming substance which directly affects the brain or nervous system.
More precisely, it refers to “any chemical substance which affects bodily
function, mood, perception, or consciousness which has potential for misuse,
and  which may be harmful to the individual or the society” (Jullian 1977). In
this sense the frequent use of drug 15 considered so dangerous and sometimes
even immoral and anti-social that 1t arouses a variety of indignant and hostile
sentiment on the part of general public. Some drugs are, however, relatively
innocuous and are not addictive or accompanied by harmful physiological

	effects. The use of such drugs stands in marked contrast to the use of illegal
drugs like heroin, cocaine and LSD or the consumption of legal .drugs like
alcohol, tobacco, barbiturates and amphetamines, all of which are associated
with distinctly harmful physical effects on the person a habituated to them
</p>

<p>
	Drug abuse is the use of illicit drug or misuse of legitimate drug resulting
into physical or psychological harm. It includes smoking ganja or hashish
taking heroin or cocaine or LSD, injecting morphine, drinking alcohol and so

forth. These are sometimes referred to as being ‘high on speed’ or trip or
‘ ‘getting kicks’.

</p>
<p>
	Drug dependence denotes habitual or frequent use of a drug. The‘ 'depend
ence’ can either be physical or psychological. Physical dependence occurs
with the repeated use of the drug when the body has adjusted to the presence
of a drug and will suffer pain, discomfort or illness if the use of the drug is
discontinued.

</p>
<p>
	Addiction is generally referred to describe physical dependence. Thus,
‘addiction’ or ‘physical dependence’ is “a state whereby the body requires
continued administration of the drug in order to function”. Body functioning
is interfered with if the drug is withdraWn, and withdrawal symptoms . appear
in a pattern specific for the drug. The total reaction to deprivation lS known as
abstinence syndrome.

</p>
<p>
	The chronic drug user develops a feeling that he must constantly
increase the dose 1n order to produce the same effect as that from the initial
dose. This phenomenon 13 called tolerance’. It represents the body’s ability to
adapt itself to the presence of a foreign substance. However, tolerance does
not develop for all drugs or in all individuals; though with certain drugs (for
example morphine), addicts have been known to build up great tolerance very
quickly. ‘Cross tolerance’ refers to the fact that tolerance development for one
drug may also result in tolerance for similar drugs.

</p>
<p>
	Psychological dependence occurs when an individual comes to rely on a
drug for the feeling of well-being it produces. The word ‘habituation’ is
sometimes used to refer to psychic or psychological dependence. "The
difference between ‘habituation’ and ‘addiction’ is that habit is not
compulsive as addiction is. Addiction to a drug means that the body becomes
so dependent to the toxic effects of the drug that one just cannot do without
it. The characteristics of drug addiction are: (1) an overpowering desirer
need (compulsion) to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any ma
(2) a tendency to increase the dose; (3) a psychological and generally a physical
dependence on the effects of the drugs; and (4) an effect detrimental to the
individual and to the society.

<h1>
		Nature and Impact of Abusable Drugs
</h1>

<p>
The abusable drugs may be divided into eight categories: stimulants inhalants,
imannabinoids, depressants, opioids and morphine derivatives, anabolic
peroids, hallucinogens and prescription drugs.
 Stimulants speed up the body’s nervous system and create a feeling of
energy They are also called ‘uppers’ because of their ability to make you feel
very awake. Stimulants have the opposite effect of depressants. When the
effects of a stimulant wear off, the user is typically left with feelings of sickness
and a loss of energy. Constant use of such drugs can have very negative effects
on the user. In order to prevent extreme negative side effects of these drugs
and the impact they have on life, drug treatment centres are often recom-
mended . Cocaine, methamphetamines, amphetamines, ritalin and cylert are
main stimulants.
</p>
<p>
	 Inhalants are sniffed or huffed and give the user immediate results. Unfor-
tunately, these immediate results can also result in sudden mental damage.
when inhalants are taken, the body becomes deprived of oxygen, causing a
rapid heartbeat. Other effects include liver, lung and kidney problems, affected
sence of smell, difficulty walking and confusion. Types of inhalants include
glues, paint thinner, gasoline, laughing gas and aerosol sprays.
. Cannabinoids result in feelings of euphoria, cause confusion and
memory problems, anxiety, a higher heart rate, as well as staggering and poor
reaction time. These drugs include hashish and marijuana.
</p>
<p>
	Depressants slow down activity in the central nervous system of your
body. These drugs are also called "downers because they slow the body down
and seem to give feelings of relaxation. Depressants are available as
prescription  drugs to relieve stress and anger, although drowsiness 1s often a
side effect The ‘relaxation’ felt from these drugs is not a healthy feeling for the
body to experience, to stop abuse of this drug, drug treatment is suggested.
The major depressants are barbiturates, benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam,
gamma hydroxybutyrate, methaqualone, alcohol and tranquillisers.
</p>
<p>
	Opioids and morphine derivatives can cause drowsiness, confusion,
nausea, feelings of euphoria, respiratory complications and relieve pain. These
include codeine, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, heroin, morphine, opium,
oxycodone  HCL, hydrocodone bitartrate, acetaminophen.
</p>
<p>
 Anabolic steroids are taken to improve physical performance as well as to
 enlarge muscles and increase strength. Negative effects of steroids include
baldness cysts, oily hair and skin, acne, heart attack, stroke and change in
vioce. Hostility is also a frequent side effect of anabolic steroids. Types of
drugs include anadrol, oxandrin, durabolin, stanozol and dianabol.

<p>
	Hallucinogen: change the mind and cause the appearance of things that
are not really there. Hallucinogens affect the body’s self- control, such as
speech and movement, and often bring about hostility. Other negative side
effects of these drugs include heart failure, increased heart rate, higher blood
pressure and changes in the body’s hormones. These drugs  include ISD
(lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, psilocybin, cannabis and magic
mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Prescription drugs can be very helpful drugs when used properly and
when under the guidance of a qualified physician. These drugs can be used as
aids in surgery, to treat medical conditions and while controlling various
symptoms. Misuse and abuse of prescription drugs however can be very
dangerous. Types of drugs include opiods (codeine, oxycodone, morphine)
central nervous system depressants (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) and stimu
lants (dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate).

<h1>
	Extent and Nature of Drug Abuse
</h1>

<p>
	How widespread is the use of illegal drugs and the misuse of legal drugs in our
country? According to recent surveys, India has at least 7.5 crore drug addicts
The number has been increasing at an alarming rate. A study, conducted by
the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), has
claimed that drug abuse has increased among youngsters in the 16-25 age
group. Data gathered by researchers over a period of three decades, from 1978
to 2008, shows that while 22 per cent of the patients in the ﬁrst decade
(1978—88) belonged to the 16-25 years age group, the percentage went up to
31.5 per cent in the third decade (1999—2008). The study also shows that there
has been an increase in opioid dependence cases over the decades increasing
from 36. 8 per cent in the first decade to 53. 2 per cent of the total cases, in the
last decade (Indian Express, May 12, 2012)
</p>
<p>
	Mostly 1t is the younger generation that fall an easy prey to it. What
started off as casual use among a minuscule population of high-income group
youth in the metros has now permeated to all sections of society. Indian
produced pharmaceuticals, heroin and alcohol are amongst the most. abused
drugs. It 13 said that with a turnover of around $500 billion, it is the third
largest business 1n the world, next to petroleum and arms trade. Actually in
India, the cultural values are changing, the poorer class is suffering with
economic hardship while at the same time there IS a massive rise in the upper
class. All this, combined with the dwindling support of family (due to increase
work and western life), is leading to drug abuse and addiction.
Besides, over the past few decades, India has seen a rise in industrial
ization and urbanization, which has caused large migrations to its cities. This

is causing their traditional culture and way of life to slowly loosen. The
individual Indians and their new way of life is causing them to be very
vulnerable to the stresses and strains of the modern way of life. These stresses
and strains may cause the person to turn to drugs to calm their thoughts and
deal with everyday life.

</p>
<p>
	" India’s approach towards narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is
enshrined in Article 47 of its Constitution which mandates that the “state
shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for
medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to
health. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 was
enacted with stringent provisions to curb this menace. The Act prohibits,
except for medical or scientific purposes, the manufacture, production, trade,
use etc of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. It also envisages a
minimum term of 10 years imprisonment extendable to 20 years and fine of
Rs.1 lakh extendable up to Rs. 2 lakh for the offenders. It has been further
amended by making provisions for the forfeiture of properties derived from
illicit drugs trafficking.
</p>

<p>
	Besides, several measures involving innovative changes in enforcement,
leagal and  judicial systems have been brought into effect. The introduction of
death penalty for drug-related offences has been a major deterrent. Compre-
bensive strategy involving specific programmes to bring about an overall
reduction in use of drugs has been evolved by the various governmental
agencies and NGOs and is further supplemented by measures like education,
counselling,  treatment and rehabilitation programmes. At international level,
india has also bilateral agreements on drug trafficking with 13 countries,
including Pakistan and Burma.

<h1>
	Empirical Studies
</h1>

<p>
 Empirical 	studies of three different sections of population conducted in India
 indicate the extent of drug abuse prevalence. These studies are: (1) study of
college /university and high school students, (2) study of industrial workers,
and (3) study of people in rural areas.
</p>

<h1>
 Study 	College/ University Students

<p>

The studies on drug abuse among college/ university students may be classified
as (a) single  studies, (b) joint studies, and (c) multicentred studies. Single studies
were conducted by scholars like Banerjee (in Calcutta m 1963), Dayal (in
Delhi in 1972), Chitnis (in Bombay 1n 1974) and Varma (in Punjab 1n 1977).
Joint studies were conducted by Sethi and Manchanda (in Uttar Pradesh in
1978)  by Dube, Kumar and Gupta (in 1969 and 1977). Multicentred

studies were conducted in 1976 (in seven cities) and in 1986 (in nine cities) and
both were coordinated by D. Mohan of the All India Institute of medical
Science (AHMS), Delhi. If we take all these studies together, we ﬁnd that the
prevalence rate of drug abuse among college/ university students varies from
17 per cent to 25 per cent in different cities. But excluding alcohol, cigarettes
and painkillers, the extent of drug consumption is only 4 per cent to 6 per
cent. Other important findings of these studies are: (1) Drug consumption
differs with respect to professional and non-professional courses. When
and Manchanda found that medical students were using more . drugs than
non-medical students, my own study in Jaipur (both in 1976 and 1986)
indicated that drug abuse among medical students was not high. In the 1976
study, I found the highest use of drugs among law students (26.1%), followed
by commerce (23.6%), arts and social sciences (17.5%), medical (14%),science
(13.6%), and engineering (4.6%) students. In the 1986 study, however the
highest use was found among commerce students (31%), followed by art and
social sciences (27.2%), science (20.3%), medical (7.3%), engineering (6%) and
law students (4.8%). (2) Of the current users, about 90 per cent are experi
menters (who take drugs once a week or less often), 9 per cent are regular
(who take drugs several times a week), and only 1 per cent are addicts (who
cannot live without drugs). (3) About 75 per cent students use only alchol
and/ or tobacco, about 15 per cent take one or the other drug along with
alcohol and/ or tobacco, and only 6 to 10 per cent take drugs other than
alcohol and/ or tobacco. (4) In terms of nature of drugs used, if we exclude
alcohol and cigarettes, about 20 per cent use pain-killers, 35 per cent use
narcotics (heroin, cocaine, cannabis, etc.) 5 to 7 per cent use stimulants and
less than 1 per cent use hallucinogens (LSD). Thus, a little more than three
fourths of the drug users take drugs, just for relaxation and fun, one- fifth?
medically prescribed drugs to alleviate physical ills, and only about 2 to 3 per
cent take drugs of abuse to escape from reality. Since ‘down’ drugs are more
popular than ‘up’ drugs, it could be inferred that the youth wish to go to sleep
rather than ‘wake up’. (5) The background of the users, is as follows: (a) under
graduates use drugs as much as the postgraduates, (b) education in public
schools increases the use of drugs among students; particularly among girls (c)
educational institutions with hostels attached to them produce more drug
users than those without hostels, (d) academic frustration is not the important
cause of drug use, that is, high or low division in examination does not . affect
the incidence of drug usage, (e) there is a relationship between drug use and
lack of interest in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, (f) the affluent
youth getting a higher amount of pocket money from their parents tend to
experiment with drugs more than the youth from the lower income groups

<p>


 though incidence of drug abuse is found more among students with an
ban background than those with a rural one, it cannot be hypothesized that
urban  upbringing is an important cause of drug use, and (h) drug-using deviant
behaviour attracts students irrespective of religion, caste or language
background.
</p>
<p>
	Taking all the characteristics of the drug users together, some high-risk
categories in drug usage can be identified. These are: high income groups, age
group of 16-21 years, public schools and hostel attached institutions.

</p>
<p>
	The researches also indicate that about 60 per cent students take to drugs
on the suggestion of friends, 5 per cent on the suggestion of some family
member or kin, 10 per cent on the suggestion of physicians, and 25 per cent of
their own accord. Thus, on the basis of the ‘initiative’ factor, a large number
of drug  users may be identified as submissive, a small number as self-directive,
and a  few as adaptive.

 Researches on High School Students
</h1>

<p>
Two important studies on drug abuse among school children are by Mohan,
Sundaram and Chawla conducted 1n Delhi 1n 1978, and by Rastogi conducted
 In 1986, one more Study was conducted on high school students in
 four metropolitan cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras by Mohan,
Pradhan Chakrabarthy and Ramchandran but 1ts analysis was not published.
Mohans study of about 2,000 high school students in 1978 revealed that
thought 63 per cent students were using drugs, a very large number of them
 took painkillers, smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol. Only 0.2 per cent to
pent cent took sedatives, stimulants and narcotic drugs. This shows that
drug abuse among high school students 13 very limited.
</p>
<h1>
Researches 	on Industrial Workers
</h1>

<p>
	Gangrade and Gupta studied 4, 000 industrial workers in the 19705 1n Delhi
and found  that the rate of drug prevalence was only 10. 4 per cent which 1n
comparison to college students 13 very low. They also found that (a) most of
the user had  started using drugs without medical prescriptions; (b) a majority
of the user in their 19205 or early 19308; (c) four-fifth workers had
started using  drugs after they had started working as workers; (d) two-thirds
were introduced drugs by friends or co-workers; and (e) sub-cultural
background, high income, low level of education, and pressure of peer groups
are the important factors that lead to drug use among industrial workers.
As regards the nature of drugs used, Gangrade found that alcohol was
used by 95 per cent of the sample studied (or by 10% of the total workers’
population) charas  by 18 per cent, Hung by 8 per cent, ganja by 7 per cent and
opium by 2 per cent. A worker spent about Rs 40 a month (in 1977) on drugs.

	Researches in Rural Areas page NO:458
</h1>

<p>
	The first research on drug abuse among people in the rural areas was
conducted in 1971 by Elnagar, Maitra and Rao in a village in West Bengal and
then in 1972 by Dube and in the same year by Verghese and Beig. They found
addiction to alcohol only in 1 to 2 per cent of the cases. However, four studies
conducted between 1974 and 1979 gave a better picture of drug abuse in rural
areas. Deb and Jindal’s study conducted in 1974 in Punjab villages found
alcohol abuse 1n 74 per cent of the adults above 15 years. Gurmeet Sing
study conducted 1n 1978 1n selected villages of Punjab found drug abuse in 29
per cent cases (of 10 and above years of age), tobacco use in 40 per cent cause
alcohol use in 26 per cent cases, opium use in 19 per cent cases, and cannabis
use in 20 per cent cases. Sethi and Trivedi’s study conducted in 1979 in eight
villages covering a population of about 2,000 persons (above ten years of age )
found the prevalence rate of 25 per cent. They found addiction in 6 per cent
cases, alcohol consumption in 82 per cent cases, cannabis consumption in 16
per cent cases, and opium consumption in 11 per cent cases. Lastly Mohan
Prabhakar and Sharma’s study conducted in 1977 in six blocks in three border
districts of Amritsar, Ferozpur and Gurdaspur in Punjab covered 1,276 house
holds and a total population of 3,600 persons above 15 years of age. Mohan
main findings were: (i) 18 per cent households studied had no drug user ,60per
cent had one user, 16 per cent had two users and 6 per cent had three or more
users, (ii) the most commonly abused drug by males was alcohol(50%
followed by tobacco (19%), opium (6%) and cannabis (1%). Among (married
females (above 15 years of age), tobacco was used by 4 per cent, alcohol by
per cent, painkillers by 1 per cent, tranquilizers, by 0.5 per cent and opium by
0.5 per cent. It can, thus, be suggested that drug abuse 1n rural areas is predocs

inantly a masculine activity.‘

</p>
<p>
	If we take all the four studies of Deb, Gurmeet Singh, Sethi and Mohan
together, they point out that among people 1n the rural areas, the use of
alcohol 18 very high followed by tobacco and opium, while the use of cannabis
is only 1 per cent to 2 per cent.

</p>
<p>
	If we take all the studies (pertaining to college/ high school
industrial workers, and rural people) together, we find that up to 1980, the use
of drugs was not high. However, after 1980, the availability of heroin' in our
country has so increased that consumption of smack and other . drug has
increased among students, slum dwellers, truck drivers, rickshaw pullers and
industrial workers. Even when these addicts are detoxified, that is, relieved of
their dependence on drugs, 90 out of 100 cannot ‘kick’ their habit, and they
continue their petty crimes to support a very expensive addiction. Today, five

drug deaths occur in Mumbai alone every day; each night more than 100
 teenagers take to drugs in the country.
</p>
<p>
	A  UN survey report compiled by the International Narcotics Control
Board released in the second week of January 1991 pointed out that in 1990
drug abuse lessened in some developed countries but grew in parts of the
THird World. The study found that the number of Russian drug abusers,
mostly of cannabis, almost doubled between 1986 and 1991 to reach an
estimated 1,40,000 (Hindustan Times, 11 January, 1991). In Europe, the use of
crack remained negligible but the use of cocaine increased. In North America
and in  Canada, cannabis and cocaine remained the drugs of choice. Drug
abuse  alarmingly increased among women between the ages of 18 and 29. In
the United States, and economic cost of drug abuse was estimated in 1990' at 60
billion dollars annually. However, there was an apparent lessening in the use
of crack and cocaine manifested 1n the drop in attributable deaths and hospital
admissions. In Africa, drug abuse has spread to the entire continent over the
past few years. Much of 1t is the use of heroin and cocaine. In South America,
the easy  availability of drug (heroin) led to its greater abuse. In East and South
East Asia illicit opium production doubled in 1988-89 from the previous year
to about 2,000 tonnes and remained at the same high level in 1990—91. In
China heroin abuse in southern border areas was spreading to other parts of
China In  Japan, cocaine seizures increased five fold. In Malaysia, heroin was
most abused, with an estimated one lakh addicts. In Bangkok, large-scale
heroin abuse was compounded by the associated rapid spread of AIDS, but
the number  of newly registered abusers has been decreasing. In Australia, the
estimated number of heroin addicts is between 90,000 and 1,30,000. In South
Asia,in Bangladesh, drug abuse rose with an estimated 50,000 users alone in
Dhaka the capital. In India, drug abuse rose in major cities.
</p>
<p>
	In a study conducted by the Ministry of Welfare, Delhi (results
 published on July 13, 1995), it has been found that a large number of drug
addicts  (about 44%) are young. Of the total addicts in the country, 4. 54 per
cent belong  to the 12-17 years age group, 13. 86 per cent to 18—23 years age
group, 30 per cent to 24-30 years age group, 35 per cent to 31—45 years age
 group,13.1 per cent to 46-60 years age group, and 3. 50 per cent are more that
60years of age. Further, a little less than half (47%) are illiterate or educated
below primary level, 21. 55 per cent are totally illiterate, 11.08 per cent can
read and write 14.90 per cent are educated up to primary level, 14.31 per cent
up to middle level, 12.90 per cent up to secondary level, 14.73 per cent up to
higher secondary level, and 6.58 per cent are graduates and 3.95 per cent

<p>
	It may be pointed out that by and large those persons are predisposed to
drug usage who (i) have difficulties 1n assuming a masculine role; (ii) who are
frequently overcome by a sense of futility, apprehension of failure and
general depression, (iii) who are easily frustrated and made anxious; and
who find frustrations and anxieties unbearable.

<h1>

Motivations in Drug Usage
</h1>

<p>
	What are the causes of drug abuse? These may be classified under four heads
(1) psychological causes, like relieving tension, easing depression, removing
inhibitions, satisfying curiosity, removing boredom, getting kicks, feeling
high and confident, and intensifying perception, (2) social causes, like facil
tating social experiences, being accepted by friends, and challenging social
values; (3) physiological causes, like staying awake, heightening sexual experi
ences, removing pain, and getting sleep; and (4) miscellaneous causes, like
improving study, sharpening religious insight, deepening self— understanding
and solving personal problems, etc. ,

</p>
<p>
	My study (of 4,081 college/ university students) revealed that of the 1,469
students who consumed drugs, 85.5 per cent took drugs because of psycho
logical reasons, 15.2 per cent because of physiological reasons, 10.9 per cent
because of social reasons, and 28.4 per cent because of miscellaneous reasons
(the total is more than 100 per cent because each category was takes
separately). The detailed analysis pointed out that (a) the largest number of
drug-using students comprised individuals who were devoted to pleasure
seeking new excitement and thrill, (b) a small number took drugs as an escape
mechanism or to alleviate distress, and (c) a very small number of student

receiving drugs in the course of medical treatment for the relief of pain
continued to take them long after the treatment was over.
</p>

<p>
	. This enables us to question the view held by psychiatrists that drug users
exhibit a personality type involving strong dependency needs with
pronounced feelings of inadequacy. It will not be out of place here to point
I ‘ ,1 that Lindesmith (1940: 120) too has provided a detailed critique of the
theory  of ‘psychopathic personality’ or ‘psychopathic predisposition’.
</p>

<p>
	My view is that drug abuse is a learnt behaviour, acquired by individuals
in interaction with peers, acquaintances, family members and others in three
ways: through persuasion, through unconscious imitation and through
reflective thinking. In the analysis of the sources of getting drugs, it was found
that (i) drugs were generally obtained from the non-medical sources (friends,
 acquaintances, family members, home cupboard), (ii) medical sources were
used more by girls than by boys, and (iii) the non—medical source mentioned
most often was ‘friend’.
</p>
<p>

 Like analysing causes of drug abuse, it is equally essential to analyse the
causes of abstinence, that is, why the non-users abstained from taking drugs or
the past users’ discontinued them. My study of students showed that the
important causes of abstinence and discontinuation were: personal (49.3%),
physiological (23.8%), social (22.4%), religious (22.3%), and economic (4.1%).
The personal causes were: lack of interest/ curiosity, personal dislike or hatred
for the  use of drugs, and non-availability of or non-accessibility to drugs; the
physiological causes were: risk of physical/ mental dangers or deteriorating
health risk of dependence on the drug, and having had a bad experience of
being on a trip’; the social causes were: pressure of friends, influence of
parents, risk of social disapproval; the religious cause was the moral principles;
and the economic cause was that individual had either no money to purchase
drug or found drugs too expensive.
</p>

<h1>


Role of Family and Peer Group in Drug Abuse
</h1>

<p>
Family and peer group associations are the primary potent influences upon
the direction which individual takes and maintains in his life. A hypothesis in
my own study of drug abuse among college/ university students was that drug
usage was influenced by the quality of affectionate family relationships. This
term affectionate family relationship) was operationalized on the following
bases(1) parents take an interest in the career of their children and are
conscious of their parental obligations, (2) relations between parents of drug
users between drug users and their parents and between users and their
sibling based on harmony and solidarity, (3) parental control is neither
very harsh nor very lenient so as to give an opportunity to the child for

<p>

self-expression, (4) the size of family is so manageable in terms of family
income that no child in the family suffers from unfulfilment of the necessities
of life, (5) parents broadly conform to social and moral norms setting
examples for their children to follow, and (6) the child exhibits a feeling of
trust and security in the parents by taking them into confidence and by
seeking their advice and help 1n facing perplexing problems.
</p>
<p>
	The study revealed that 1n a good number of cases, the families of drug
users were not "normal and family relationships were not ‘affectionate In
testing the relationship between drug usage and‘ staying away from parents it
was found that residence with parents was as important in the incidence of
drug usage as residence 1n hostel. In other words, family background is signif
icant in drug usage. The nature of family control, the discipline imposed by
the parents over the children, the parents’ interest in their friends, leisute
activities and their future career prospects and parents remaining conscious of
their obligations towards their children were found to be important factors
which determine the children’s inclination to step into the world of .drugs
The drinking/ smoking and drug taking behaviour of family members“ also
had a bearing on the use of drugs. It may therefore, be maintained that family
environment is an important factor in drug usage.
</p>
<p>
	Like the family, peer group pressure was also found influential in drug
usage. About 81 per cent drug users had friends who were drug users. Another
44 per cent drug users were initiated into drug use by their friends. Approxi
mately 31 per cent drug users always took drugs 1n the company of drugs from
friends. As many as 63 per cent drug users got first knowledge of drugs from
their friends, and 17 per cent users had first taken drugs 1n their friends’ house
All this shows that peer group culture has a significant effect on the drug use
behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	On the basis of the above analysis, 1t may be pointed out that the main
causes of drug abuse are: family environment, mental condition, social factors
like oppressive social system and power structure, subcultures (slum areas
college/ hostel sub-cultures, etc.,) peer pressures, personality factors
(dependent personality) and pursuit of pleasure and fun.

</p>


<h1>
	Theories of Causation
</h1>
<p>

The theoretical explanations of drug usage may be grouped broadly under
four heads: physiological, psychological, socio-psychological and sociological

According to the Physiological Theory, people take drugs because of
physiological aberrations and deficiencies or owing to bodily adaptation to
chemical properties of the drug. Mordones, Silkworth, Randolph and
Nimwich, are the scholars who have explained drug usage in terms of

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000463">463</pagenum>


<h1>
	page NO :463
</h1>


  <p>
	chemical reactions. But this theory, though widely accepted in the first two
deacdes of this century has been found inadequate ever since the psychological
and  sociological attributes of people who use drugs have been pointed out by
the empirical studies.
</p>
<p>

 The psychologists have explained drug use and drug dependence mainly
in  terms of Reinforcement Theory, Personality Theory, Power Theory, and
 the Weakened—Self Theory. In the Reinforcement Theory, Abraham Wilker
( Stark 1975: 102) has maintained that the pleasurable sensations produced by
1, reinforce their use. The Personality Theory has explained drug usage in
terms  of satisfying certain psychological needs or compensating for certain
psychological shortcomings. It refers to distinctive personality traits
associated  with drug dependence and emphasizes on ‘dependent personality’
,as the cause of drug dependence. Chein (1969: 13-30), Knight (1937: 538), and
Robert Freed Bales (1962: 157), the main supporters of this theory, hold that
people with dependent personalities require emotional support and attention
from others and failure to get it is substituted by drug usage. Chein 1n his
study  of narcotics in New York city found that persons with personality traits
 passivity, low self— esteem, little ability for self- direction, distrust of other
people , difficulty in handling frustrations and anxieties, inadequate masculine
identification and failure to resolve childhood conflicts, take to drugs.
McClelland (1977) challenging the Personality Theory has propounded
Power Theory and has explained drug usage (alcohol) as an expression of a
persons need for power. The light and occasional alcohol user gets a feeling of
enhanced social power while the heavy alcoholic gets a feeling of enhanced
personal power. In the Weakened Self Theory or Fear Theory, Peele and
Brodsky (1975) have maintained that drug addiction is a response to fear and
Insecurity to the conditions of modern life.

</p>
<p>
 All these psychological theories are incomplete in three ways: (1) they
fail to  explain how the personality traits, exclusive to drug users, are
develeped by the users, (2) they fail to explain why this syndrome leads to
drug or alcohol rather than to some other behaviour like suicide, and3 (3 ) they
fail to  identify personality traits exclusive to drug addicts or alcoholics and
why people with similar personality profiles do not take to drugs.

</p>
<p>
 In the Socio Psychological Labelling Theory, Becker (1963) and Erickson
(1965:21) have maintained that a person becomes a drug dependent or an
alcoholic under the pressure of being labelled as an addict or an alcoholic. But
it fails to explain why people first engage in drug behaviour that gets them
socially labelled as deviant addicts.

</p>
<p>
 The Sociological Theory holds that it is the circumstances or social
 environment which make people drug addicts. Sutherland’s Differential

</p>

<p>

Association Theory, when applied to drug usage, explains drug taking as
behaviour learnt from other persons, principally in small intimate  group
The Social Learning Theory, which is the expansion of Differential Association
Theory and the Reinforcement Theory, has been propounded by ‘ Akers and
Burgess. When the Reinforcement Theory merely assumes that
dependence is conditioned learning, the Social Learning Theory examines the
social sources of reinforcers that operate in the learning process;
reinforcement comes from association with persons favourably defining the
drug use. The Strain Theory focuses on the intense pressures put on individual
that cause them to deviate from the internalized norms. According to Merton
the source of this pressure is the discrepancy between goals and means. Those
who fail to achieve their goals through legitimate means become so frustrated
that they turn to the use of drugs and alcohol. Merton calls them ‘retreated
The Sub— cultural Theory holds that different groups within society are
socialized 1nto different sets of norms and deviance IS a judgment imposed
an outside group. Thus, what may appear to be deviant behaviour is really
conformity to a set of norms espoused by one group but rejected by another
When young people claim that adults are hypocritical to ban cannabis in a
society where alcohol drinking is socially permissible, and when adults
denounce cannabis as more dangerous substance than alcohol, two subcul
tures are fighting over whose norms shall prevail. Thus, drug use is the result
of clash in sub-cultural values of the young and the adults.
</p>
<p>

All the above sociological theories have their own perspectives. But each
theory leaves a number of questions unanswered. In my own Social“ Bond
Approach (1982: 120) I have explained drug abuse 1n terms of weakening of
social bond between individual and society due to maladjustment (in status)
unattachment (to social groups), and non—commitment (to social roles). It,
individual’s attachment to others, commitment to his social roles, and
adjustment to various situations that determine his values about what is good
or desirable, his behaviour patterns and his motives in deviating from the
dominant values of the culture. It is only by recognizing the role . and
analysing the nature of these three factors in particular or social bond in
general that we will be able to point out the structural or the institutional
measures to control drug abuse.

	Measures to Combat Drug Trafficking, Treating Addicts and ’
Preventing Drug Abuse
</h1>
<p>
	Over the last three-four decades, India has been facing the problem of?
increasing trafficking 1n drugs, particularly transit traffic in respect of heroin
and hashish from the Middle East region destined to western countries. As a!"

</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000465">465</pagenum>

<p>

result of this transit traffic, metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata,
Chennai have become vulnerable to drug trafficking. Almost daily we
 read news about drug trafficking. The narcotic authorities seize drugs worth
 crores  of rupees in almost every corner of the country. However, in recent
times Punjab has emerged as a major transit and destination point for drugs
coming g from Pakistan. Drug trafficking has reached a new high in the state.
The latest report of the Narcotic Control Bureau reveals that the seizure of
high priced heroin from Punjab was more than the total seizures in the
country. Till the end of March 2013, agencies seized nearly 814 kg of heroin
worth over Rs 35,000 crore whereas if all states put together the total seizure
come to only 700 kg. Most of the heroin seized in Punjab enters through
Pakistan as the state shares a 550-km long international border with it (Deccan
Hearald August 19, 2013). Even, the smugglers have not spared the country’s
capital and have made it the hub of drug trafficking in the country.
</p>
<p>

The ‘profits’ generated by drug trafficking are used in many ways: (i) for
financing politicians and developing lobbies in bureaucracy, judiciary, police,
prisons  and media; (ii) for investment in shell corporations that take over
legitimate business organizations; (iii) in purchasing arms for terrorism (it has
been found that militants in Kashmir and Punjab and LTTE and 181 organiza-
tions use drug trafficking as the main source of obtaining money for
purchasing  weapons); and (iv) intelligence agencies also take help of drug
traffickers  to assist terrorist activity. But, the fact is that all these ‘profits’ are
nothing but subversion of democratic processes.
</p>




<p>
In order to combat trafﬁcking in drugs, among the various measures
adopted by the government, one was the enactment of an Act in 1985, called
The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. It came into force on
November 14, 1985 and was amended in 1987 to tighten the noose around the
trafficker As stated earlier, it provides for a minimum punishment of ten
years' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh which may be extended to
20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2 lakh. In respect of repeat
offences the Act provides for a minimum punishment of 15 years’ rigorous
imprisonment. extendible up to 30 years and also a minimum fine of Rs 1.5 lakh
which may go up to Rs 3 lakh. The courts have been empowered to impose
fines exceeding these limits for reasons to be recorded in their judgement.
</p>
<p>

The  Act relates to drug addicts, too. It lays down imprisonment of one
year or fine or both for illegal possession in small quantity for personal
consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. It also
empowers the court to release an addict for undergoing medical treatment
for detoxification or de—addiction from a hospital or an institution
maintained- or recognized by the government. In keeping with this, the Act

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000466">466</pagenum>

	page NO:466
</h1>


<p>

requires the government to establish as many centres as it think fit for
identification, treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation and  social
reintegration of addicts.
</p>
<p>

The Ministry of Welfare, Government of India has also evolved  a
four-point action plan on drug abuse: (i) community- -based action for identify
cation, motivation, counselling, treatment and after-care, (ii) generation of
awareness about the consequences of drug abuse, (iii) training for service
providers, and (iv) association of non-governmental organizations in the
implementation of the programme and providing funds to them for the estab
lishment of counselling and de—addiction facilities. The National Institute of
Social Defence at one time was engaged in training functionaries of govern
mental and non-governmental agencies engaged in drug abuse prevention . In
thelast one decade, hundreds of deaddiction centres have come up all over the
country. Private nursing homes and government hospitals have opened new
wings to treat addicts.

</p>
<p>
	Some state governments have also undertaken programmes to impress
upon the university authorities to mount a special vigil against drinking and
drug abuse in hostels and campuses. In the voluntary sector too, a number of
counselling and guidance centres have been established in different cities
These centres are engaged in supplying information regarding the source of
treatment, coordinating with rehabilitation agencies, data collection, dissemi
nation of knowledge, liaison with enforcement agencies and psychological aid
by way of individual and group therapy.

</p>
<p>
	However, the drug de-addiction programme in our country has not made
any significant headway. However, for the purpose of reduction in drug
demands, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of
India has been implementing a scheme for prevention of alcoholism and
substance (drugs) abuse since 1985-86 under which 41 counselling centres and
401 drug de-addiction centres are functioning in the country for counselling
treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. The Ministry has also set up a
National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (N CDAP) in the National
Institute of Social Defence for capacity building and training of NGOs working
in the field. Besides, the Government of India has also constituted a National
Consultative Committee on De—addiction and Rehabilitation (NCCDR)! to
advise government both at the centre and in the states on the entire gamut of
issues related to prevention, de-addiction and rehabilitation of drug abusers.

</p>
<h1>
	Control over Drug Abuse
</h1>
<p>

The control over drug abuse can be made possible by adopting the following
measures: “

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000467">467</pagenum>


<h1>
page NO:467
</h1>


<p>

 Imparting education about drugs: The target population for educational
measures for prevention should be young college/ university students
particularly those living in hostels and away from the control of their
 parents, people living in slums, industrial workers, and truck drivers and
rickshaw pullers. The method of imparting education should be such
 that people involve themselves actively and there is a free exchange of
 valuable information. The type of education which would be more
 effective would be one whereby they are able to discard a good deal of
inaccurate and misleading knowledge about artificial euphoria and
acquire information which is more authoritative pertaining to physical
and psychological effects of the so- called mood modifying drugs, their
pharmacological properties and their medical uses. Parents have to play
”an important role in imparting education.

</p>
<p>
	Changing physicians’ attitudes: A change in the attitude of doctors in
prescribing too many drugs can go a long way in controlling the abuse of
drugs. The doctors have to show a greater care in not ignoring the side
effects of the drugs. Though drugs help many, yet there are dangers of
over- dependency. Once a patient gets a prescription from a doctor that
cures his ailment, he ceases to consult the doctor and continues to use the
 drugs indiscriminately or excessively whenever he suffers from the same
ailment. Thus, people come to depend more on medication than on
physician  which is a dangerous practice.

</p>
<p>
 undertaking follow- -up study of addicts treated under detoxification
programmes
</p>

<p>
	Giving deterrent punishment to policemen and other law enforcers found
working 1n collusion with drug peddlers.

</p>
<p>
	parents need to play a crucial role in controlling drug usage among their
 children Since parental neglect, over- hostility, rejection and marital
disharmony play an important role in perpetuating drug addiction,
parents  have to take more care in keeping the family environment
congenial and harmonious. Since addiction does not develop overnight
and  it involves a process of evolution of losing interest in studies, activ-
ities  and hobbies, indulging in irresponsible behaviour, irritability,

impulsive conduct, and having a dazed expression, parents can locate the
early signs by being alert and can make sure that the child withdraws
from  the habit.
</p>
<p>

In preventing drug abuse, the role of parents could be: (i) communicate
openly  with the children, listen to their problems patiently, and teach
them  how to handle the problems, (ii) take interest in children’s activ-
ities and their circle of friends, (iii) set an example for children by not

<p>

taking drugs or alcohol, (iv) keep track of prescribed drugs in home and
(v) learn as much as possible about drugs.
</p>
<p>
	6. The teachers too can help much in the prevention of drug abuse in the
following manner: (i) they can discuss dangers of drug abuse with the
students by talking informally and openly; (ii) they can keep themselves
interested in their students’ interests and activities; (iii) they can
encourage them to volunteer information of any incident of drug abuse
(iv) they can talk about the problems of adolescence and guide students
how to solve them; (v) they can help them in selecting career options and
setting goals; and (vi) they can encourage them to discuss their (students )
crises (of family, peer group, money, etc.) with them and help them to
the best of their abilities in facing these crises.
</p>
<p>
	To conclude, 1t may be said that drug abuse has become a growing there
to humanity. Drugs pose complex problems for law enforcement agencies
while drug traffickers and mafias play havoc with the social structure of our
country by wielding enormous power with ill- g—otten wealth and influence
Drug users who take drugs to seek instant remedies to their depression
frustration and anger suffer physically, economically, emotionally as well as
socially. Since 1991, June 26 is observed every year as an International Day
against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking to create awareness among drug
abusers as well as those who are engaged in waging war against drug .Our
main task 1n policy and action is not only to control supplies of drugs but also
to reduce demand for drugs. Prevention, treatment and rehabilitation all
require a positive and life- affirming campaign. Persuasion, motivation ,
coercion, compulsion and punishment are the measures all of which have to
be used so that drug abusers can be made to resist the temptation for drugs and
live a wholesome drug-free life. Families and voluntary organizations also can
play an important role in bringing back the recovered addicts into the
mainstream of social life. ,
</p>
<p>
	The United Nations adopted a Global Programme of Action in 1990 to
be implemented at the national, regional and global levels. Besides focusing on
enhanced communication, more effective exchange of information and
renewed commitment on the part of governments, it has suggested four
specific measures to be adopted: First, prevention should become an integral
element of drug control efforts worldwide. Second, multidimensional- drug
control programme involving all sections of government and society should
be formed. Third, the international drug control treaties should be ratified
and implemented as the basis of a global framework for co-operation. These
treaties can provide a legal foundation for effective drug control co-operation
Lastly, regional partnerships involving neighbouring governments should be

<p>
	AIDS (Acquired Immuno—Deficiency Syndrome) is a disease which is caused
by a virus called Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. This virus is fatal
and dangerous because it destroys the immune system (the capacity of the
body to fight diseases) 1n the human body and remains in the body for years
together without any visible symptoms. This virus is smaller than even
bacteria and 1s not observable even with the microscope. It can be transmitted
to other persons in a number of ways. AIDS 18 the last stage of infection in the
virus. It takes about eight to ten years between getting infected with HIV and
developing AIDS. No vaccine has been invented till today as a cure for AIDS
or for protecting people from the HIV, though some scientists claimed in
October 1995 that it was likely to be invented in the foreseeable future. And
three decades into the quest to develop a vaccine against the HIV, the success
is yet to be achieved.
</p>

<p>
	In the United States and some other countries like France, Belgium
Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, etc., the AIDS emerged 1n the 1980s
though the first case was detected in America in 1959. In India, the first case of
HIV infection was reported in May 1986 in Madras (now Chennai). The)
National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the Christian Medical College;
Vellore, started‘ screening operations’ in 1987 on the recommendations College
AIDS Task Force of Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi. It
screened 3,027 persons of high risk groups and detected a good number of
cases as being seropositive (Thomas, 1994: 12).

	HIV is currently spreading in the world at the rate of one new infection every
fifty seconds. The HIV/AIDS is not confined to any one class, community,
religion, age group, sex or profession, though according to the Indian Health
Organization (II-IO), women and children are believed to be more prone to it
( The Hindustan Times, April 7, 1995). The HIV infection is spread over all
regions and all groups.
</p>
<p>

 The enormity of the problem, and the concern generated by 1t globally,
was ,for the first time, realized 1n the last week of January 1988 when a
historic and unprecedented meeting took place 1n London. It was the World
Summit of Ministers of Health from 148 countries along with health experts
when a single disease syndrome was discussed at that level. The historic
London Declaration, emerging from the meeting stated: “In the absence at
present of a vaccine or cure for AIDS, the single most important component
of National AIDS Programme is information and education” (Parvi, 1992: 89).
</p>
<p>
	In mid-1992, the highest number of HIV infected cases were found in
American region (2. 77 lakh), followed by African region (1.51 lakh) and
South-East Asian region. In South-East Asia, up to June 1993, Thailand was
Leading with 1,589 cases, followed by 336 in India, 47 in Myanmar, 31 in
Indonesia, 24 in Sri Lanka, 18 1n Nepal and 2 1n Bangladesh (The Hindustan
Time, December 7, 1993). Global prevalence of HIV rose slightly in 2011,
according to figures published in the 2012 edition of the UNAIDS Global
Report. However, the number of new infections showed a slight decrease.
Last year 0.778 per cent of the world’s adult population was recorded as
suffering  from HIV, up from 0.775 per cent in 2010. New infections fell
year-on-year from 25, 88, 840 to 24,98, 754. Sub— Saharan remains the
worst -affected region by some way, although adult prevalence there fell from
4.91 per cent to 4. 85 per cent. Eastern Europe and the Middle East saw the
largest proportional increases in adult prevalence, while South and South-East
Asia saw the more pronounced drop. Table 1 shows the global prevalence of
HIV during  2002—11.
</p>

<p>
	In India, as stated earlier, the first cases of HIV were diagnosed among
Sex workers 1n Madras (now Chennai) 1n 1986. Since then, the country has
evolved from ‘low’ to ‘concentrated’ epidemic. In 2009, an estimated 2. 4
million people (aged 15—49) were living with HIV, slightly lower than the 2.5
million reported in 2001. However, India remains just behind South Africa
and Nigeria in numbers of persons living with HIV (UN AIDS 2010).
According  to National Aids Control Organization (NACO) report for
2009-10 women accounted for 38 per cent of people living with HIV while
children accounted for 4. 4 per cent.

<p>

As of February 2010, HIV had been mainly transmitted via sexual
course (87%). Additional routes of transmission include perinatal,
blood and blood products, infected needles and syringes and unspec
ified/ other routes of transmission.
</p>
<p>

The heterogeneous distribution of the HIV epidemic 1S evident as many
isolated pockets of high prevalence are identified 1n several districts of the
country. Overall, 108 districts 1n the country have HIV prevalence (>1%)in
lower- risk populations represented by women attending antenatal clinics
(AN Cs) whereas 87 districts have HIV prevalence (> 5%) in one or more of
the key affected populations. Sixty percent of people living with HIV were in
the six high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra
Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur.
</p>

<p>
	With a concentrated HIV epidemic, India’s HIV prevalence continues to
be high among key affected populations (6—8 times that of the general
population). High HIV prevalence among female sex workers 15 observed in
the south and rising trend 1s evident 1n the north-east .Higher HIV prevalence
among injecting drug users (IDUs) is also found 1n north-eastern states
However, it is localized 1n nature, and both rising and declining trends are
observed in different north-eastern states thus indicating the dual nature of thé
epidemic. In 2006, new sites of high HIV prevalence among IDUs were
identified in the states of Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and
Maharashtra. HIV prevalence among MSM is highest in the states of

<p>

 Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Goa,
Odisha, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Nationally, HIV prevalence is notably
higher among IDUs and men who have sex with men than among female sex
workers and other population groups. Still, sex work continues to act as the
most important source of HIV infections due to the large number of clients
becoming  infected by sex workers.
</p>
<p>
	Vulnerability and risk factors that could contribute to spread of the
epidemic in India include gender discrimination, stigma and discrimination,
and inadequate human resource and technical support that lead to slow
progress in the scale—up of prevention, care and support programmes.
Furthermore, there is a need to strengthen capacity and systems to effectively
implement certain HIV programmes such as a strategic information
management system, cohort tracking of ART, and ensuring quality data on
children affected or infected by HIV as well as operational and functional
governance structures.

<h1>
 High Risk Groups and Means of Transmitting the Virus

</h1>
<p>
 HIV infection is not contagious in the same sense as measles, chickenpox,
tuberculosis cholera, plague or small-pox. It mainly spreads through a sexual
rout and blood to blood contact. It may be said that HIV spreads mainly
through four sources: (i) sex with an infected partner— heterosexual as well as
homosexual, (ii) transfusion of blood and blood products infected with HIV,
injecting drugs with infected syringes or needles, and (iv) infected mother
unborn child, there being 30—50 per cent chance of transmission with
‘each delivery. As stated previously 1n India, HIV had been transmitted mainly
via sexual intercourse (8 7%), followed by unsafe blood transfusion, infected
needles syringes etc. It 15 thus a myth to believe that HIV infection spreads
through mosquitoes, holding/embracing/kissing each other, shaking hands,
coughing sneezing or spitting, sharing of public toilets, swimming pools,
sharing meals or eating from the same plates and cutlery, through clothes and
bedsheets ts, by attending the same school or workplace, etc. There are no
reports of doctors, nurses and other health care workers becoming infected
with HIV or developing AIDS from direct contact with a patient.
</p>
<p>
	According to UNICEF, India has a low HIV prevalence of only 0.34 per
cent Yet, in terms of individuals infected, it is home to the third largest
number of people living in the world. The vast majority (85. 6%) of HIV infec-
tions in India occur through sexual transmission, whereas nearly 5 per cent is
attributable to parent-to-child transmission. The epidemic disproportionately
affect women, accounting for 40 per cent of the total infections 1n the
counrty. And the epidemic 18 more pronounced 1n urban areas than rural
ones decreases with education levels.

We will now analyse the main sources pf transmission of virus, i.e.,
prostitutes, homosexuals, intravenous drug/ ddicts, blood donors, patho-
logical laboratories, and mothers with HIV infection giving birth to children.

Prostitutes (female sex workers) sell sex. There are believed to be about 20
lakh prostitutes distributed over 817 red-light areas in different parts in India
This does not include the number of call girls (Social Welfare, Delhi,June
1990). A large number of these prostitutes and call girls are infected with HIV
who pass on the infection to their customers. According to one estimate, the
level of HIV infection escalated from 1 per cent to 30 per cent among prosti
tutes in Mumbai in just three years—from 1989 to 1991. There is also a view
that prostitutes are at a lower risk of infecting their clients and at a higher risk
of getting infected by them. Therefore, along with targeting the preventive
programmes to prostitutes they should also cover their clients.

</p>
<p>
	Homosexuals in India are looked down upon with hostility unlike in the
United States, Britain, etc., Yet, it is a fact that the emerging institutions of gays
like ‘Mumbai Dost’ indicate a changing attitude towards the homosexual
Though homosexuality is generally considered a taboo subject in Indian society
but these long-held taboos about homosexuality are now beginning to break
The homosexuals are found 1n prisons, correctional reformatories, Rescue
Homes, etc. Outside these institutions also, they are found in thousands
risk of HIV infection through homosexuality 1s indeed very real.
</p>

<p>
	Drug addicts, who take drugs by injection, carry the possibility of
spreading the HIV infection through infected needles. The use of drugs is
spreading rapidly among students, industrial workers, truck and
auto-rickshaw drivers, and cycle-rickshaw pullers and people living in slum
areas. A good number of drug users gradually become so addicted to .
that they start taking them by self-injection. Sometimes the same syringes are
used by many drug—addicts increasing the possibility of spreading the HIV
infection. In Manipur, where 40 to 50 per cent of intravenous drug users are
HIV positive, many have been sent to jail, in some cases even by their own
parents. Among them are children of senior government officials as well as of
those in business, politics and academics (Seminar, August, 1992. 13).

</p>
<p>
	Blood donors too transmit the HIV infection. According to Central
Drugs Standard Control Organization, in November 2012, there were 2,545
licensed blood banks in our country, of which 981 were government banks
and the remaining 1,564 were private banks. There are some professional
blood donors also whose blood sometimes contains the HIV. When th
blood is transfused to patients without proper testing, the HIV is transmitted
The pathological laboratories too similarly transmit the HIV when they
supply blood without scientific testing. I

<p>

HIV positive pregnant women transmit the virus to the new-born
children  On one hand, about 65 per cent of the pregnant women remain
naemic and require blood transfusion and, on the other hand, the prostitutes
give birth to about 50 lakh children every year. They are thus doubly
vulnerable to transmitting the HIV.

</p>
<p>
	, Use of blade for shaving, particularly the one used by the barbers, is also
a risk factor in spreading the HIV.

</p>
<h1>
	Origin of the Pandemic
</h1>
<p>

Renee Sabatier (1988: 34-35) has pointed out three explanations of the origin
of HIV virus: One, it originated from an old human disease unknown to
science for the long time. Two, it has originated from species other than
human -beings, like apes, monkeys who suffered from natural virus. Three, it
 accidentally originated in laboratories while conducting experiments. Of
these three explanations, the first one is more acceptable to the scholars. It was
a young American physician who specialized in clinical immunology who
noticed way back in 1981 some extremely unusual features in a group of
otherwise healthy young homosexual men. This syndrome therefore was
initially called guy-related immunodeficiency or GRID (Parvi, 1992: 3). He
noticed that their bodies were being invaded by germs which are always
present in our environment but hardly ever attack normal human-beings.
Ordinarily these germs are seen in persons whose immune system is damaged
due to  the intake of some drugs or who have received radiation treatment
for cancer  His search alerted the entire scientific community and a French
virologist reported in 1983 the isolation of a new virus from patients who
suffered from this newly described disease. The isolation of this virus
causing the disease was further researched 1n the USA and other countries
by virologists and biologists and the virus was given a new name of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). These virus particles have a tendency of
moving from one to other human body. After invading the body, they enter
their target cells and remain there completely disguised and safe for years
together until they convert the infection into an active disease. The irony is
that it is very  difficult to detect asymptomatic HIV infected persons because
they feel and look normal and rarely visit doctors. Without blood test, there IS
no way to detect such an infection.
</p>

<p>
Stages in the  Development of the Disease
</p>

<p>
AIDS is a disease which 18 caused 1n a slow and gradual process. Theoretically,
four stages  have been identified in the development of HIV infection
(Malaviya, 1992 16—20):


</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000476">476</pagenum>




<h1>
	page NO :476
</h1>




<p>

1. Initial HIV infection: In this stage, with the entering of HIV virus in the
body, some people come to experience temporary serocon' version
disease within few weeks which resembles influenza or flu with
symptoms like fever, bodyache and headache. The immune system
the body produces antibodies (one kind of substance) which does not
destroy the HIV virus. After this, no characteristic develops for month
and years together; but during this period a person can spread the HIV
infection to others through sex, shared needles, blood transfusion, etc

2. Persistently enlarged glands: In the next stage of HIV infection, a person
develops enlarged but painless glands 1n the neck and armpits which are
free of any symptoms. They continue to persist for months and years
without producing any apparent ill- health. The early symptoms of
AIDS are fatigue, weight-loss, chronic diarrhoea, prolonged fever
cough, night sweats and lymph gland enlargement. These characteristics
are considered as first symptoms of AIDS in the developed countries
in the developing countries, since these symptoms cannot be  different
tiated from the ordinary infections, people do not think of going for
early treatment.
</p>
<p>

3. AIDS- related complex. In this stage, the virus damages the  immune
system which produces symptoms like attacks of diarrhoea, sweating
loss of weight and extreme weakness.

</p>
<p>
	4. Full- blown AIDS. This stage is reached after an average of nine to ten
years from the time of containing the HIV infection. The immune
system is totally destroyed and many infections and cancer are
produced. The patient becomes very weak and always feels tired. This
stage is easily recognized by doctors. A man does not survive for more
[than three to four years after this stage.
</p>
<p>
	Malaviya (1992: 18) 15 of the opinion that the progress of HIV infection
towards clinical illness varies from case to case. On an average, about 20per
cent of infected persons become symptomatic at the end of five years,50 per
cent at the end of ten years, and about 80 per cent will be sick at the end of
twenty years. " ‘

</p>
<p>
	How does one know whether one has contracted HIV infection? There
are certain tests for detecting the presence of this infection. When a person
comes to suffer from some disease, he develops what 13 called ‘pathogens
These pathogens are identified so that the immune system in man’s body can
destroy them through the internal defences. The HIV virus affects the
immune system and produces ‘antii-bodies The presence of these anti- bodies
in the body (called HIV anti-bodies) suggests infection, which can be
identified through blood samples.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000477">477</pagenum>

<p>
 Two most common tests are: one called ‘ELISA’ and other called
Westren Blot’ test. First test is simple and gives result within a few hours.
Second test is extremely difficult, expensive and time-consuming. It is done to
confirm the first test and is 50 times more expensive than the first one. These
days by carrying out the ELISA test by certain kits, the results obtained are
taken as a definite affirmation of HIV infection.

</p>

<h1>
	Implications
</h1>
<p>

It is difficult to visualize the devastating effects of the pandemic in our lifetime
and beyond. What initially appeared to be an illness confined to few
homosexuals has in one decade affected millions of men, women and children
worldwide. AIDS is not just a health problem; rather, it is a societal problem
with important social, cultural and economic dimensions. It threatens the
basic social institutions at the individual, family and community levels. Its
economic consequences are equally serious as it could claim up to half of
met. AIDS selectively, yet definitively, attacks people 1n their economic and
socially  most productive years and those responsible for the support and care
of other Consequently, when the earners are dead, they leave behind families
without any source of livelihood. Thus, not only the HIV infected people
initially face emotional trauma and later on social isolation and in the last one
or two years suffer from serious body problems but economically too they are
shattered. The victims are sacked from their jobs, disowned by their families
and communities, rejected by their friends, refused treatment by doctors,
turned down by schools, colleges and universities, and even imprisoned and
humiliated Their families too suffer economically, psychologically and
socially. After the bereavement of the young and married victims, their wives
suffer from the problems of widowhood and their children from the
problems of orphanhood.

</p>
<p>
	It is also argued that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS 1s linked with global-
ization,  which makes 1t easier for people to travel and may promote some risk
behaviours. It also creates much higher costs of health care for governments.

</p>
<h1>
	Caring for the Infected
</h1>

<p>

As stated  earlier, there were 2.4 million people living with HIV in India in
2009 These figures indicate that the management of this disease is a
stupendous task. The facilities presently available for the care of AIDS
patients are woefully inadequate. Soon after reporting of the first HIV/ AIDS
case in  the country, the government recognized the seriousness of the
problem and took a series of important measures to tackle the epidemic. A


</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000478">478</pagenum>

<p>

high-powered National AIDS Committee was constituted in 1986 and a
National AIDS Control Programme was launched a year later. In the initial
years the programme focused on generation of public awareness through mass
communication programmes, introduction of blood screening for transfusion
purposes and conducting surveillance activities in the epicentrec of the
epidemic. In 1992 the government formulated a multi-sectoral strategy for the
prevention and control of AIDS in India. It is implemented through the
National AIDS Control Organization (N ACO) at the national level and State
AIDS Cells at the state/ UT levels.
</p>

<p>
	As a result of these measures, awareness levels which were almost insig
nificant at the beginning of the epidemic have substantially increased in urban
areas even though the level of awareness in rural areas continues to remain
low. Some very successful intervention programmes among the high- risk
groups, like commercial sex workers, men having sex with men and injecting
drug users, were carried out through the dedicated involvement of NGOs
Emphasis has also been laid on control of STDs by strengthening STDs clinic
at the district level by early diagnosis and proper management of STDs
Besides, availability of good quality condoms through social marketing has
made a significant increase in the last few years.
</p>

<p>
	Several important actions have also been taken to ensure blood safety by
modernization and strengthening of blood banks, introduction of licensing
system for blood banks and gradual phasing out of professional blood donors
Introduction of component separation facilities has also helped in proper
clinical use of blood for transfusion. This has resulted in reduction of the
percentage of infections occurring through blood transfusion.
</p>
<p>

To protect the rights of the people living with and affected by HIV,a
HIV/ AIDS bill was drafted by the Union Health Ministry way back in 2006
but 13 still pending to be tabled 1n parliament for its passage.
</p>

<p>
	Counselling centres also need to be established where the therapist
counsellors may interact with the patients (HIV carriers as well as AIDS
patients), provide them psycho-social support and give them knowledge about
dosage of medicines, special diets, etc., and about the prevention of trans
mission. Jacob John (Seminar, August 1992: 43) is of the opinion that
counselling needs can be grouped into four broad areas: (1) pre-test counselling to those
for assessing the need for an HIV test and suggesting preventive strategies
against HIV infection to the individual; (ii) post-test counselling to those
whose results have been negative, reemphasizing change in behaviour
counselling to those who are known to be HIV positive to help them to
encounter emotional shock and depression and suggest strategies for care and

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000479">479</pagenum>

<p>

treatment and prevention of infecting others; and (iv) counselling the
full- blown patients who are in the last stage of the disease. Caring of these
patients with compassion could help them to die with dignity. Here
supporting the family of the patient would be equally essential as the members
would  be under considerable stress with their resources having already
stretched  to the limit.

</p>
<p>
	In performing his roles in various stages, the counsellor has to remain in
close contact with medical, social and other agencies. This calls for effective
training and skill. Naturally, a large number of counsellors cannot be
recruited  and trained within the available resources. Therefore, persons fit to
be trained for these roles could be amongst doctors, nurses, psychologists,
social workers and para-medical staff. It should also be remembered that
training in counselling requires an ongoing practical, supervised input with a
high trainer- trainee ratio.

<h1>

Link Between Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS
</h1>

<p>
Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) make 1t easier for HIV to pass from one
person to another. Chancroid, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and
trichomoniasis increase the risk of HIV transmission by two to nine times.
Nine but of eleven studies of syphilis and HIV infection found an association
between   the two. Syphilis increased with the risk of HIV infection three-fold to
eight- fold for heterosexual men. Herpes doubled the risk of HIV infection for
women and heterosexual men. Six studies found that chlamydia, gonorrhea and
trichomoniasis increase the risk of HIV transmission to women by three to five
times(Population Reports, Series L, No. 9, June 1993: 6).
</p>

<p>
	STDs are more often treated and cured. Countries (like Africa) which
do not treat STDs show more prevalence of HIV 1n heterosexual popula-
tions than  those (like the United States and Europe) which treat STDs. STDs
are nearly  as common as malaria—there being more than 250 million new
case each year, of which at least one million are HIV infected. It is,
therefore, essential that cases with STD symptoms are diagnosed 1n their
early stages  and controlled with better drug supply through primary care
clinics.Thus,  following measures in this connection can improve care for
patients With STDs: (i) conduct surveys to identify the level of untreated
infection (ii) make clinics hospitable, (iii) diagnose and treat patients in one
visit (iv) offer sympathetic and helpful counselling, (v) conduct educational
campaigns about STDs, and (vi) provide services for high-risk population.
Measure  like these will prevent the spread of HIV infection and AIDS 1n
large number of cases.

<h1>
Role of Voluntary Organizations	 page NO :480
</h1>


<p>


The task being gigantic and the work that needs to be done for the patients
infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS for many years being unprece
dented in terms of scale and efforts, government alone cannot be expected to
take up the total control programme. Voluntary organizations too, have to be
involved in ‘behaviour change’ programme. The World Health Organization
(WHO) also has emphasized its need. But, it appears that, at present, the
voluntary organizations are unwilling and consider themselves unable to
respond to this need of associating themselves with efforts to contain AIDS
Knowing that the origin of HIV infection is related to inadequate health care
subordination of women, illiteracy, poverty and such other traditional
problems, the voluntary organizations can surely address themselves to these
social realities. Focusing on the social factors influencing the vulnerability of
people to HIV infection, the voluntary organizations can provide infor
mation, services and other social support systems to people in danger of
catching the disease. Before catching the infection, knowledge in the spread of
HIV infection can be imparted by community-based social workers. It is well
recognized that women are much more vulnerable to HIV infection than
men. The reasons for this are not medical but are rooted in a social
environment that actually promotes this vulnerability. Take the case of a
prostitute. She is not in a position to ask her client for adopting precautionary
measures. Knowledge imparted by voluntary organizations to such women
for safe sex will create an environment in which these women can make
choices and act on them. The capacity to motivate and sustain the
involvement of the vulnerable people will determine the success of the
voluntary organizations. After being infected with virus, the need for psycho
logical and social support is as crucial as medical support and non- government
organizations can easily provide these services. When lakhs of people suffer
from a certain disease, total dependence on the medical system will be unwise
and will surely result in a failure. There is a simultaneous need to prepare
communities to be able to cope with caring for the diseased people and to final
resources for this within the community itself. The voluntary organization
can surely make genuine effort towards this support system. Besides helping
the patients, the voluntary organizations can also help the children, families
and other dependents of the sufferers who become victims of isolation and
discrimination.

 <p>


later when the first AIDS case appeared in Madras (now Chennai) in 1986,
many states believed that it would not reach them. In 1996, when officially it
was stated that there are more than 1,000 AIDS cases and about 22,000 HIV
carriers, and unofficially it was estimated that there were lakhs of HIV carriers
in the country and when there is a projection that by the end of this century,
the  largest population of HIV carriers in the world (about one -fourth of the
world HIV population) will be in India, our governments —central and
state are  yet to enunciate clear-cut strategies to combat the spread of the
virus. It is not likely that we will have a vaccine or a cure for AIDS in the near
future though serious efforts are constantly being made in this direction, its
spread therefore, can only be controlled through preventive education for
behavioural  change.
</p>
<p>
	some measures have been suggested for protecting and preventing the
AIDS and  HIV infection. These are: One, since sex with infected person is the
highest risk factor in AIDS, the greatest need is to educate people to have ‘safe
sex by  using condoms and avoiding multiple sexual partners. This could be
done through TV, radio, newspapers and other mass media. The required
awareness can be produced through course content in the educational institu-
tions too AIDS Advisory Centres may also be established for imparting the
required knowledge to the people. Seminars, symposia, and workshops too
can be organized from time to time for 1mparting the required knowledge.
Two be  training is necessary for doctors and nurses so that they can impart
some knowledge to the patients regarding the symptoms of HIV infection and
AIDS. Thee, persons suffering from STDs are also a significant risk factor in
HIV  transmission. Though data are limited, there appears to be a high
incidence  of STDs among tribal poor, rural poor and urban slum-dwellers 1n
India and  these conditions do provide a fertile ground for the spread of the
5virus. Reported  rates of HIV infection among STD cases have triplicated from
1986 to 1996. Unlike AIDS, STDs can be treated. Hence, programmes for the
prevention  and control of STDs should be given high priority. Four, blood or
blood product must be tested for HIV before transfusion. Five, the HIV tests
should be made free and confidential for persons who indulge 1n the high-risk
activities and who may themselves want to know whether they are HIV
infected or not and for persons who receive a transfusion of blood not
properly screened for HIV infection. However, testing for diagnosis raises
several ethical problems. Should individuals at risk for HIV be encouraged to
take the test) How forceful should such encouragement be? How should
those who are tested be counselled? Can and should the test results be kept
confidential Suppose a pregnant woman comes for a test and is  found
infected with HIV. Should she be compelled to go for abortion or can she be

</p>

<p>
	permitted to continue her pregnancy because the studies have demonstrated
that there is the risk of only 25 to 50 per cent of transmission of HIV from
mother to the child. These issues raise nagging dilemmas that cannot be easily
resolved. There IS an urgent need for framing of policies on all these issues
after careful thinking. Six, doctors should ensure that injecting equipment is
sterilized. As far as possible, the use of disposable syringes should be
encouraged. Seven, condoms should be freely distributed or supplied at cheap
rates in red- light areas to prostitutes. Eight, drug users should be persuaded to
stay away from intravenous drug use. Lastly, voluntary organizations should
help spread knowledge on AIDS to different vulnerable groups throug
innovative and community— -based approaches.
</p>
<p>

Doctors and Health Care Centres 1n our country are prejudiced about
HIV/ AIDS with the result that patients are denied admission in hospitals and
neglected in treatment by not regularly visiting them in the isolated wards
This has resulted in panic reactions. Such reactions are counter- productive
Such effective strategies have to be designed and developed which can help the
HIV/ AIDS victims to overcome fear and hysteria. Counselling families
individuals in neighbourhood, and members of social- support network is also
an important need because eventually they have to bear a major responsibility
for the sick and the survivors.
</p>
<p>

AIDS and HIV infection are transmitted mainly through behaviour
which is private, secret and often hidden. As such, the infection or even the
suspicion of infection leads to stigma and discrimination. Discriminatory
practices have targeted persons that are subsumed under ‘high risk’ group
like prostitutes, drug users and homosexuals. These persons are categorized
according to the presumed risk that they are identified with. Such categori
zation not only challenges the rights of the individuals but the categonizzed
persons are also victimized under the guise of preventing AIDS. This under
mines efforts to reach these persons and seek their active cooperation in the
fight against AIDS.
</p>
<p>

Finding funds to fight AIDS 15 a serious problem 1n our country because
the potential costs are staggering. On one hand, diverting funds from other
problems to AIDS control may distort health priorities, while on the other
hand, if proper funds are not made available, the economic consequences may
be more devastating. In 1990, India had received a loan of 85 million dollars
from the World Bank for AIDS control but will these funds suffice. Aloge
with. finding more sources of funds, the political will has to be generated, join
action has to be mobilized and the sustainable strategies have to be located for
creating necessary awareness. The efforts made so far in dealing with the HIV
infection/ AIDS pandemic cannot be described as totally inadequate. A

beginning has been made. Today is better than yesterday and tomorrow is
what we look forward to. Certain issues can be dealt with legally by enacting
laws (say, by making blood screening mandatory, keeping HIV patients’
status  confidential, prescribing anti— discriminatory provisions, making it
obligatory for doctors not to deny services to HIV/ AIDS patients, and so on)
and certain issues can be faced socially by creating the required social
environment and providing certain social services.

Terrorism page NO:484

<p>

Terrorism has pushed the world into a perilous new age of insecurity. In
India, we have been facing this for more than four decades. Earlier, we were
faced with the problem of insurgency in northeast India while dealing with
the Naga and the Mizo rebels and the terrorism of the Naxalites in Bengal
Today, terrorism is perceived as a problem capable of destabilizing not only
both the developed and the developing countries. What has made terrorism
significant instrument for achieving desired goals and ends by persons using
the terrorist techniques are factors like conviction in the purity of the cause
fanatical loyalty, desire for self- sacrifice, a sense of absolutism, and financial
and material support from abroad.

<h1>
	The Concept
</h1>

<p>
	The words terrorism, insurgency, civil war, revolution, guerrilla war, intimi
dation and extremism are most often interchanged and used very loosely
What 15 common in all 18 ‘violence’. Terrorism 15 an organized system of
intimidation. It IS broadly defined as “violent behaviour designed to generate
fear 1n the community, or a substantial segment of 1t, for political purposes
It 13 also defined as “a method whereby an organized group or party seeks to
achieve its avowed aims chiefly through the systematic use of violence
(Encyclopedia of Social Sciences).
</p>
<p>

The UN General Assembly Resolution 49/60, adopted on December
9, 1994, contains a provision describing terrorism: “Criminal acts intended
or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of
persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance

<p>
	Justifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical,
logical, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked
justify them.”
</p>
<p>
     According to the UN Security Council Resolution 1566 (2004), the term
'terrorism’ includes criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with
the ”intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the
purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of
persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government
or an intemational organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.
      The United States has defined terrorism under the Federal Criminal
code. Title 18 of the United States Code defines terrorism and lists the
crimes associated with terrorism. The Section 2331 of Chapter 113(B),
defines terrorism as: “...activities that involve violent... or life-threatening
acts... that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any?
state and... appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian
population; (ii) to inﬂuence the policy of a government by intimidation or
coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction,
assassination, or kidnapping; and...(C) occur primarily within the territorial
jurisdiction of the United States...” According to the US Patriot ACt of 2001
terrorist activities include:
threatening, conspiring or attempting to hijack airplanes, boats, buses
or other vehicles;
threatening, conspiring or attempting to commit acts of violence on
any “protected” persons, such as government officials; and
any crime committed with “the use of any weapon or dangerous
device,” when the intent of the crime is determined to be the endan-
germent of public safety or substantial property damage rather than
for mere personal monetary gain.
</p>
<p>
The European Union defines terrorism for legal/ off1c1al purposes in
Article 1 of the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism (2002). This
provides that terrorist offences are certain criminal offences set out in a list
comprised largely of serious offences against persons and property which
given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an interna-
tional organization where committed with the aim of: seriously intimidating a
population; or unduly compelling a government or international organization
to perform or abstain from performing any act; or seriously destabilizing or
destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social struc-
tures of a Country or an international organization.
   Terrorist acts are directed against persons who, as individual agents or
representatives of authority, interfere with the consummation of the objectives

of such a group. A ‘terrorist’ is one who imposes the punishment meted out by
his/ her organization upon those who are held to interfere with the revolu-
tionary programme. The terrorist does not merely threaten; death or
destruction is part of his/ her programme of action. If he/ she is arrested, he/she
does not try to prove his/ her innocence but he/ she spreads his doctrines.
</p>
<p>
	Though the long—term objectives of terrorism, insurgency and revolution
are similar, that is, overthrow of the existing regime or order, but the
short-term objectives and strategies or methodology may be quite different.
</p>
<p>
	One View is that the above definitions refer only to that terrorism which
is practised by the ‘opponents of the state’. There is another terrorism which is
practised by the ‘state apparatus’. The above deﬁnitions do not include the latter
type of terrorism. The greatest practitioners of the art of terrorism, like Hitler,
Stalin, Mao, Yahya Khan, Mussolini and Franco, cannot be termed as 'terror-
ists’ with these definitions in mind. Terrorism practised by the state refers to
violence based on extra-legal methods. It may, however, be clarified that all
violence practised by the state is not terrorism. In fact, an organized state has
sometimes to use violence for certain objectives. The democratic states generally
use legal apparatus to achieve their objectives; it is only the totalitarian states
which employ terror. But then all totalitarian states are not terrorists. Similarly,
at times, the democratic states can also resort to using terror.
</p>
<p>
	The common definition of terrorism does not include all types of
violence used by the organized groups. That violence which is motivated by
consideration of pure personal aggrandizement is excluded from terrorism
This excludes common organized crimes like dacoity and robbery. Howeever,
all murders and dacoities organized by ideological groups like the Naxalites
fall within the purview of terrorism.
</p>
<p>
	Terrorism has also been differentiated from intimidation and insurgency
In ‘intimidation’, the intimidator merely threatens injury to collect a ransom
but in ‘terrorism’ and‘ insurgency, ’the terrorists and the insurgents actually use
violence. Terrorism is not a fight between individuals but a struggle between
social groups and political forces. It has little to do with intimidating individuals
as individuals. The terrorists punish those individuals whom their organization
considers guilty of interfering with their programme aimed at the removal of
the undesired social or governmental system. According to Wilkinson (1974),
terrorism in politics is a weapon of blackmail, coercion, and imposition of
minority will against and upon a majority decision.
</p>
<p>
	Terrorism is different from ‘mob violence’ also. The latter is unplanned
and uncontrolled, guided by some immediate motivation which may not even
be rational and is not based on any precise programme. The former has a
definite goal and is planned. It aims at demoralizing a governmental authority
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000487">487</pagenum>

<p>
	and undermining its power. However, at times, terrorism may also use mob
violence as its method.
      The difference between terrorism and insurgency is that an insurgent has
the support of a large section of the local population while a terrorist need not
have such support. Again, an insurgent is a national of a country which is in
revolt against the constitutional government of his country and fights to
overthrow the government by guerrilla warfare. The terrorist may or may
not be a national of the country in which he operates (Saxena, 1985: 14—35).
      The above definitions enable us to put forth six basic definitional
components of terrorism. These are: (1) terror purpose (that is, creating fear 1n
the minds of the primary target), (2) instrumental or immediate victims, (3)
primary targets (population or broad groups and others), (4) an outcome of
death to instrumental targets and damage to or destruction of property, (5 )
violence, and (6) political purpose.
      Terrorism appears in many forms—from planting a crude, home-made
bomb, hand—grenade or other explosive in a shopping centre, a railway
station, a bus-stand and a bus, a train or an aeroplane to kidnapping and assas-
sination of important personalities. The main aim of terrorists is to wreak
havoc, upon those whom they regard as obstacles or enemies or oppressors.
</p>
<h1>
Characteristics
</h1>

<p>
Terrorism is characterized by a technique of perpetrating random and brutal
intimidation, coercion, or destruction of human lives and property, and used
intentionally by subnational groups operating under varying degrees of stress,
to obtain realistic or illusory goals. The main characteristics of terrorism are:
it is against the state or community,
it has a political purpose,
it is illegal and unlawful,
it aims at intimidating and creating impact of fear and panic not only
for the victim but also for the people at large, caused for the purpose
of coercing or subduing,

it is accompanied by a feeling of impotence and helplessness on the
part of the masses,

it stops rational thinking,

it leads to reaction of fight or flight, and

it Contains arbitrariness in violence as victims’ selection is random or
indiscriminate.
</p>
<h1>
Objectives
</h1>
<p>
The goals of terrorists may vary from movement to movement but the main
objectives of terrorism are the same in all terrorist movements. These are: (1)
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000488">488</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>
cause the regime to react and also to overreact. Reaction is required to compel
the government/ community to concede the demand of the terrorists. Overre-
action or indiscriminate reaction is required to demonstrate the repression by
the regime so that the people are alienated and their sympathy is achieved.
The security forces used by the government (because of overreaction) to
protect the VIPs and the public installations will reduce the amount of
security forces available to protect the general public, which will enhance
their feeling of insecurity and helplessness and also increase the sense of terror
amongst them; (2) mobilize mass support and urge potential sympathizers to
greater militancy, or increase the involvement of more people. In a foreign
territory, the objective of terrorist activity is to inﬂuence people rather than
win friends. The chief objective in these places is a show of strength and to
demonstrate the incapacity of the regime to protect people and maintain
order; (3) eliminate opponents and informers and remove threat to the
movement and also ensure obedience of the followers; and (4) give publicity
or magnify their cause and strength.
</p>
<p>
	According to Baljit Singh (cited 1n Alexander and Finger, 1977:8), the
overall objectives of terrorism are: (i) to gain popular support, (ii) to disrupt and
destroy the military and psychological strength of the regime, and (iii) to break
internal stability and check growth. If the premise is accepted that political
terror primarily aims at the psyche rather than at military hardware, the killing
of selected important but unpopular public officials and politicians may boost
the terrorists’ morale, create sympathy among the people and provoke the
regime to adopt repressive measures that further alienate the people.
</p>
<p>
	Jay Mallin (1971: 9) has suggested five basic short-term objectives of
political terrorism. (1) morale building within the ranks, (ii) advertising the
movement, (iii) disorientation and psychological isolation of the people, (iv)
elimination of opposing forces, and (v) provocation of the government.
</p>
<h1>
Origin and Development
</h1>
<p>
Political terrorism as an instrument of power came of age during the French
Revolution of 1793. Terror incorporated two facets in this Revolution: a state
of anxiety within a group, and the tool that induced fear and violent acts
aimed at inﬂuencing political behaviour of the state. After the French
Revolution, political terrorism did not score any significant success until 1921,
when the IRA in Ireland used it against the British. Following the World War
II (i.e., after 1939), political terrorism re-emerged on the international scene.
Besides India, it was used in Algeria, Cyprus and Kenya for political
independence through activities including intimidation, sabotage, abduction
and killing.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000489">489</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:489
</h1>

<p>
	  During the 1960s, political terrorism entered another phase. According
Baljit Singh (cited in Alexander and Finger, 1977: 7), the two most signif-
quantitative changes in terrorism during 19605 were: its trans-national
character and its emergence as a self-sufficient strategy, that is, terrorists
attempted to operate independently of the larger political arena. This was
made possible through a revolution in communication and modern urban
civilization. Between 1969 and 1975, more than forty countries were involved
in terrorist activities.
</p>
<p>
	 Alexander and Finger (1977:xi) are of the opinion that the major reasons
for terrorism lie in the very nature of modern civilization itself and are
inherent in the modern industrial system. They have given following causes
for the origin and development of terrorism:
</p>
<p>
The present complex technological society is extremely vulnerable to
unsuspected and ruthless attacks of terrorism because transportation
centres, communication facilities, factories and agricultural fields cannot
always be protected against the random acts of dedicated and determined
terrorists.
Highly sophisticated weapons like missiles, and remote controls are now
relatively easy to obtain for various terror movements. In future, the
terrorist groups will probably have access even to chemical and nuclear
weapons and instruments of death and destruction.
With modern warfare capabilities, the ‘powerless’ terrorist groups have
been transformed into subnational groups with formidable strengths,
capable of creating states within states, thereby undermining the ability
of legitimate governments to rule or to survive (the LTTE in Sri Lanka,
the Khalistan Commandos and Kashmir militants in India and the PLO
in Israel are some examples of such strong sub-national groups).
Communication and transportation opportunities have enabled an
international network of terrorism to develop with a certain degree of
centralized organizational structure. Collaboration among ideologically
linked groups and among those with common political interest has
developed relationships involving financing, training, supply of combat
materials, organizational assistance and joint attacks. This pattern of
'comradeship’ is inevitably expanding the areas of international violence.
Through revolution in communications, terrorists are able to target
their violence not only against immediate victims but also direct it at a
wide audience as well for psychological intimidation and blackmail. The
media coverage also exports the terroristic techniques and inspiration to
other terrorist groups.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000490">490</pagenum>

<h1>
Page:no490
</h1>
<p>
	    In addition to above factors, the other factors which have substantially
contributed to terrorism are: the weak nations’ will to weaken the strong
nations, which motivates them to support the subnational groups of strong
nations in their terroristic activities; financial support of rich non-residents to
terrorist groups on religious and cultural basis; feasibility of using smuggling
and drug trafficking methods by the terrorists and, thus, getting money for
purchasing modern weapons; confrontations between the East and the west
as well as between the ideologies of the Leftists and the Rightists; the rise in
religious, linguistic, ethnic and national consciousness of groups throughout
the world; the feelings of deprivation and frustration among the minorities
struggling for their liberation and a legitimate right to self-determination and,
the growth of opposition by citizens to repressive regimes and dictators ruling
their countries.
        The strategies and tactics employed by political terrorists are generally
directed at three groups: the people, the regime in power and the terrorist
organization itself.
</p>
<h1>
Perspectives
</h1>
<p>
Terrorism has been perceived by different scholars with different perspec-
tives. We may identify four such perspectives: historical, political, sociological
and legal (Chart 1).
      The historical perspective focuses on the origin, development and quali-
tative changes in different phases in terrorism. Baljit Singh (cited in Alexander
and Finger, 1977. 5—17) is one scholar who has used this approach to analyse
terrorism.
      The political perspective Games Muller) perceives political terrorism as a
political violence movement organized by an organized political group(s)
either at national or at international level.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000491">491</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:491
</h1>
  The legal perspective concentrates on state laws as well as international law
for cooperation among various states in dealing with international terrorism.
       In the sociological perspective, in analysing terrorism, Jordan Paust
(Alexander and Finger, 1977: 19) focuses on: (i) the types of participants engaged
in terrorism as terrorists, targets, victims, and so forth, (ii) the objectives of the
participants, (iii) the situations of actual interaction, (iv) the type of resources at
the disposal of each type of participant, (v) the strategies of terror utilized
(killing, kidnapping, bombing, looting and hijacking) and, (vi) the outcome of
the terroristic process (deaths, injuries, destruction of property, etc”)
<h1>
Mass Support
</h1>
<p>
What is the nature and extent of mass support to the ideology, goal and
methodology of the terrorists? Many a time it happens that the masses accept
a particular ideology but not the goal, or they accept the goal but not the strat-
egies of the proponents of terrorism. Even when one agrees with the goal, he
may not support the movement or may not go beyond a certain point. Thus,
the quantity and quality of mass support varies from one terrorist movement
to other terrorist movement. Verma (Tiwari, 1930: 233) has given some
indicators of the characteristics of mass support. These are: supporting the
ideology or cause, agreeing with methodology, providing money and
material, nonviolent participation in rallies, supplying arms and ammunition,
providing shelter or harbouring, vocal or written (in media, etc.) support, and
active participation in movement (violent support). Verma has also arranged
these indicators in ascending order and has given three types of civil strife:
terrorism, insurgency and revolution. According to him, terrorism is charac-
terized by very little mass support but the participants go all the way from
ideology to extreme violence. Insurgency or guerrilla warfare is characterized
by the small number of 1nsurgents or guerrillas supported by a very large
segment of population. This happens when the cause is removal of colonial
rule or resisting a foreign ruler. Revolution is characterized by much larger
number of participants and mass uprising.
</p>
<p>
	   Terrorism in India has attracted youngsters more, particularly the
unemployed, the misguided and the idealistic youth. As long as there are
causes which arouse intense emotions, the idealistic youth will be led to have
romantic visions of terrorism for a cause. When a nation loses Its purpose
owing to a corrupt leadership with vested 1nterests, frustrations and depriva-
tions will lead the aggressive youths to extremist tendencies like Naxalism, or
parochial issues in Punjab, or religious lssues in Kashmir. Some examples of
terrorist groups which have attracted the youth outside India are: the IRA in
Ireland, Black Septemberists in Jordan, Baader Meinhof in Germany, LTTE
in sri lanka  and the Red Army in Japan.

<h1>
Support Base
</h1>

<p>
The success of terrorism depends to a large extent upon its support base which
includes not only the political and social support but also support by money,
weapons and training. Terrorists obtain money from different sources like
donations and taxes from people, through bank robberies, by smuggling and
selling drugs, and collecting ransom for hostages and hijacked planes.
Weapons are often looted from people or snatched from police station or
purchased from abroad. For example, the PLO rebels acquired weapons from
the Arab states, China and the Soviet Union. The Khalistani terrorists got and
Kashmiri militants are still getting both training and weapons from Pakistan.
A state like Tamil Nadu in South India has once again become active after
1993—94 ethnic violence in Sri Lanka. The ethnic linkage of the Tamils
provides local sympathy for the Sri Lankan Tamils in India. The militant
activities of the LTTE have become a nuisance for one or two of our southern
states. It has now been established that the LTTE militants were responsible
even for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on May 21,1991.

Terrorism 1n India
</h1>
<p>
	India is among the 25 least peaceful nations to live 1n, according to the Global
Peace Index, 2013. The country was placed 141 among 162 nations having lost
more than two lives a day or a staggering 799 persons to internal conﬂicts in
2012 (Times of India, June 12, 2013).
      Terrorism 1n India 15 essentially the creation of politics. The four types
of terrorism India had/ has to face are: Khalistan-oriented terrorism in Punjab,
militants’ terrorism in Kashmir, Naxalite terrorism in Bengal,
Bihar/Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, and the ULFA
terrorism in Assam. Earlier we had faced this problem in Nagaland (1951),
Mizoland (1966), Manipur (1976), Tripura (1980) and (of Gorkhaland) in
Bengal (1986). The Sikh terrorism in Punjab was based on a dream of a
“theocratic state through secession”, the Nagaland and the Mizo terrorism
was based on the “identity crisis”, the Manipur and Tripura terrorism was
based on “th grievance situation,” and the Naxalite terrorism in Bengal,
Bihar/Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh is based on “class enemity”. There are,
at present, as many as 66 terrorist/ separatist groups active across the country,
according to the Union Minister of State for Home. At least five of these
outﬁts, viz., Laskar—e—Taiba, India Mujahideen, Hizbul Mujahideen,
Harkat-ul-Jihadi and Al Badr, have presence across the hinterland, particularly
Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Rajasthan. The similar
number of groups are operating in Jammu 8C Kashmir, with LeT and Hizbul
Mujahideen topping the list, ten are active in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland

the list does not include the left-wing extremist outfits like the CPI (Maoist)

</p>
<h1>
Terrorism in Punjab
</h1>
<p>
Sikh terrorism in Punjab was based not on “grievance situation,” but on
identity crisis of Sikhs,” or on the idea of a “theocratic state” through
secession and partition of the country. It (terrorism) entered a dangerous
phase in 1984—85. Earlier, during 1982—83, scores of innocent people, mostly
Hindus were killed in a reckless spree. In the later phase, along with Hindus,
sikhs were also killed. Places of worship were turned by the militants into
arsenals. There were not only many bomb blasts in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar
pradesh which took a heavy toll of life but there were conspiracies also to kill
VIPs. Sant Longowal, President of the Akali Dal, was murdered inside a
gurdwara in August 1985, while the Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh was
KIlled by a human bomb in his car in 1995.
</p>
<p>
    The massacre of selected non-Sikh passengers travelling by bus, blowing
up the Air India Boeing ‘Kanishka’ and killing nearly 300 innocent Indians,
the murder of 11,543 political leaders, journalists, and even innocent people,
and of 1,667 cops between 1984 and 1992, the killing of 114 Hindu train
passengers at the Buddowal railway station near Ludhiana in June 1991, the
looting of banks both in and outside Punjab, the killing of 24 candidates
contesting elections in June 1991 (later postponed to February 1992) at the
rate of one candidate a day, were all acts of terrorists highly condemned by
everybody. The death toll in Punjab, including that of civilians, security
forces and militants between 1981 and 1993 is shown in Table 1.
</p>
<p>
    The imperialist forces interested in balkanizing India and in weakening,
destabilizing  and even disintegrating our country, had been supporting,
encouraging and abetting the demand of Khalistan. The internal factor which
helped the terrorists in Punjab was the spread of Hindu communalism. The
Hindu in communalists held the entire Sikh community responsible for the
crimes of terrorists. They kept on harping on the slogan of revenge and retali-
ation. Their (communalists’) assertion that ”Sikhs are Hindus” provided the
argument to the separatists that unless there is Khalistan, Sikhism will be
absorbed in the Hindu religion. The anti-Sikh riots in Delhi at the time of the
assassination of Mrs. Indira Gandhi had resulted in killing of more than 300
sikhs. the fact that no action was taken against those who were involved in
these riots was exploited by the extremists in Punjab to spread terrorism and
gather mass support for their action.

	    The strategies and tactics adopted by the Khalistan-oriented terrorists
were: (i) undermining the authority of the administration by issuing their
own orders and demonstrating their strength by killing the deviants, (ii)
projecting themselves as the defender of Sikhs and Sikh religion, (iii) killing
innocent people, looting banks and shops and creating terror, (iv) forcing the
Hindus of Punjab to migrate to other states and providing opportunities to
sikhs from other states to migrate to Punjab, and (v) developing a nexus with
smugglers for raising funds in Punjab.
    After the measures adopted by the government and the police between
march 1993 and March 1994, terrorism in Punjab has now almost been
controlled though there still exist some Sikh groups that keep on asking for
separate Sikh state. The killing of the Chief Minister of Punjab and 15 others
in a bomb blast on August 31,1995 was described by some people as returning
of the ghosts of Punjab’s terrifying past. Some people feel that the train
explosion near Ambala of Jhelam Express going to Jammu on December 2,
19% Which killed 12 people and injured 31 people is a pointer to the return of
terrorism in Punjab. Others see it as a renewed ISI initiative to revive
militancy both 1n Punjab and Kashmir. But there are other people who
contend that terrorism in Punjab cannot re-erupt. Today, the spirit of the
people in Punjab has been fatigued by terrorism. There is no anger but just a
gnawing fear that has become a state of mind. In ‘Babey Raj’ (the local
parlance for militants), the people had internalized fear and had learnt to live
with it. The word of the terrorists was like a command for the villagers. The
poor villagers followed these commands for the sake of their safety, for the
safety of their children, for the safety of their fields, and for the safety of their
cattle, shops and property. The agony of people in Punjab was that not only had
the terrorists progressively held the state to ransom but the administration by its
corrupt tentacles had destroyed the faith of the people 1n the system and the
highhandness of the police raj seemed to grow by leaps and bounds. In the face
of such anarchy, the people’s anguish was silenced.
</p>
<h1>
Naxalism
</h1>
<p>
	Among the many threats that India faces to its security, Naxalism has been
identified as the biggest one. It has continued to defy the state for longer than
any other  uprising in post-independence India. The Naxalite movement
started in West Bengal in early seventies and has since then spread to rural
areas of central and eastern India. It got impetus in 1969 when CPI (ML) was
born at the mstigatiom from China which was interested 1n weakening India.
The theoretical backing for Naxalite thought came from the Ninth Congress
of the Communist Party of China held in April 1969, when Mao’s thoughts
</p>

<p>
were declared to be the highest stage of Marxism-Leninism. Using these
thoughts, the Naxalite leader, Charu Mazumdar had declared "China's
Chairman 18 our Chairman. From West Bengal, the Naxalite movement
spread to Bihar to fight for the landless labour. However, Mazumdar's call for
annihilation of class enemies did not get much response from the peasantry
class and the educated middle class, though many idealistic young Naxalite
men and women enjoyed killing landlords, moneylenders and police officers
The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India describes thé objectives
of Naxalites (also called Maoists) as destroying “state legitimacy ... with the
ultimate object of attaining political power by violent means”. They are also
considered a terrorist organization under the 1967 Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act of India.
</p>
<p>
	Naxalites have been attacking police establishments and public infra-
structures causing insecurity and instability to the area. Between 2006 and
2010 alone, in nearly 9,000 incidents, 3,000 1nnocent people killed. The police
also killed about 400 insurgents and arrested about 6,000. The movement also
got discredited because professional criminals joined the movement. After
1972, the Naxalite movement spread from West Bengal and Bihar to Andhra
Pradesh, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Tripura. The situation in Andhra
Pradesh and Bihar between 1988 and 1997 has been much worse. In recent
times, the newly created states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have been the
worst affected. Among the major deadliest attacks by Naxalites in the last
eight years include (indiatimes. com May 27, 2013):
February 9, 2006. Eight CISF personnel killed when Naxalite rebels
raided an NMDC warehouse and took away explosives from a village
near Bailadilla 1n Jagdalpur 1n Chhattisgarh.
September7, 2007. Former AP Chief Minster N. Janardhan Reddy and
his wife escaped unhurt while three Congress workers killed in an
attack in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh.
March 5,2007. JMM’s Lok Sabha member Sunil Kumar Mahato shot
dead by Maoists. Two of his bodyguards and party colleagues also
killed while watching a football match at a village 1n Jamshedpur in
Jharkhand.
fuly 1, 2008: Maoist rebels carried out attacks on a police station,
killing nine people, including policemen, at an outpost in Sasaram in
Bihar’ s Rohtas district and flee with arms and ammunition.
October 8, 2009. Seventeen policemen were killed in an ambush by
Maoists at the Laheri police station in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra

17 October 2013: In another daring attack, suspected Maoists
Idetonated a cane bomb to blow up a vehicle killing all its seven
occupants near Pathara village in Aurangabad.
In all these attacks mostly policemen and politicians were killed.
The exploited poor and the tribals continue to follow Naxalite terrorism
for protecting themselves from ex—zamindars, moneylenders, and othe1
exploiters. The government deals with the Naxalite terrorism purely as a
problem of law and order whereas, as Althea Carbon of University of
Canterbury, New Zealand, writes in his essay posted on
indiafutureofchange.com that, in view of the multidimensional aspect of the
problem, a three-pronged approach should be adopted: a balance between
military forces, social and economic development and dialogue between parties.

<h1>
Terrorism in Kashmir
</h1>
<p>
India has been faced with this problem from the early 1990s and has also
fought two wars with Pakistan on this issue, but the governments have not
been able to take hard decisions and evolve a definite coherent policy. Our
policy makers have been chasing the mirage of soft options and have been
following a weak- kneed approach in dealing with the terrorists. Terrorism in
Kashmir assumed a new shape 1988 onwards. The militants launched a bloody
battle  to underline their separate identity. The neighbouring countries, partic-
ularly Pakistan, determined to see turmoil continuing in the valley, are
providing training and weapons to the militants even today. The people have
also been so brain-washed that they talk of the excesses of the police and the
para-military forces. For the militants, the criticism of the government by the
people means that people are more than willing to support them. On the
other hand, the Hindus have been forced by the militants to leave Kashmir. It
is claimed in one report that nearly two lakh Hindus ﬂed Kashmir valley

<p>
between 1988 and 1991. The Hindus claimed that the fundamentalists and
militants had infiltrated every sphere of the government in the valley till the
middle of 1996 and that what ruled the roost was not the writ of the
government but that of the militants. They maintained that the pro-Pakistan
forces had overtaken the valley and 1n a way, there was a collapse of the
administration and the terrorists wanted them to quit the valley. The civilian
Muslims now claim that they are innocent and are being unnecessarily
harassed. The militants had resorted to extortion and kidnapping for
monetary gains and political motives. In October-November 1993, 40-Odd
militants (including three foreigners) were holed up inside Hazratbal shrine
for 31 days. They had kept 20 civilians too as their hostages. In July 1995, the
militant group of Al-Faran kidnapped five foreigners and kept them captives,
demanding the release of some hard-core militants. After beheading a
Norwegian national hostage after a few weeks, the Al-Faran have held the
remaining four tourists captive for about two years keeping the governments
guessing as to whether the hostages are still alive or not. There is no dearth of
weapons in the valley, nor is there any dearth of frustrated youths to operate
them. Hizb—ul-Mujahedeen was claimed to have a cadre strength of 20,000
with at least 10,000 persons being trained in camps across the border and in
the valley. The Jammu 8L Kashmir Liberation Front (IKLF) still clings on to
the concept of an independent state (Azad Kashmir) as opposed to a merger
with Pakistan, whereas other militant groups like Lashkar—e—Toiba and
Jaish-e—Mohammad favour a Pakistani Kashmir. All militants at one time had
developed a feeling that they had to unite against a common enemy-the
Indian Armed Forces.
</p>
<p>
	Some sources claim that till two years ago, Muslims from other
countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, Libya, Bangladesh, Lebnon
Saudi Arabia and Turkey were engaged 1n terrorist activities in Kashmir (India
Today, May is, 1994. 45-66). Pakistan’s aiding and abetting terrorism in
Kashmir is said to be the deliberate policy of the government. It considers
liberation of Kashmir important in three respects: firstly, tension over
Kashmir creates a diversion from frustrations at home; secondly, the Kashmir
cause allows Pakistan to rally the support of its Islamic parties and their
loyalists in the military and the IsI; and thirdly, Kashmir could also serve the
regime as an important access point to the markets of Central Asia. No
wonder, Pakistan always remains interested in an escalation of the jihad for
the liberation of Kashmir.

	   However, there was also a time, particularly after 2004, when the valley
remained largely peaceful. The number of terrorist activities suddenly came to
a standstill and with the flourishing of the tourism in the valley people started

visiting it very' often without any fear. But, with intense fighting ensued
between the infiltrators and the Indian army in the Kargil area of the western
part of the state in 1999 and violent attacks on the Kashmir Assembly and the
Indian Parliament in New Delhi in 2001, there was again a war-like situation
between the two countries.
</p>
<p>
	In a report published in Times of India (24 August 2013), it was revealed
that over the last ten years, overall killings have shown an upward graph for
the ﬁrst time since 2004, indicating the reversal of violence in Jammu 8C
Kashmir While fatal casualties among security forces have seen a sharp
five-fold 1ncrease till August 18, 2013, over the corresponding period of last
year, civilian casualties have also jumped by 25 per cent this year.
</p>
<p>
	Even the figure of terrorists killed was higher at 38 until August 18, as
against 36 in the same period of last year.
    According to the latest statistics of J8CK violence compiled by the Union
home Ministry, 36 security personnel have lost their lives in
militancy/terror-related incidents so far this year, registering a 414 per cent
increase over the seven killings recorded in the corresponding period of last
year and 15 in 2012.
</p>
<p>
	The rise in violence indices in JBLK may warrant a rethink in strategy.
Besides the military strategy, political, economic, and cultural strategies too
have to be used in combating Kashmir uprisings. The bridges of trust have to
be built by far-sighted political initiatives.

<h1>
ULFA Terrorism
</h1>
<p>
Terrorism in Assam emerged from 1980 onwards. Assamese already had
raised the issue of removing ‘foreigners’ and deleting their names from the
electoral rolls. When the government failed to take action, there were agita-
tions in February 1983 elections in which 5,000 persons lost their lives. After
The AASU movement when the Assam Gana Parishad (AGP) came to power
in 1986, it was felt that the State would develop. But the factions soon led to
the Split of the AGP. The United Minorities Front (UMP) and the United
Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) emerged as two militant organizations.
The All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) also demanded a separate state
resulting in considerable violence. The ULFA stepped up its campaign of
murder, loot and kidnapping. The terrorist activities spread panic not only
among the non-Assamese but also amongst the Assamese people. The army
action-named Operation Bajrang—against the secessionist militant organi-
zation subdued it to the extent that the militant activities did not interfere
even with the elections in June 1991. It was hoped that the formation of the
new Congress government in June 1991 would rout or weaken organizations

<p>
like the ULFA Bodo Security Force, and the ASDC and that the new
government would be able to contain the terrorist activities of the militant
organizations in the state. But the abduction of persons from different parts of
the state and the killing and the looting of the people belied these expecta-
tions. The eight-year Bodoland movement was formally ended in 1994 when
the Bodo Peoples’ Action Committee (BPAC) and the All Bodo Students
Union (ABSU) agreed to accept a Bodoland Autonomous Council within the
state of Assam. This Council (of 40 members) was to have full autonomy to
make the development plans relating to 38 specified subjects and jurisdiction
over roughly 15,000 sq km spread over seven districts of Assam. However, the
continuing of Bodo agitations in 1995, 1996 and even in 1997 indicate that the
agreement between the government and the Bodos has not borne the expected
fruit. Even the new AGP government that came in power in 1996 and
successive governments have failed to contain the ethnic violence and almost
daily we read about the acts of violence in the state in newspapers.
</p>
<p>
	Besides the above-mentioned political aspect of terrorism (in Punjab,
Kashmir, Assam, etc.) in India, it has one more aspect too, what may be
called the ‘Islamic aspect’. India is the only major power that is the
odd-man-out amidst the ‘Islamic Crescent’ that stretches from Saudi
to Indonesia. A product of the 1970 and the late Pakistan’s Prime Minister
Z.A. Bhutto’s talk of ‘Islami Bomb’, this phenomenon resurged with the
Iranian Revolution. The emergence of fundamentalist forces in the Arab
world posed the principal threat to governments in many countries like
Egypt and Algeria. The Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union and
of the communist ideology in Eastern Europe have been the recent
landmarks. If these developments ended the financial support, weapons and
safehavens to anti-west groups (like the Palestinians), they also market the
emergence of ‘de-ideologized’ Central Asian republics. For the South Asian
region, the coming of Central Asian nations under the religio-cultural
influence of Turkey and Iran and Saudi-backed attempts by Pakistan to
reach them militarily, are new developments. The support of Islamic
countries to Kashmiri terrorists is based on this ideology.
</p>
<p>
	Besides Punjab, Kashmir and the North- East, the activities of the
terrorists are sometimes heard from other parts of the country also. For
example, in March 1993, the terrorists killed 235 and injured 1,200 persons
through serial bomb blasts in Mumbai (Bombay). In a similar attack in
Calcutta (Kolkata) in March 1993, 86 persons were killed. In November 2008,
Mumbai again witnessed Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack in which 164
persons were killed and at least 308 wounded. Earlier, on 13 May 2008, in
serial bombings, 63 persons will killed more than 216 injured in Jaipur.

TADA
</h1>
<p>
The Government of India enacted an Act in 1985 called the Terrorists and
Disruptive Activities Prevention Act (T ADA) to deal with terrorists and
Terrorism. Besides providing for conviction of the terrorists, the Act provided
for designated courts which curtailed the usual rights of the accused persons.
      Our government has in fact gone a long way since February 1950 when
the parliament was moved to adopt the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. This
Act gave way to the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) in 1971 and
to the National Security Act (NSA) in 1980. TADA, passed in 1985, was the
deformed child of these ugly laws. It is said that the then Home Minister
sardar Patel had passed two sleepless nights before introducing the Preventive
Detention Bill in 1950. One judge had described this Act in 1969 as
"repugnant to democratic constitution”, while another had characterized the
legislation as “a negation of the rule of law, equality, and liberty”. In 1979, one
court described the detention of individuals without trial as wholly incon-
sistent with the basic ideas of our Constitution. But, the enactment of TADA
was accepted by the judiciary without much critical resistance. TADA
prohibited bail and shifted the burden of proof onto the accused persons. It
was in fact devised as to leave every citizen’s liberty at the mercy of the men in
power (police and magistrates) for a period of at least one year and possibly
much more. TADA was thus not a penal law for prosecuting or bringing
terrorists .to trial. It allowed detention in judicial custody and avowed investi-
gation for up to one year without any formal charge at all. Once in detention,
the accused was vulnerable to pressures; even his confession to a police officer
was admissible as evidence. All proceedings were conducted in camera.
</p>
<p>
	Since its enactment in May 1985, TADA had gone through various
phases. It was amended in 1989, 1991 and 1993. The number of states invoking
TADA also increased from 1985 onwards. While in 1985, only four states and
two union territories had invoked its provisions, in 1991 the number of states
increased to 17 and in 1992 it was 20. In May 1995, when TADA expired and a
new Bill was introduced in the parliament to replace it, TADA was in force in
22 out of 25 states and two out of seven union territories. But surprisingly,
very few terrorists were convicted for treason under TADA up to May 1995.
the only convictions were for illegal possession of arms and ammunition. No
wonder, it was claimed that TADA had not achieved anything in the fight
against terrorism. The most glaring example of terrorists circumventing
TADA was Operation Black Thunder in Assam in which all the 46 accused
persons were discharged on a technicality.
       The total number of persons arrested in the country under TADA from
1985 to August 1994 was 67,509 and up to January 1995 was 70,411. Of the

<p>The main criticisms against the act were: (1) It was widely misused
against the minority community by the state governments. (2) It was misused
by the police to harass people. (3) since not even 1 per cent of the cases had
ended in conviction, it was better to do away with a lawless law. (4)It violated
the general principles of criminal law that a confession before a police officer
was admissible in evidence and release of the accused on bail is extremely
difficult. (5) It provided a long jail term of no less than five years even for small
offences like possession of certain types of weapons.
</p>
<p>
	" People who wanted to retain TADA and were not in favour of enacting
an alternative Act gave their own arguments for it: (1) They did not agree that
TADA was being used only against the minority communities. When TADA
was implemented in Punjab, nobody had raised any objections but when it
was extended to Kashmir, Assam and other north-eastern states to contain
Terrorist and insurgency movements, then erupted the ‘hue and cry’ for its
withdrawal mainly by the minority community. Giving facts and figures,
they held that of about 70,000 people arrested under TADA, only 4. 62 per
cent belonged to the minority community. (2) Terrorism and smuggling
could not be dealt effectively with the new proposed legislation. (3) If TADA
was misused, what was the guarantee that the new Act would not be misused.
what was needed was elimination of lacunae 1n TADA and not its repeal.
if number of persons arrested under TADA was high only in four or five ,
states which really had faced a serious problem of terrorism, bomb blasts,
killings and kidnappings etc. in as many as nine states, the number of persons
arrested, was even less than 100. (6) When the Central Government wanted
the views of the state governments on modifying the Act or scrapping it,
17 out of 22 states had informed the Centre that the Act be extended.
</p>
<p>
      Counselled by these divergent views, the Government of India allowed
the TADA to expire on May 23,1995 and did not try to extend 1ts life. A new
bill called the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bi“, was introduced 1n Rajya
sabha on May 18,1995 1n place of TADA which sought to delete at least four
provisions of TADA which were considered obnoxious and which were
allegedly misused by the police. It also incorporated a number of safeguards.
However, this bill was suddenly withdrawn by the government in June 1995
with the promise that 1t would introduce a fresh bill after consulting various
Political parties. This new bi“ was introduced in parliament 1n 2002 and called
the prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002.

lation, was enacted against the backdrop of several terrorist attacks, especially

the attack on the parliament. The Act replaced the Prevention of Terrorism
Ordinance (POTO), 2001 and the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
(Prevention) Act (TADA) 1985, and was supported by the governing
National Democratic Alliance (NDA). It was, however, repealed in 2004 by
the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition.
</p>
<p>
	The Act defined what a ‘terrorist act’ and a ‘terrorist’ is, and granted
special powers to the investigating authorities described under the Act. To
ensure certain powers were not misused and human rights Violations Would
not take place, specific safeguards were built into the Act.
</p>
<p>
	Analogous to the provisions contained in TADA, the law provided that
a suspect could be detained for up to 180 days without the filing of chargesheet
in court. It also allowed law enforcement agencies to withhold the identities of
witnesses, and to treat a confession made to the police as an admission of guilt.
Under the Indian law, a person can deny such confessions in court, but not
under POTA. However, the law did, however, had some safeguards. A bail
ruling or verdict from a Special Court constituted under this Act Could be
appealed to a bench of two judges of the High Court of the same jurisdiction
Also, unlike TADA, it had no provision to allow preventive detention
</p>
<p>
	The provisions in the Act mentioned the possibility of both state and
central review committees, but offered few details as to their formation or use
As the Act began to be widely misused by the state governments, the central
government finally established a review committee to hear individual cases
related to this Act. At first, the committee functioned 1n a purely advisory
capacity.
</p>
<p>
In December 2003, by an overwhelming majority, India’s parliament
amended the Act with an ordinance designed to expand the scope of judicial
review. The new ordinance gave review commissions the authority to review
the prima facie case of an ‘aggrieved person’ and issue orders binding on the
state government and police. Though the amendment was an improvement
on the purely advisory capacity of the initial review committee because it
enhanced the power of judicial review, the central review commitee
remained largely impotent, as it could not initiate an investigation absent an
initial complaint and lacked clearly delineated investigatory powers.
Moreover, the review committee’s resources were limited, and it operated
under no regulated time-frame. Without sufficient autonomy, resources, or
guidelines, the committee was an illusory safeguard.
</p>
<p>
	Given the review committee’s limitations, only the grievances of those
persons with political connections to the central government were likely to be
heard. Further, even with political pressure from the central government and
a favourable advisory opinion by the review committee, the Tamil Nadu

Government detained Vaiko of MDMK for over four months without charge,
and an additional fourteen months after charging him before granting bail.
     Once the Act became law, many reports surfaced of the law being
grossly abused. POTA was arbitrarily used to crack down political
opponents. Only four months after its enactment, state law enforcement
officers had arrested 250 people nationwide under the Act, and the number
was steadily increasing. A mere eight months later, seven states applying
POTA had arrested over 940 people, at least 560 of whom were languishing in
jail. Several prominent persons like Vaiko were arrested under the Act.
      On October 7, 2004, the Union Cabinet under UPA government,
repealed the Act by passing Prevention of Terrorism (Repeal) Act, 2004.
     Now, a question arises. all things considered, does the country require
(y ordinary laws? The considered opinion is that 1t does. The special laws
are like life-saving drugs to be administered only when every other medicine
fails. The makers of our Constitution had no doubt wisely included the
Emergency provisions in it but they never expected that the time would arise
when our country would face varieties of terrorism-political, communal,
ideological, theological, ethnic, etc. and special laws would be needed to face
them. Time had proved them to be grossly over-optimistic. The violence used
by the terrorists, the demand for the secession of the states, and the increasing
role of the neighbouring countries in supplying money, weapons and training
to terrorists in India make it necessary that special laws be enacted to deal with
these situations. Let there be a purposeful debate on the need for extraor-
dinary laws which will have the support of the majority of the nation.

<h1>
Terrorism in Other Countries
</h1>
<p>
	Terrorism is a global phenomenon today. Over the years, it has made its
presence felt in almost every corner of the globe. For example, with the
emergence of terrorist organizations like Al Qaida, most of the countries in
the world are, in a way or the other, facing the threat of terrorism. Apart from
this, local terrorist organizations. such as Irish Republic Army (ERA) in
Ireland and LTTE in Sri Lanka, are also working.
       The legitimacy of the kind of terrorism used by these terrorist groups
can be gauged by several socio-economic and political factors as well as by the
fact of Whether it was considered as the last resort in their political struggle
after unsuccessfully trying all other means of struggle. On the other hand,
terrorism loses its legitimacy if it can be proved that the available legitimate
means have been bypassed before resorting to the use of terrorism.
       0f late, international terrorism has also gained currency. The support to
terrorists of one country can come from individuals and groups sympathetic

<p>
to their cause, or it can come from other state governments, like support given
by Pakistan to militants in Kashmir, or by some Arab states to the Palestinian
groups, or support of former Libyan President Gaddafi to the IRA in Ireland
or the Moros in Philippines.
       The examples of state terror are found in Russia, China and Cambodia
The three famous examples of Russian terrors are the Tsarist reign of terror in
1905—07, the Bolshevik terror rule in 1917—18 and the Stalin period of terror
in 1934—35. In China, people faced the white terror of Chiang Kai shikh in
1923, Mao’s terror in 1950-53 in which 10 to 20 million people were killed,
and terror during the Cultural Revolution in 1966—69 in which student power
and People’s Liberation Army were used to revive Mao’s personal authority
The state terror in Kampuchea (formerly known as Cambodia) occurred in
1975 in which two million people out of a total population of eight million
were massacred. The examples of state terror were also found 1n East Pakistan
in 1971, in Iran 1n 1983— 85 and 1n Nazi Germany 1n 1933—34.
</p>
<p>
	The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December ' ’_.
condemning all methods and practices of terrorism wherever . .1
whomever committed. It called upon all states to refrain from org '-
instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in other states or .v
escing in activities within their territories directed towards the commissiv
such acts. It also urged all states to cooperate with one another t .

<h1>
Causes of Terrorism: Theoretical Explanations
</h1>
<p>
Following Gurr (1970: 47), the causes of terrorism may be explained on the
basis of the Theory of Relative Deprivation. According to this this theory
political collective violence may be described as a consequence of gap devel-
oping between the value expectations of a given group of people and the value
capabilities of the group. Gurr has talked of three types of deprivations:
1. Declivity deprivation occurs when the value capabilities of a given
population decline drastically but the value expectations remain the
same. Bolsheviks’ collective political violence in Russia in 1917 was due
to this type of deprivation. The Russian people, after World War I were
a discontented lot, and the failure of the government to terminate the
Russian involvement 1n the war led to a swing in popular sentiment in
one group (Lenin and his party) that promised immediate peace.
2. Aspirational depﬁwtion occurs when the value capabilities of the given
population remain the same but value expectations increase. Terrorism
in the Kashmir valley is due to this type of deprivation. Similarly, the
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000507">507</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
	ULFA terrorism in Assam is the result of the demands for immediate
   equality as opposed to the continuing discrimination and prejudice
   against them.
   Progressive deprivation occurs when value expectations increase and the
   value capabilities decline. The Khalistan-oriented terrorism is the best
   example of this.
   The process of modernization and the ‘ethnicity explosion’ lead to
widespread feelings of relative deprivation.
</p>
<h1>
The Terrorists
</h1>
<p>
All this discussion brings us to the basic question of the terrorist personality.
What are the conditions and factors which create such a personality? How does
such a personality evolve and reach a point of no return? How does it emerge as
a pure machine of destruction, insensitive to the objective reality around, and
unresponsive donsive to pity and compassion? How may such a personality be
recovered and restored to moral health? Some scholars may argue that these are
the questions of technology which fall within the scope of the science of
psychology and not sociology. But others may view them as problems of social
psychology. The truth 18 that no one is born as a terrorist. We have, therefore,
to reject totally the role of heredity genes, blood, etc. in terrorist’ s personality.
Equally, no theory of a bruised childhood or of an evil neighbourhood and
environment is going to explain a terrorist’s behaviour. For each abused youth
who turns into a terrorist, there are scores of youths who nurse no such injuries
and traumas and in fact become a part of the social order. Recent studies have
shown that over 80 per cent of the terrorists in advanced countries come from
reasonably afﬂuent families (D.S. Maini, Wye Hindustan Times, April 9, 1995).
Each terrorist personality is thus an individual case, though it may end up as
having almost all the marks of its tribe.
</p>
<p>
	    Psychologists have advanced theories to explain the working of the
terrorist mind and the making of the terrorist personality. For example,
Lawrence Zelic Freedman writing on “PerspectiVes on Terrorism” has offered
four hypotheses in this regard (see D.S. Maini, ibid.:) (a) the aﬂirmation of
self-esteem, where an ego has been deeply hurt and denied identity; (b) deper—
sonalization, i.e., the surrender of one ’s personality 1n the service of a group;
(c) a method of establishing intimacy, i.e., becoming a terrorist as a means to
enforce recognition and thus establish a subjective relationship with one ’s
victim; and (d) a belief in ‘tbe magic of violence’, where in the elements of
secrecy, mystery and wonder fuse to propel the terrorist toward an unknown
territory. To this list, Maini adds other factors like: (i) a big business
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000508">508</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:508
</h1>
<p>
	linking-up with the underworld and the local magic, (ii) a form of revenge to
redress insult, (iii) as an aspect of messianic (confusing) politics, (iv) as an intol
erable urge for action, (v) as a surrogate sexual activity, and (vi) as a group
narcissirn (mental state in which there is self-worship). All this indicates that
the phenomenon of terrorism is a complex tissue of inflamed sentiment,
thought and passion, and of action and abstraction.
</p>
<p>
	     There is thus bound to be a certain arbitrariness in classifying thé
of terrorists. For instance, while the American professor of Psychiatry
Frederick]. Hacker has given three types of terrorists: the crazy, the criminal,
and the crusading, the Russian scholar Viktor Vitiuk (Leftist Terrorism, 1985)
has classified them as the ‘idealists’, the ‘filibusters’, and the ‘lost souls’. while
the chances are that a person may become a terrorist in a slow process, there is
a possibility of suddenly becoming a terrorist due to an impulsive and a
passionate response to a given situation-a personal injury, a communal
trauma, a political tragedy, etc. In the terrorists of Punjab, for example, all
these factors in varying degrees had their validity. What ultimately sustains a
terrorist in the face of various contradictions and compulsions is a cause, an
idea, or a dream. Ultimately, 1t is a leader, a chrismatic figure, who will bind
him to the group to keep him going, since his own authority is lllusory and
deceptive and his power of manipulating reality is a receding vista. His dreams
require a feedback and he gets this nourishment from his image. He then
continues to be a terrorist even when the leader is gone from the scene, killed
or executed.
</p>
<p>
	What are then the chances of a terrorist’s return to the path of sanity and
normalcy? While developing a terrorist’s philosophy, since he remained
willing even to give his life for the cause he was fighting, he remains a terrorist
throughout his life. Yet, the rigours of life and the corrective processes may
contribute to his recovery. A mother’s love, a secular politician’s appeal, a
woman’s attraction may hasten the process. But then there always remains  the
possibility of his bouncing back into the life of terrorism.
</p>
<h1>
Combating Terrorism: Models
</h1>
<p>
Terrorism is too serious a problem to be left to politicians alone. General
awareness among the masses and pressures on people are the only way out
The one thing we have to understand is that terrorism is like a common cold.
It runs its own course and there is need for patience.
      Basically, there are three models of combating terrorism. the Indian, the
American and the Israeli. A comparison of these three models 15 necessary for
furthering our understanding.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000509">509</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:509
</h1>
<h1>
The Israeli Model
</h1>
<p>
terrorism in Israel has been prevailing for the last four decades. Initially, for
about one and a half decades (1953 to 1967), the Palestinians living in the west
of Jordan and in the Gaza strip carried out their resistance through cross
border raids by sneaking into Israel. The Israelis responded by carrying out
airborne raids and by intruding into Jordan and destroying Palestinian camps
with tanks. Since these attacks caused extensive damage to Jordanian army
and property, the public opinion in Jordan turned against supporting the
PLO. Along with Jordan, other Arab countries also prevented the PLO from
carrying out its activities from their soil. Jordan launched a purge in
September 1970 against the Palestinians and killed about 15,000 of them. The
PLO base in Lebanon also was eliminated when Israel invaded Lebanon in
1982. Israel, thus, dealt with the PLO terrorists by eliminating their bases.
The Palestinians then adopted the tactics of hijacking Israeli civilian aircrafts
and also kidnapping the Israeli civilians and demanding the release of their
jailed colleagues in Israel. The Israeli government never yielded to such
terrorist threats and 1n retaliation attacked the Palestinian camps. Though the
Israeli policy of non-negotiation with the terrorists was often criticized but
Israel never budged from its position, maintaining that once they gave into
hijackings and kidnappings, they would multiply manifold. Thus, the four
primary components of the Israeli strategy in dealing with terrorist violence
are: (1) refusal to negotiate with terrorists, (2) retaliatory raids on the bases of
terrorists, (3) strict security measures, and (4) covert violence against Pales-
tinians (even innocent) connected with terrorists and sympathizers of
palestinians. Thus, the Israeli model of combating terrorism is based on ‘coun-
ter-terror’ and ‘anti-terror’ rather than passive defensive measures.
</p>
<h1>
The American Model
</h1>
<p>
The United States has global economic interests and is vulnerable to terrorism.
The most potent weapon of America to fight terrorism has been its economic
clout like cutting off trade and technology export. When this fails, the US
bombs the enemy country supporting terrorists. This method was adopted for
cuba in 1962 and for Libya 1n 1986 when 1ts leader Colonel Gaddafi supported
terrorist movements like those of the PLO or of the IRA of Northern Ireland
or of the HUK rebels of Philippines, or of the terrorist gangs in Latin America.
the same method was adopted by America when it invaded Cambodia for
giving, shelter to Vietcong during the Vietnam war. In Afghanistan too, the
same strategy was adopted by America when it supported Talibani rivals against
the Pro-Soviet government. Thus, the American model of combating terrorism
was 'counter-terror campaign’ and inVasion.

The Indian Model
</h1>
<p>
India has been facing severe problems of violence and terrorism since the
19605. The insurgency in the north-east in the 19603 and the 19705 was tackled by
the government more through political methods. The violence in Jammu &
Kashmir also falls more into the category of insurgency rather than pure
terrorism. ‘Operation Blue Star’ of the military on June 6,1984 in Punjab and
‘Operation Black Thunder’ in Assam designed to counter terrorism totally
failed. They were anti-terrorist measures (implemented mainly through the
police forces and partially through the military forces) rather Then
counter-terrorist measures. The hallmark of the policies in the former
measures are: frequent road checks, sentries at vulnerable points and elaborate
security for the VIPs. The countries which supply the bulk of arms, or give
shelter to terrorists or finance terrorism have not been called to account. Even
there, the emphasis is on passive measures like border fencing or lodging mild
protests. No wonder, even after 50 years, India has not been able to control
terrorism. The government in most cases succumbs to the demands of the
terrorists as happened in Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.
</p>
<p>
	Thus, the three models (Israeli, American and Indian) of combating
terrorism are different 1n content as well as in temperament. In a way, they
reﬂect the power of the states. The American model 18 ‘counter—terror’ model.
which is based on hitting at the very roots of terrorist support. The Indian
model is anti-terrorist model. The Israeli model 15 “blend of counter-terror
and anti-terrorist measures”. The terrorist menace cannot be eliminated either
through anti-terroror counter-terror approaches. Besides the police and the
military measures, the socio—political issues have also to be tackled. The bases
in the countries, at least the neighbouring countries, supporting the terrorists,
needs to be attacked and destroyed. The policy in dealing with such countries
has to be deterrent.
</p>
<p>
	The Government of India cannot face the problem of terrorism merely
by enlisting public sympathy or by blaming countries of giving support to
terrorists. Helping terrorists in a hostile country is a fact of life which no
organized government in modern times can ignore. India has to evolve its
own system of dealing with terrorists.
Some methods which may prove to be helpful to our government in this
regard are (Saxena, 1985: 33—34):
' seeking cooperation of the citizens by the police to get information
against the terrorists;
' reducing the finance at the disposal of the terrorists to contain their
operations;
' refusing to accept any demands of any group of terrorists;
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000511">511</pagenum>

<p>
giving swift and judicial punishments to arrested terrorists. The
greater the delay in prosecution and greater the detention in the jail as
undertrials, the greater the possibility of their (terrorists’) escape;
adopting more effective intelligence methods in retrieving infor-
mation about the terrorists, their associates, their modus operandi,
and their sources of finance and weapons, etc.;
improving security measures continuously at important places; and
giving more scientific training to forces dealing with terrorists.
</p>
<h1>
Sociology of Terrorism
</h1>
<p>
How does terrorism disrupt the political system or social organizations? How
does terrorism act as a method for hastening social change? How does
terrorism explain the social relationship between a frustrated minority and
the ruling political elite, or between a group which feels deprived and a group
which has the monopoly on the use of force? A holistic sociological
perspective of terrorism will be possible only when We discuss large—scale
political events not only in aggregate numerical terms but also in impact
terms, that is, we focus not only on quantitative macropolitics but also on
qualitative micropolitics.
</p>
<p>
    Terrorism demoralizes and demobilizes populations and disintegrates
societies, though it is also true that terrorism in some instances serves as an
integrative mechanism binding people together in a common cause.
Terrorism may involve the problem of law and order, that is, of killing or
kidnapping of one group by other group because of its religious affiliations or
sub-cultural differences, but it does not disrupt the social systems. Nor is
terrorism a special method for hastening historical change. No terrorist
movement has ever succeeded in achieving its goals. Terrorists, therefore, do
not shape the course of historical events.
</p>
<p>
	For understanding terrorism, it is necessary to measure the amount of
violence engaged 1n by the terrorists to effect their desired ends, the quantum
of force utilized by the police and the armed forces to prevent social change,
and also  to measure the types of violence. Using this perspective to terrorism
in India, the number of people killed and kidnapped in Bihar in one year is
much more than the killings and kidnappings in Punjab or Kashmir. When a
terrorist takes a life in the name of social justice, he faces a problem of social
accounting at one level and moral constraint at another. One might also speak
of the results of the use of terror to overthrow state authority. Suppose we
accept the temporary disruption of the normal administrative activities of
politico-social systems, do we not face the same results whenever we are faced
with any social or natural calamity? Does the killing of one or two, or even a
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000512">512</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:512
</h1>
<p>
few important political leaders by the terrorists change the structure of
politics? By and large, the nature of political process in the society is not inter
fered with, nor it is interrupted by these killings. Quantitatively, thus, the
killings by terrorists may not be significant but they do involve the qualitative
traumas. This 15 the problem we faced 1n the assassinations of Indira Gandhi
and Rajiv Gandhi by the terrorists. As a result, we may not label terrorist
activities ‘ﬂunsuccessful but at the same time, we cannot view them as
”successful too in terms of the limited numbers involved. Sociologically,
therefore, terrorists may not be able to topple the social order but do
loosen that order symbolically by weakening the legitimating capacities of
administrative officials and the power elite. To board an aeroplane, one might
agree to get his luggage checked or go through the security measures for
approaching an important person; nevertheless, one has a perfect right to raise
questions about these new social costs. These symbolic changes as the result of
consequences of terrorism may be irritable but their transitory nature is
invariably important for social evaluation. The social impact of terrorism
which may totally affect the society on a long-term basis, thus, should be the
central focus in any system of analytic measurement. It may, therefore, be
concluded that claiming that terrorism disintegrates society or affects the
survival of the system will not be very correct.
Nevertheless, mechanisms have to be created to prevent acts of terror,
Terrorism and political violence have become the bane of Indian 5ociety
today. Both are leading the country towards anarchy and chaos. Terrorists kill
in the name of religion and region, in the name of language and culture. It is
time that the prevalent frustration and a sense of deprivation amongst people
particularly the youth, be checked. On one hand, the government has to deal
with the terrorists with a very firm hand, and on the other the minorities have
to be protected and right atmosphere created for the functioning of a genuine
democracy. The terrorism of the terrorists of terrorizing the terrorized has to
be contained.
</p>
<h1>
Fundamentalism
</h1>
<p>
Some people use ‘fundamentalism’ synonymous with terrorism because it is
an ideology of extremists, a feeling of self— righteousness, and moral
correctness of one’s cause and one’s objective. It convinces the believer that
others and their causes are wrong, and they should be corrected, even by
resorting to coercion, and they should be defeated or converted, and if need
be, even eradicated (Ehsan Ahrari, Asia Times.com, October 9, 2004, cited in
Sheth, 2005: 38). The Online Free Dictionary has defined fundamentalism as
“a usually religious movement or point of view characterized by a return to

<p>
fundamental principles, by rigid adherence to those principles, and often by
intolerance of other views and opposition to secularism”.
     Although, all the religions, more or less, have patches of fundamentalist
psurge, but no religion is so closely knit with politics as is Islam. That is why
the most talked about example of fundamentalism cited these days is of
islamic fundamentalism though there are also Christian fundamentalism,
Hindu fundamentalism, etc.
       Religious fundamentalism has risen to worldwide prominence since the
1970s. It has taken place from a large variety and interaction of factors and
forces such as political, social, economic, etc.

Corruption
</h1>
<p>
Corruption is a complex social problem that affects all societies. India is no
exception. It is no longer considered a soﬁ state as political scientists once used
to call it. It has now become a kleptocracy, a consideration state, where every
thing to be had can be had for a consideration. Here, it is said, obvious does
not happen. For example, if a person wants a government job, he/ she had to
pay lakhs of rupees to the higher officials irrespective of satisfying the eligi-
bility criteria. In every government office one has either to give money to the
employee concerned or arrange for some sources to get work done. There is
adulteration and duplicate weighing of products 1n food and civil supplies
department by unscrupulous workers who cheat the consumers by playing
with the health and lives of innocent people. In the assessment of property tax
one has to pay bribes even if the house 13 built as per rules and regulations.
    Political corruption is also worst in India. A newly elected independent
MLA lS yffered crores of rupees as well as a ministership for supporting the
ruling party. Today, corruption has taken the shape of such as common menace
that people do not mind giving bribe even for getting a lawful work done.
</p>
<h1>
Concept
</h1>
<p>
Corruption 13 broadly defined by the World Bank to mean the use of public
office for private gain. In simple terms, it may be described as “an act of
bribery”. It has also been described as “the use of public power for private
profits in a way that constitutes a breach of law or a deviation from the norms
of society”. D.H. Bailey has explained it as “misuse of authority as a result of
consideration of personal gain which need not be monetary” (cited in Douglas
</p>

Johnson, 1971). Andriski considers it as “the use of public power for
;te advantage in ways which transgress some formal rule or law” (cited in
ael, 1983). Szeftel has observed that “corruption is behaviour which is
i, ce from norms and duties governing the exercise of public role or office
rivate gains” (cited in Machael, 1983). This private gain is achieved by
ring prohibitions against certain acts, by exercising legitimate
.a etion to act, or by fulfilling obligations to act. J. Nye (1967: 410) states
“corruption denotes the abuse or misuse of public offices for personal
”. Corruption is also described as “deviation from formal duties of public
for pecuniary or status gains”.
   Thus, in its broadest sense, corruption is the lack of integrity—whether
intellectual, moral or financial. And, when integrity fails, the entire society
collapses.
, Corruption is spread over in the society in several forms. Of these, the
1r ones are: bribe (money offered in cash or kind or gift as inducement to
i' e illegal or dishonest action in favour of the giver), nepotism (undue
’ ., from holder of patronage to relatives), misappropriation (using other’s
for one’s own use), patronage (wrong support/ encouragement given
7,; on and thus misusing the position), and favouritism (unduly preferring
other).

<h1>
Corruption: A Historical Perspective
</h1>
<p>
corruption is a global phenomenon. It is found almost in every society in one
or the other form since time immemorial. In ancient times, the judges received
bribes in Egyptian, Babilonian and Hebrew societies. In Rome, bribe was a
common feature in elections to public offices. In France, judicial offices were
sold during the fifteenth century. England was described a ‘sink—hole’ of
corruption in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. In the nineteenth
century also, corruption was so rampant in Britain that Gibbon described it as
the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty (Seminar, No. 421,
September 1994).
   In India too, corruption has prevailed from time immemorial in one
form or the other. Kautilya has referred in his Art/9mm: (Samasastry, 1967:
15-17) to embezzlement by government servants out of the state revenue. He
has mentioned about forty types of embezzlement and corrupt practices
adopted by government servants. During Ashoka’s regime, corruption
prevailed on a lower scale (Majumdar, 1960: 113). In medieval society, scope
for corruption was minimum because only few authorities existed for the
collection of taxes. So long they amassed wealth, they were praised rather than
censured. During the British rule, bribes were accepted not only by the Indian

Hastings were found corrupt to an extent that they were tried by"{
mentary committee after their return to England. The expansi 1‘
economic activities during the first and second world wars opened n
of corruption in the country (Hallaya, 1948: 13—51). War-time to
restrictions and scarcities provided ample opportunities for .
corruption and favouritism. After independence, though top political,
the national level remained very honest for sometime but after the .a‘
the fourth general elections, the new political elite lost people’s conﬁ

started accepting huge bribes even for small considerations. Today, botli‘
central and the state levels, the number of politicians and bureaucrats

Corruption Among Public Servants

Corruption among public servants has always existed in one form or the o 1
although its shape, dimensions, textures and shades have. been changing from .'
to time and place to place. At one time, bribe was paid for getting wrong '
done but now the bribe is paid for getting right things done at the right time;

Which acts have been called ‘corrupt’ in public service? Though .."
term ‘corruption’ has wide connotations, the following patterns of behavi
among public servants can be described as ‘corrupt’ within the provisions":
law (Malhotra, 1992: 254—256): (1) acceptance of gratification as reward
work done in an official capacity, (ii) obtaining any object or pecuni‘
advantage illegally, (iii) fraudulent misappropriation of public property, (

being in possession of financial resources or property disproportionate to
one‘s known sources of income, (v) misuse or abuse of official position, (vi)
borroWing’ money for purchasing a costly article from a person with whom
one has  official dealings with a ‘known’ understanding that the ‘borrowed
money' will not be returned, (vii) accepting gifts by ‘persons of position’ from
persons with whom they have ‘positional’ relations, (viii) disregard of neglect
of rules purposely to help the citizen in avoiding dues/ tax/ duty due to be paid
to government, (ix) refusal to do a duty on some plea which may benefit the
other party (e.g., police officer not registering a case to protect a criminal).
</p>
<p>
	Extensive corruption in government departments/ ministries has almost
become a tradition. There are at least five ministries in the union government
which are regarded as gold mines for making money. These are: Defence,
Railways, Petroleum, Power, and Communication. The annual budget of
these ministries runs in billions. While commissions between 15 and 40 per
cent are not uncommon in defence purchases, the import of oil and natural
gas also yields a big kickback. Recently, we have also seen the examples of
Communication (2G spectrum) and Railways ministries where scandals
involving lakhs of crores of rupees ware broken out. In both the cases the
concerned ministers were found to be involved. While the 2G scam amounts
to about Rs 1,76,000 crore (according to CAG), in the railway scam the minis-
ter's nephew was alleged of accepting Rs 90 lakh from a Railway Board
member for promoting him as Member (Electricals). It is pertine  to
mention that the Member (Electricals) has huge financial powers being
responsible for around 35 per cent of total spending, amounting to about Rs
2,500 crore, of railways total budget.
</p>
<p>
	Four other departments where corruption is rampant are Public Works,
police, Excise, and Revenue. The Public Works Department gets a huge
portion of budget and plan provision for civil engineering works like
construction of buildings, maintenance of roads, digging drains, construction
of dams, and so on. Corruption in this department prevails from top to
bottom at all stages, like selection, purchase of materials, execution of work,
payment of bills, and settlement of disputes. It 18 said that out of the total cost
sanctioned for the project, about 70 per cent is invested 1n the work, 20 per
cent on contractor’s profit, and 10 per cent goes into various officers’ pockets.
</p>
<p>
	The Police Department is said to be the most corrupt department where
bribes are taken by constables upwards to high status officers. What is
surprising is that the police takes money both from the accused and the
complainants. The powers enjoyed by the police are so wide that they can
accuse, arrest, and harass even an honest person. Cases of beating the poor
people (e.g., rickshaw-pullers, labourers, shopkeepers, vendors, etc.) on small

<p>
pretexts and taking away all the money in their pockets, accepting money
from truck drivers, taking ‘hafta’ (weekly fixed amount) from shopkeepers
and the like are very common cases of corruption.
     The scope of corruption is greater where substantial decisions are taken
e.g., assessment and collections of taxes, sanctioning contracts, passing bills,
issuing cheques, approving supplies, and so forth. A predetermined percentage
is paid to the officials and this money is shared by all in the establishment. In
railways, for example, money is paid for the allotment of wagons, booking
parcels of perishables goods, passing damage claims, and so on. In many estab-
lishments, while awarding contracts, a fixed percentage is taken as a rule.
Similarly, failure to pay commission results in delay in getting the bills passed
and receiving the cheques. Often, dishonest contractors and suppliers wanting
to deliver inferior goods or getting approval of substantial work, spend a
portion of their ill-earned profits for getting their work done. Tax evasion,
sub-standard construction, supplying goods in small quantities, and charging
heavily for the repair of government vehicles, are other examples of corruption.
</p>
<p>
	Corruption is noticeable not only at the top but 1t also extends all the way
down. Assistant and junior engineers, middle and low rank Officials in
government departments like telephones, state electricity boards and water-
works, cops in police, inspectors in revenue and excise departments, Clerks in
secretariats, and junior staff in railways accept bribes 1n return for big and small
favours. In many establishments, junior officials have a fixed rate of kickbacks
as an unwritten rule. The amount may, however, vary from department to
department or as per nature of the contract/ transaction. For example, in the
Public Works Department (FWD, ignomiously called ‘Plunder without
Danger’), a junior engineer asks for 5 per cent of the total amount of the trans-
action, an assistant engineer for 3 per cent, while an executive engineer will have
to be content with a paltry 2 per cent. Similarly, in other departments, such as
income tax, police, etc., by and large, a similar situation exists, where 10 to 20
per cent is set aside as kickbacks—to be paid in cash or kind. In government
ofﬁces, even after the permission has been granted for something, the concerned
clerk will refuse to type the sanction letter or to post it unless he is paid bribe
amounting to 1 to 2 per cent of the transaction. At the lowest level, even the
peons take a tip of Rs 10 to Rs 50 to inform the officials of a visitor wishing to
see them. According to a recent study, jointly conducted by the Centre for
Media Studies and MRDA, across a dozen major transport hubs, including
Ludhiana, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Indore, Mumbai, Kolkata, Vijayawada
Bengaluru and Chennai, covering over 1,200 truck drivers, has revealed that
bribe worth Rs 22,000 crore is paid on roads in India every year and 90 percent
of this goes to policemen and transport department personnel (Times of India.

November 25, 2013). The corruption is so pervasive in the government depart-
that even a former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had to state in a public
getting that out of every Rs 100 sanctioned by the government for any public
programme, the people actually get the beneﬁt worth only Rs 20. No wonder
it the corruption has emerged as the most pernicious threat to governance in
There is perception of its encompassing all spheres of public life. The
sence of administration in the form of a public ofﬁcial—either police or
is today considered as synonymous to corruption, exploitation and
in India.
</p>
<p>
	Share of kickbacks in India keeps on shooting up every year that some
people started calling it humorously a ‘kickback nation’. In an article
published in Business Standard (13 July 2013), unravelling the sordid nexus
among businessmen, politicians and bureaucrats, Veena Sandhu and T.E.
rasimhan write: “The world of kickback is murky and difficult to unravel.
In such a scenario, the magnitude of the country’s kickback can only be
speculated, at best estimated, but is impossible to accurately calculate”.
     In India, after independence, both politicians and bureaucrats have made
normous amounts of money in the form of bribes. In 2012, of the 1,048 cases
which CBI registered, 790, i.e., more than 75 per cent, involved kickbacks
received by public servants. Similarly, the Central Vigilance Commission
VC) more than 37, 000 complaints of corruption during 2012 as compared to
407 complaints 1n 2011, which 13 113 per cent more than that of previous
(Sunday Times of Indza September 1, 2013). In 2011, the CVC received as
many as 8, 805 complaints of corruption against railway employees, followed by
30 against bank employees and 5,026 against income tax employees (Sandhu
Narasimhan, 2013).

Political Corruption and Scams
</h1>
<p>
as a Well-known fact that a large number of politicians not only in India but
most in all countries are corrupt. People never feel shocked when politicians’
corruption is divulged. Honest politicians are a rare breed today. Corrupt politi-
is not only go soot-free, unharmed and unpunished but they manage to strut
the political stage as honourable leaders. Examples of politicians like Lal
adur Shastri and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel are rare who had very little bank
once at the time of death. In this land of ours, while a thief who commits
for feeding his hungry children after remaining unemployed for a long
is promptly put behind the bars, those who plunder the country
querade as honourable citizens with all the paraphernalia merely because
happpen to be big-wigs in politics or are close to centres of power.

politics a rather profitable affair. An analysis by the Association of

Democratic Reforms (ADR)—a think-tank working on poll reforms-- for the
decade 2001—10 shows that average assets of 62,847 candidates who have
contested elections for parliament and state assemblies since 2004 were to the
tune of Rs 1.37 crore and those of victorious ones Rs 3.83 crore. What is more
interesting is that the wealth of legislators who faced criminal charges rose
even more to Rs 4.30 crore and those with serious criminal charges like
murder, kidnapping and rape were on the top of the heap with average assets
of Rs 4.38 crore (Times of India, July 30, 2013).
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, ADR,1n its press release Guly 10, 2013), revealed that a total of
1, 460 (or 30%) of the total 4, 807 sitting MPs and MLAs in the country have
criminal cases against them and of these 688 (or 14%) have serious criminal
cases. Out of the total Lok Sabha members (i.e., 543), 162 (or 30‘.) have
criminal cases against them which include 76 cases of serious crimes. The
corresponding figures for Rajya Sabha members (i.e., 232) are 40 and 16
respectively. And, in states, of the total 4,032 sitting MLAs, 1,258 (i.e., 31%)
have criminal against them, of which 596 (or 15%) are of serious nature.
</p>
<p>
	Recently, in its landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of India had
attempted to correct an anomaly in the Representation of People Act when it
held that there was no reason why elected representatives should be specially
protected from disqualification pending appeal when they are convicted for
offences specified in the Act. Sadly, instead of recognizing this and using it as
an opportunity to weed out criminal elements, the Government of India has
chosen to overturn the apex court’s judgment by issuing an ordinance. But,
facing rising public anger and bowing to Congress Vice President Rahul
Gandhi’s wishes the Union Cabinet later junked the contentious
ordinance/ bill protecting convicted MPs/MLAs from immediate disqualifi-
cation. Rashid Masood, ruling Congress leader became the first MP to be
disqualified due to his conviction in a corruption case.
</p>
<p>
	In the last two decades or so, several scandals and financial irregularities,
including paying of massive commissions, pay-offs and kickbacks, have been
reported in our country. Mostly, it is the Chief Ministers, ministers, leaders
holding important political positions, bureaucrats and big businessmen who are
reported to be involved in these scams. But nothing tangible has been done in
uncovering, tracing, apprehending, prosecuting and punishing the culprits on
the plea of ‘inadequate evidence’. We will point out here the most notorious
scandals/ scams that broke in India after independence (also see Table 1).
</p>
<p>
	Antulay Trust pay-oﬂscam (1981): AR Antulay, the then Chief Minister
of Maharashtra, allegedly garnered Rs 30 crore from businesses dependent on
state resources.
HDW scam (1987): The German submarine maker was blacklisted after
allegations that commissions worth Rs 420 crore had been paid in the 1987
deal in India.

Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi and several others who were accused of
receiving kickbacks from Bofors of Sweden for winning a bid to supply 155
mm field howitzer. The scale of the corruption was far worse than any that
India had seen before and directly led to the defeat of Gandhi’s ruling Indian
National Congress party in the November 1989 general elections. The
Swedish company paid INR640 million (US$12 million) in kickbacks to top
politicians.

during the distribution of foodgrain meant for the Sampooma Grameen
Rozgar Yojana. After initially ordering an inquiry into the scam, the chief
Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav withdrew it. The Special Investigation Team
(SIT), set up by the Mulayam Singh government in 2006, lodged over 5,000
FIRs. The latest of the scam series in India, initially referred as the 'UP rice
scam’ could be the biggest of them all, even outdistancing the 2G spectrum

	To realize the goal of maintaining a clean corporate sector, regulators are
extremely important. They must be fair and independent. According to Vittal
(abid: 195), corporate cleanliness can be maintained by the following:
legal requirements that make it mandatory to observe certain norms,
procedures, systems’
alert shareholders and media which can highlight malpractices; and
an independent judiciary that can intervene when things go beyond
control
   Let us hope that with our experience of over two decades of liberal-
ization and over four decades of permit-licence raj, the corporate sector and
the government will be able to work out pragmatic and clean models for the
future.
</p>
<p>
es of Corruption
</p>
<p>
Number of factors have been pointed out as causes of corruption or public
dishonesty. First is the emergence of political elite who believe in inter-
est-oriented rather than nation-oriented programmes and policies. In fact, the
post-British raj (rule) has been described as the “raj of ministers and bureau-
crats". The political elite in the first two decades after independence were
honest, dedicated and nation-oriented to the extent that they always worked for
the country’s progress. Later on, particularly after the fourth general elections
in 1967, such persons came to hold political power both at the Centre and in the
states who worked only on the basis of some vested interest, say, interest of self,
family, caste, region, party, and so forth. Their policies and programmes
incidentally might have been nation-oriented but essentially they were ‘inter-
est-based’. They encouraged the bureaucrats too to follow suit. A majority of
bureaucrats in our country are ‘ritualists’ and remain concerned more with
perks and privileges than with ‘development-oriented’ policies for the society.
the Politicians and bureaucrats thus started using their power and position for
illegal beneﬁts. The emergence of the new business leaders who wanted profits
even by sharing them with the people 1n power became equally responsible for
the mushroom growth of corrupt practices among the public servants.
corruption also emerges from the power of the government officials of taking
decisions, say, issuing licences, assessing income tax, giving extensions and so
on. is not the rules but the interpretation of the rules which enables officers to
receive kickbacks and pocket the bribe. Many officers pay thousands and lakhs
of rupees to get themselves posted in particular places only because those places
enable them to earn thousands and lakhs of rupees every month as illegal gratifi-
cation. The second cause is the economic policy of the government. Most of the
recent scandals have been in areas where either purchase policies or prices are

<p>
controlled by the government. Sugar, fertilizers, oil, military weapons,
electronic equipment, spectrum, etc., are some examples. One NRI
businessman some years ago claimed in the court that he had to pay
Chandraswami, with verbal assurance from a former Prime Minister, to get a
contract for selling pulp to India. Similar kickbacks were paid in Bofors,
telecom and many other scams. The real issue is freeing the economy from the
clutches of misguided government regulations. But a slap-dash approach to
privatization will also not do. Clear and transparent rules are needed. Arbitrary
decision-making by certain individuals (like minister, or director-general or
secretary) is an invitation to corruption. The Enron project in Maharashtra ran
into trouble because the negotiations and the terms of the deal were shrouded in
secrecy. Thirdly, corruption is caused by scarcity. When things required are in
short supply, people in power demand ‘consideration’ to ensure their regular
supply or increase their cost. This happens whenever there is high demand but
low supply of commodity of daily use like cement, sugar, oil, etc. Fourthly,
corruption is caused as well as increased because of the change in the value
system and ethical qualities of men who administer. The old ideals of morality,
service, honesty and sacriﬁce are regarded as an achronistic, and accepting
‘favours’ as a "need than a folly or an aberrant behaviour. Fifthly, corruption
can be traced to ineffective administrative organization. Lack of vigilance,
enormous powers to the ministerial staff, unaccountability, defective infor-
mation system, etc., give scope to ofﬁcials not only to be corrupt but remain
unaffected even after following corrupt practices.
</p>
<p>
	Causes of corruption can also be categorized as economic, Social,
political, legislative and judicial. The economic causes include: craze for higher
living standards, inﬂation, licence system, profiteering tendencies, and lack of
morality in business community. The social causes include: materialistic
outlook of life, erosion in social values, illiteracy, acquisitive cultural traits,
feudalistic hangover, peoples’ toleration, public indifference, and exploitive
social structure. The political causes include: political patronage, ineffective
political leadership, political apathy, political immorality, election funding,
nexus with politicians, and political sub—culture. The legislative factors are:
inadequate legislation, loopholes in law, and callousness in implementation of
laws. The judicial causes include: expensive judicial system, judicial indif-
ference, lack of commitment among judges, and frequent acquittals of the
accused on technical grounds.
</p>
<p>
	Thus, the most important factor responsible for corruption is the nature
of human being. People in general have a great thirst for luxuries and comforts
and as a result of which they get themselves involved in all unscrupulous activ-
ities that result in monetary or material benefit. Besides moral and spiritual

act of Corruption
</h1>
<p>
While talking of corruption, should we be concerned only with big financial
deals and scams, or types of corruption called political, bureaucratic, indus-
trial, institutional, etc., or we should also be concerned with those corruption
cases which remain invisible but pervade our daily life and corrode the very
fibre of our moral fabric. Some people feel that we should filter corruption
into various grades. While according to one view, ‘amount’ should be the
criterion  of corrupt act, according to other, ‘need’ should be the focus. A few
rupees spent to gain a major benefit is not worth bothering about. Yet another
view is that‘ price’ paid for the required‘ service’ is in order. Corruption
comes in only when the price is paid but for which no service has been done.
but what about adulteration 1n food or spurious drugs sold to us and things
like that? Generally, such cases in our daily life are not regarded as ‘corrup-
tion’ .Is cheating in an examination corruption? Is increasing marks in an
answer-book by an examiner on getting ‘recommendation’ from a colleague
or a frlend or a kin (but not by accepting money) corruption? In their defence,
examiners say that they only ‘oblige’ and how can ‘obligation’ be corruption?
many clerks go to the offices and sign the attendance registers but are never
found on their seats. They become ‘available’ only when they are offered
money for the file they move. This is corruption.
</p>
<p>
	Some people say that while corruption is found even in most developed
countries like the United States, Japan, England, France, Canada and
Germany, why should we unnecessarily get perturbed about it in India? These
people forget that nature of corruption in the developed countries is different
from the one we find in our own country. Corruption in these countries
exists only among the nighest echelons of business giants, while in India we
have to pay for the railway reservation, for getting admission not only 1n a
professional institution but even for a child 1n a good primary school, for
purchasing a gas cylinder, for driving the two-wheeler without a helmet, for
getting the arrear bill passed, for getting the tax refund, and so on. Thus, while
in other countries, money is paid for getting illegal things, in India it is paid
for getting legal and authorized things. And, this is really disturbing that the
corruption is now accepted as a normal course of interaction between the
citizen  and the public official. All these affect the day-to—day living of the
common man. As such, we have to be concerned with such corrupt acts too.
     We should not forget that cc ruption has affected our society in several
ways. (1) It has retarded economic development of the country. (2) It has

central and the state governments receiving financial aid, employees of the
University Grants Commission (UGC), vice-Chancellors, professors and
Scientists in institutions receiving financial aid from the central or state
governments or even from the local authorities have all been declared as
public servants. However, the MP5 and MLAs, even though performing
public duties’, have been kept out of the ambit of the Act. The Act covers all
the ‘corrupt’ acts as covered by the 1947 Act (bribe, misappropriation,
obtaining pecuniary advantage, possessing assets disproportionate to income,
etc.). The Act extends to whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir and
applies to all Indian citizens, whether living 1n the country or outside it.
       If the offence against the public servant is proved 1n the court, it is
punishable with imprisonment of not less than six months but extending to a
maximum period of five years. Six months imprisonment is thus mandatory
and the courts have no discretion in this regard. If public servant is found
committing offence habitually, he is to be punished with imprisonment of not
less than two years but not more than seven years, and also fine.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002
</h1>
<p>
	The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was enacted in January 2003.
The Act along with the rules framed thereunder have come into force with
effect from 1st July, 2005. The Act defines offence of money laundering as
whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or
knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property,
shall be guilty of offence of money laundering. It prescribes obligation on
banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries for verification
and maintenance of records of the identity of all its clients and also of all trans-
actions and for furnishing information of such transactions in prescribed form
to the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND). It also empowers the
Director of FIU-IND to impose fine on banking company, financial insti-
tution or intermediary if they or any of its officers fails to comply with the
provisions of the Act as indicated above.
     The Act empowers certain officers of the Directorate of Enforcement to
carry out investigations in cases involving offence of money laundering and
also to attach the property involved in money laundering. The Act envisages
setting  up of an adjudicating authority to exercise jurisdiction, power and
authority conferred by it essentially to confirm attachment or order confis-
cation of attached properties. It also envisages setting up of an appellate
tribunal to hear appeals against the order of the adjudicating authority and the
authorities like Director, FIU- IND.

	     The Act envisages designation of one or more courts of sessions as special
court(s) to try the offences punishable under the Act and offences with which
the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, be charged at
the same trial. The Act also allows Central Government to enter into an
agreement with government of any country outside India for enforcing the
provisions of the Act, exchange of information for the prevention of any
offence under the Act or under the corresponding law in force in that country
or investigation of cases relating to any offence under the Act.

	Besides, the recently enacted Right to Information Act, 2005 also contains
some provisions which can be used for containing corruption. Among its major
objectives are containing corruption, making public servants accountable by
empowering citizens to get information and improving transparency.

	    Following the massive public outcry since Anna Hazare's
anti-corruption campaign in 2010, the government has proposed tweaking the
laws. A Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013, which seek to
remedy some of the existing lacunae, 15 in the pipeline. It will reportedly
broaden the definition of bribery to include a middleman and make a
commercial entity liable for failing to prevent bribery of an official. If will also
fix a time-frame for prosecution (see Rajadhyaksha and Kably, ‘Not easy to

Central Vigilance Commission
</h1>
<p>
A Committee on Prevention of Corruption was appointed by the
government of India in 1960 under the chairmanship of K. Santhanam. This
committee gave its report in 1962. The recommendations pertained to various
aspects of corruption. It was on the basis of the recommendations of this
committee that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) was set up in 1964
for looking into the cases of corruption against the central government and
other employees. The CVC is a non-statutory body whose jurisdiction and
functions can be amended not by the parliament but by a government order,
It deals with cases of corruption against the gazetted officers of central
government, union territories, officers of PSUs, and nationalized banks. It is
independent of government and works as an autonomous body like the
Union Public Service Commission. Its role is merely advisory. It is a one-man
commission headed by the Central Vigilance Commissioner, assisted by a
Secretary, five Branch Officers and eleven Commissioners for Departmental
Inquiries (CDIs).
</p>
<p>
	The main functions of the CVC are: (1) to undertake an inquiry into any
complaint of corruption against a public servant; (2) to advise the disciplinary
authority about the type of proceedings to be initiated against: accused person

Commissions/Committees on Corruption of Politicians and Public
companies
</h1>
<p>
In the last forty years (i.e., between 1955 and 1997), more than two dozen
commissions have been appointed by the Government of India to inquire into
The charges of corruption against politicians and public companies. Of these,
nine commissions were appointed during the period 1963 to 1983 against the
chief Ministers of different states. These were: Das Commission against
sardar Pratap Singh Kairon, Chief Minister of Punjab (1963), Ayyangar
commission against Bakshi Gulam Mohmad, Chief Minister of Jammu and
Kashmir (1965), Khanna Commission against Biju Patnaik, Chief Minister of
Odisha (1967), Kapur Commission against Dayanand Bandodkar, Chief
minister of Goa (1968), Mudhokar Commission against V.K. Mahtab, Chief
minister of Assam (1968), Sarkaria Commission against M. Karunanidhi,
chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (1976), Grover Commission against Dev Raj
Urs, Chief Minister of Karnataka (1977), Vimada Lal Commission against
vengala Rao, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (1977), and Gurdev Singh
Commission against Zail Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab (1979).
</p>
<p>
	Five commissions appointed against the ministers were: Chagla
Commission (1956) against Union Finance Minister T.T. Krishnamachari (and
also Finance Secretary and Chairman of Life Insurance Corporation), Aiyer
Commission (1967) against five ministers of Bihar, Madholkar Commission
(1968) against thirteen ministers of Bihar, a Commission (1969) against R. K.
Kunju, in, minister in Kerala, and Reddy Commission (1977) against contracts
entered by Union Defence Minister, Bansilal.
</p>
<p>
	Five other commissions on charges of corruption were: Vaidyalingam
Commission (1979) on charges of corruption and wielding extra-constitutional
authority to interfere in government affairs against Kanti Desai, son of Morarji
Desai, and Gayatri Devi, wife of Charan Singh, Prime Minister of India,
Kailasam Sadasivan and Ray Commissions (1981) against spirit scandals in
Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Shankeranand Committee (1990) on corruption
charges in Bofors deal, and Jankiraman Committee (1992) on Security Scam.
     Corruption charges were recently levelled against two Chief Ministers of
Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (1995). The Governor of Tamil Nadu even
Permitted the Janata Party President in April 1995 to prosecute the then
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister for two out of 38 charges against her under the
prevention of Corruption Act. Of these two charges, one involved Rs 365
crore coal-import deal in August 1993 and the other related to the purchase of

a large plot of land from the state government for Rs 1. 82 crore When its
estimated market value was Rs 4. 27 crore. This Chief Minister had also been
accused of spending Rs 50 to Rs 100 crore on the wedding of her foster son in
September, 1995. Yet another Chief Minister who was charged in April 1995
for corrupt practices is a person who has been the Chief Minister of West
Bengal for more than 18 years. The charges were levelled by the former
Tripura Chief Minister and a veteran Marxist leader.

<p>
	The Vohra Committee was set up in July 1993 to study corruption in
India by taking stock of the links between government functionaries and
political personalities and crime syndicates and mafia organizations. the
Committee submitted its report in October 1993. The government had
shelved the report for 18 months but under the pressures of the opposition
parties in the parliament, the report was put in the two houses of parliament
in August 1995. The report has made a scathing commentary on the nexus
between politicians and criminals. It has stated that the “network of the mafia
is virtually running a parallel government pushing the state apparatus into
irrelevance”. The committee has even stated that some parliamentarians and
State Assembly members have come into political power through the
leadership of gangs and armed senas. The committee has recommended the
setting up of an agency to collate information from all agencies and take
immediate, effective and deterrent action against the crime syndicates,
smuggling gangs and economic lobbies in the country which have over the
years developed an extensive network of contacts with the government
functionaries and bureaucrats at the local levels and politicians and media
persons at the state and the central levels.

<p>
	Eighteen states in India (including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar,
Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan,
Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) have set up the institution of Lok Ayukta for
investigating charges of corruption against ministers, MLAs and other public
functionaries. There 18 no such institution as yet at the national level which
may act as a watchdog body on ministers’ probity, though in 1992 and again
in 1994, the then Prime Minister had promised that an institution like
Ombudsman in Sweden and a few other European countries will be estab-
lished by law at the central level. Lok Pal Bill was introduced in the
parliament for a number of times—in 1968, 1971, 1977, 1985, 1989, 1996, 1998,
2001, 2005 and 2008—for appointing the Lok Pal but it has not yet been
ratified. Recently, the present UPA-2 government, in December 2011, again
introduced the Lok Pal Bill in Lok Sabha, after the massive public outcry
following Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption campaign, but amid objections by
various political parties to bring the Prime Minister under its purview, it

could not so far see the light of day. The real hurdle in passage of the bill is the
lack of political will. There is no substitute for Lok Pal whose jurisdiction is to
be confined to investigation of the corruption charges against those holding
high offices, including the Prime Minister. Prosecution under the Prevention
of Corruption Act is possible only if the complainant gets government
permission which is seldom given for obvious reasons. No citizen can invoke
the Special Courts Act as long as the government does not agree that a prima
facie case calling for action exists. Both these handicaps will be absent in the
Lok Pal which can be moved by anyone to start a case by filling an affidavit.

<h1>
mbating Corruption
</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to contain corruption in our society? Most politicians when
come into power for the first time declare their determination to eradicate
corruption but soon they themselves become corrupt and start amassing huge
wealth. When Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1984, he too declared
war against corruption but soon he himself became the victim of Bofors
payoff scandal. Corruption today has thus come to be institutionalized.
    There are many myths about corruption which have to be exploded if
we really want to combat it. Some of these are: corruption has become a way
of life and nothing can be done about it; or that corruption is a
post-independence phenomenon and it is the result of giving too much
freedom and licence to the people in democracy; or that the poor people of
underdeveloped countries are generally dishonest and untrustworthy by
nature and easily tempted, while people of the developed countries are less
prone to corruption; or that corruption exists only at the lower and the subor-
dinate levels; or that corruption is found more among the illiterate than the
educated people; or that corruption spreads mainly because of politicians. All
these fallacies are too crude and we have to guard against them while planning
measures to contain corruption.
</p>
<p>
	 Some methods have been suggested for reducing corruption. These are:
One, we have to focus on law, procedure and administration. Laws and rules
pertaining to the organization and behaviour of persons in specific situations
with specific status are essential. ‘Bad’ laws/ rules have to be changed or
repealed. If the law/ rule is too harsh, complicated, and ambiguous, it leads to
corruption. Laws should not be such that they leave too much scope for
discretion. Discretion will have to be commensurate with the status of the
officer and the type of the role assigned to him. ‘Administrative’ factors
include both structural and functional aspects. How is an organization struc-
tured will determine the lacunae for corruption. ‘Functioning’ refers to the
'ongoing' process of working which refers both to the quantity and the
quality of work, supervision, magnitude of lapses permitted, and so on. Two,

hampers efficiency; on the contrary, it improves it. Suspect officials of
doubtful integrity should be kept away from sensitive posts. Surprise checks
should be carried out at vulnerable points of corruption. Four, liberalization
policy should be introduced very cautiously. Eventually, liberalization and
free market may reduce corruption but at present ‘liberal sanctions' are
granted in return for a ‘consideration’. Capitalist countries like the United
States, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are considered
to be enormously corrupt societies. In Japan, we frequently hear of
corruption scandals, pointing out the institutionalization of hypocrisy and
dishonesty. Five, expenses in elections have to be strictly controlled. Lastly,
cooperation of the people has to be obtained for successfully containing
corruption. We will elaborate the last two measures.
</p>
<p>
	Why are cases of corruption not reported by the people to the police? It
is because they are afraid (that the corrupt will harm them), indifferent (that it
is not their duty to reform the society) and pessimists (that the corrupt are
inﬂuential and powerful people and no action will be taken against them).
Yet, there are people who do try to bring corrupt cases to the notice of the
concerned authorities. These are the people who have a feeling of uneasiness,
who have a sense of guilt and who get comfort of mind for doing something
good for the community. Corruption is such a monster which can be
vanquished only by the collective efforts of the people. If they make sure that
the dishonest politicians do not get elected to legislatures, half the battle. is
won. But the big question is: will 1t ever happen?
</p>
<p>
	In a democratic country like India, will people ever realize that they
have to play a crucial role 1n combating evils like corruption? In fact, much of
the corruption exists because of people’s tolerance or complete lack of public
outcry against it, as well as the absence of a strong public forum to oppose it.
While many intellectual, educated, well-informed and articulate citizens
remain worried about this monstrous problem in the country, they fail to
channelize their resentment into strong public opinion against it. A concerted
effort by the responsible and enlightened citizens can surely make a serious
dent in the corruption level. Even our university youths can take up such
society-oriented goals and organize movements for curbing the evil.
</p>
<p>
	Yet other effective method of containing corruption could be to
introduce method which will enable political parties to secure electoral funds
in a bonafide manner, or the central government may fins. 1ce elections
through an election fund. This system is being followed in Germany, Norway
and Sweden and some advanced countries of Europe. The political. parties
may be funded by the state in accordance with the votes polled by them in the
previous general elections. The money may be fixed per vote, say two rupees
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page000537">537</pagenum>

<p>
per vote or so on. The idea of state funding of elections has been discussed in
our parliament more than once in recent years but not only the earlier
governments but even the present one feels that the government is strapped
for cash. But this does not appear to be true at all. In view of our huge annual
budget, it would hardly be 1—2 per cent of the total budget outlay. If the
government thinks that even this paltry sum cannot be set aside, an election
cess, like education cess, on the voters may be imposed. This state funding of
elections will no doubt reduce corruption to a large extent.
</p>
<p>
	 State funding of elections will not only eliminate contributions from
corrupt businessmen and interest groups but will also contribute to free and
fair elections, drawing men of integrity in assemblies, equalizing the amount
spent by various political parties, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
	   Besides the above measures, appointing Lok Pal to look into the charges
of corruption at the highest echelons of power, as stated earlier also, could
prove to be an effective measure in containing corruption. At present, Lok
Ayuktas in most states have been tendered impotent because of the numerous
disabilities. Learning from their experiences, the powers of the Lok Pal should
be widened. His recommendations should have a statutory force. These
should be tabled 1n parliament and duly publicized in the media. The Lok Pal
could comprise a single retired judge of the Supreme Court or two or three
judges. He/ they should be selected not by the executive but by a committee of
four persons consisting of the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India, Speaker
of the Lok Sabha, and the Leader of the Opposition. The Lok Pal should have
an independent investigative machinery at his disposal.
</p>
<p>
	A few more measures can be suggested to eradicate corruption from the
society. These are: (i) political commitment, (ii) administrative accountability;
(iii) procedural simplification; and (iv) civil society activism.
</p>
<p>
	It may be concluded that corruption today has ceased to shock people.
Even when malpractices are detected, the Ministers and officers go scot-free.
At the most, they are transferred. So long corruption fails to attract legal,
moral and social censures, there is no hope of eliminating or even reducing 1t.
it may not be possible to root out corruption completely at all levels but it is
certainly possible to roll it down or to contain it within the tolerable limits.
corruption is a cancer which every Indian must strive to obliterate. Honest
and dedicated persons in public life known for their honesty and integrity,
reduced government control in the economy, popularly called liberalization
policy, and Control over electoral expenses could be three most important
prescriptions for corruption. People have tolerated the corrupt persons for
long. It is now time that containing corruption is taken seriously by the
dedicated political rulers.

    The process of land alienation took place by imposing on tribal popula-
tions 1 systems of land tenure and revenue collection developed in advanced
areas the government unintentionally facilitated the transfer of tribal land to
members of other ethnic groups. The deterioration of the aboriginals’
position, which in many parts of Peninsular India began as early as the middle
of the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, occurred despite the
fact that many British officials sympathized with the tribesmen and some of
the most fervent advocates of tribal rights were found among the officers of
the Indian Civil Service. Yet, the recommendations for reforms contained in
numerous reports were seldom implemented in full, and even where they
were incorporated in legislation they did not always prove effective.
</p>
<p>
	Unable to resist the gradual alienation of their ancestral land, the
aboriginals of many regions either gave way by withdrawing further into hills
and tracts of marginal land or, if no such refuge areas were left, had no other
choice than to accept the economic status of tenants, sharecroppers, or agricul-
tural labourers on the very land their forefathers had owned.
</p>
<p>
	 There was only one part of British India where a policy of
non-interference and protection enabled the tribal populations to retain their
land as well as traditional lifestyle. In the hill regions of Northeast India which
enclose the Brahmaputra valley in the shape of an enormous horseshoe, tribes,
such as Nagas, Mishmis, Adis, Miris, Apa Tanis and Nishis, were the sole
inhabitants of a vast region of rugged mountains and narrow valleys into
which the peoples settled in the plains of Assam had never penetrated. A small
volume of barter trade between hills and plains was carried on by tribesmen
from the foothills, but most of the hill people never set foot in the
Brahmaputra valley. When in the second half of the 19th century and during
the first decades of the 20th century the British extended their administrative
control over part of the hill regions, they did not encourage the entry of
plainsmen, but devised a system of administration which allowed the hillmen
to run their affairs along traditional lines.
</p>
<p>
	As late as the 1930s the entire administration of the Naga Hills district,
for instance, was in the hands of one deputy commissioner stationed at
Kohima and one sub-divisional officer, whose headquarters was
Mokokchung. With the help of a few clerks and a small force of Assam Riﬂes,
these two officers maintained peace and order in a large hill region where
bridle paths were the only means of communications. No plainsman was
allowed to acquire land in the hills, and the indigenous system of land tenure
was retained virtually unchanged. This policy protected the hill people from
exploitation and land alienation.

<h1>
The Legislations
</h1>
<p>
The various orders passed from time to time with the view of ameliorating the
conditions of the tribal population of the East Godavari Agency Tract were
ultimately consolidated in legislation known as the Agency Tracts Interest
and Land Transfer Act, 1917. The regulation of this Act formed a model for
similar legislations in other tribal areas, and we shall therefore quote some of
its main sections. In order to save the tribals from the exploitation of money-
lenders, the Act laid down that (a) interest on any debt or liability shall not as
against a member of a hill tribe be allowed or decreed at a higher rate than 24
per cent per annum nor shall any compound interest or any collateral
advantage be allowed against him; and (b) the total interest allowed or decreed
on any debt or liability as against a member of a hill tribe shall not exceed the
principal amount.
</p>
<p>
	     Even more important were the sections restricting the transfer of land
from tribals to outsiders. The relevant section (4) contained the following
provisions:
Notwithstanding any rule of law or enactment to the contrary any
transfer of immovable property situated within the Agency tract by a
member of a hill tribe shall be absolutely null and void unless made in
favour of another member of a hill tribe or with the previous consent in
writing of the Agent or of any other prescribed officer. [Agent was the
revenue officer comparable to the collector of a normal district.]
Where a transfer of property is made in contravention of sub-section (1),
the Agent.... may on application by anyone interested decree ejectment
against any person in possession of the property claiming under the
transfer and may restore it to the transferor or his heirs.
It is only fair to admit, however, that in the period 1917—47 the
condition of the tribal populations in the East Godavari Agency Tract was
relatively favourable, and that the massive invasion of tribal land by outsiders
occurred only after 1947.
</p>
<p>
	 The need for special protection of aboriginal tribes was not confined to
the areas notified as Agencies, and in 1919 an Act known as the Government
of India Act, 1919, provided that “the Governor-General in Council may
declare any territory in British India to be a ‘Backward Tract’ and that any act
of the Indian Legislature should apply to such Backward Tracts only if the
Governor-General so directed.”
    The legislation of 1919 was a forerunner of the Government of India
Act, 1935 and the Government of India (Excluded and Partially Excluded
Areas) Order, 1936. ‘Excluded areas’ were backward regions inhabited by
tribal populations to which Acts of the Dominion Legislature or of the
</p>

<p>
provincial legislatures were to apply only with the consent of the governor of
the province. The intention of this provision was to prevent the extension of
legislation designed for advanced areas to backward areas where primitive
tribes may be adversely affected by laws unsuitable to their special conditions,
Though at the time Indian nationalists saw in it a device to retain British
control over selected areas, after the attainment of independence
Government of India adopted a somewhat similar policy 1n regard to several
territories on the North East Frontier.
</p>
<p>
	The Indian Constitution of 1950 also provided for the notification of
Scheduled Tribes (STs) and their protection by a special legislation. Regarding
the administration of the scheduled areas the governor of each state which
includes a scheduled area is bound to submit a report to the President of india
annually or whenever required. The states periodically prepare lists of STs,
and these have to be confirmed by parliament. As STs in receipt of various
benefits, there has been considerable pressure from backward classes for
inclusion 1n this list, and as late as 1977 new additions were proposed by
various states and confirmed by parliament.
</p>
<p>
	The National Tribal Policy (NTP), first proposed 1n 2004 by the NDA
government, met with much opposition from civil society for adopting an
assimilationist approach. It was criticized for trying to include tribal people
with mainstream population, thus violating their rights and diluting their
distinctiveness. It was also frowned upon for being a stand- alone document,
not factoring in other applicable laws like the Panchayat Extension to
Scheduled Areas Act or the Land Acquisition Act and instead loosely
speaking about measures like land rights, without any actual commitment.
     In 2006, soon after the UPA government came to power, the Ministry of
Tribal Affairs drafted a fresh policy. The draft handled the ‘assimilation’ issues
that were diluting their unique identity and, instead, used an approach of
‘integration. For example, 1n Northeast India, over a 100 tribal ethnic minor-
ities are dependent on shifting cultivation. Half of Meghalaya’ s population,
the Khasi tribes in particular, practise this method of farming for survival
While the 2004 draft coerced them to give up this ‘primitive’ method,
pointing out that the tribes ‘do not seem to have any emotional attachment to
land as an asset’, the current draft approaches this issue realistically by
acknowledging that it is the only possible farming practice in interior areas
that, in fact, promotes collective ownership of natural resources. While the
2004 draft makes vague suggestions like ‘encouraging qualified tribal doctors
to serve tribal areas,’ the new draft proposes integrating indigenous and
modern medicine for the tribal population. Such changes make the 2006 draft
realistically address contemporary tribal issues such as evictions from forests,

<p>
ebtedness and conﬂict and unrest, which were earlier never addressed. Yet,
drawback it suffers from the most is the lack of any action points or a
use bound strategy to act upon.
  The draft was placed before the union cabinet on May 31, 2007 for
approval, following which it was referred to a group of ministers (GoM). In
the recent parliament session, Tushar Chaudhary, the Union Ministe1 of State
the tribal Affairs, confirmed that the GoM has now forwarded the final draft
on the cabinet for approval. A speedy approval now depends on the political
commitment of the new UPA government, which apparently scheduled the
approval of the NTP as a priority in its postvictory promises.
</p>
<p>
	what then is the significance of a NTP in the Indian context? Since
independence, the major policy initiatives with regard to tribes have been
Nehru’s outlined ‘Panchsheel’ (a five pointer guideline to develop a tribal
policy) and constitutional provisions protecting STs. Various laws and
schemes regarding different aspects of STs were formulated, each ambiguous
and contradicting the other. This has deepened the sense of exclusion and
alienation of adiwsis in India, which has been manifesting itself in the form of
tribal unrest. The emergence of Naxalism in Chhattisgarh a,nd more recently,
in lalgarh, has been capitalising on this very same tribal discontent. Previous
UPA government’s Tribal Affairs Minister P.R. Kyndiah observed, “It is a
paradox that the poor tribals are living in areas which are rich in minerals,
forest resources and other natural bounties. The solution lies in giving rights
to the ST communities over natural and financial resources, addressing
economic deprivation.”
</p>
<p>
	But what has been the space for STs themselves in the process of creating
this landmark policy? The adivasi organizations and activists across the
country were given 20 days (21 July-10 August 2006) to provide comments
and feedback on the draft policy. V.K. Srivastav, Professor, University of
Delhi, explains why the draft may not give confidence to the tribal people:
"the dynamic reality of tribal living is missing in the draft. It lacks the ‘tribal
’voice’. Throughout the text runs the ‘we-they’ distinction — what ‘we’ think
tribes should be given.” To counter this essential shortcoming, a series of
national and regional consultations with adivasi organizations and
community groups should be sought before its approval.
</p>
<p>
	In the wide range of current political debates in India lies a core question:
Who is a ‘Scheduled Tribe’? With the many ambiguities regarding the nature
of the term, any comprehensive policy on the STs should have had an authori-
tative clarification on this term. However, the NTP merely points out the
outdated and derogatory nature of criteria used for scheduling tribes so far —
"primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000546">546</pagenum>

<p>
and backwardness”. The policy needs to outline new criteria from the
perspective of deprivation and exclusion.
    In the transient state of globalization, the adivasis in the country are
faced with new aspirations and problems and so the choice to retain or rebuild
their cultural and political identities should be left to them. Sharad Joshi,
former member of the Rajya Sabha and leader of the Shetkari Sanghatana,
observes: “A National Tribal Policy should be based on the principle of
freedom for every tribal society to opt for either the old lifestyle or to go
the modern life, or choose access to both lifestyles.” India, along with 143
member-state nations of the UN, adopted the Declaration on the Rights of
the Indigenous Peoples in September 2007. Article 3 of the Declaration states:
“Indigenous peoples have the right to selfdetermination. By virtue of that
right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development.” And yet, the NTP is far from
proposing the right to self-determination to help tribal communities choose
their path of development as their fundamental right.
</p>
<p>
	While the policy 18 a remarkable attempt to capture a holistic view of the
contemporary tribal situation in the country, the extreme delay in approving
the policy, its inability to ﬁx concrete goals, and the lack of a participatory
approach render it inadequate. For the UPA government to live up to its
promise of empowering the ‘aam aadmi’, the voice of India’s tribes must be
heard loud and clear before it is tabled to reﬂect a truly national policy.
</p>
<h1>
Causes for the Tribal Unrest
</h1>
<p>
Following are the main causes for tribal unrest:
1. Laws and tribals: The provisions laid down by the Constitution have
rarely provided justice to the tribals. This holds good with almost all
laws -— forest, ﬁrst, revenue, excise, criminal or civil laws - which have
basically two major lacunae: they have snatched away the tribal rights
over land, forest and resources, and secondly, they have failed to
recognize the traditional legal system and management practices of the
tribals with regard to either resources or to the social systems. Even laws
which are protective of tribal interests have not been implemented with
earnestness as a result of which land alienation prevails as the most
serious problem until today. The ignorance and docility of tribal people
in confronting the exploitation of non-tribals has shifted to gradual
awareness of laws and assertion of their rights.
2.Development policies of the government. If one traces the historical process
on development intervention by the government in the tribal areas, he
can perceive a very illogical, insincere and shortsighted attempt at
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000547">547</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:547
</h1>
<p>
defining ‘development’ in the hill regions. Government policies have
always been in contravention of the laws of the scheduled areas and
there was little respect paid to the implementation of these laws.
Moreover, the abundant resources of land, water or forests have been
utilized for the benefit of external societies and people but never was
there development of the local communities. Further, they have only
been displaced, at times more than once and never or meagrely compen-
sated for their loss of resources Or livelihoods. This is true of irrigation,
drinking water, electricity or any other development projects.
3.The present policies of the government are to violate, circumvent or
amend the laws which protect the interests of the poor tribals, falling
4 over backwards to help private companies or industries commercially
prosper, like mining industries, tourism, paper mills, film or wood-based
industries. The experience with such unscrupulous development policies
of the government is spurning the tribals, especially the youth, into the
tantalizing calls of extremist exhortations.
</p>
<p>
Non-tribal nature of all development activities: The underlying non-tribal
nature of any development approach is a serious factor to reckon with.
Non-tribals dominating the government machinery in the tribal areas
not only feel bitter about the various welfare programmes designed for
tribals, but also get into an exploitative relationship with the local
traders, contractors and police. This results in very few benefits actually
reaching the tribals. While tribals revere the natural resources as life
sustaining forces, the non-tribals outlook is one of utilitarian and
short-term commercial exploitation. This disregard for tribal-nature
symbiosis is causing not only a threat to tribal survival but is also leading
to depletion of resources in the tribal regions.
The ignorance of tribals has given advantage to the ﬂourish of trade and
business by non-tribals who hold the reins of the economic and political
powers in the tribal region and the functioning of the government
machinery. Whether directly or indirectly they have total control over
the lands and resources of the tribals. This suppression of rights through
the nexus with the politicians and police has emboldened the tribals to
strike back with the aid of extremist forces of whom they are again
victims of.
</p>
<p>
Attitudes and prejudices: The officials and employees of the government
posted in tribal areas approach the tribals with all the prejudices of
non-tribal society. The tribals are considered uncouth savages, steeped in
crude superstitions and rituals due to their ignorance of external mecha-
nisms of life. Their culture and social systems are looked down upon and
</p>






















<pagenum page="normal" id="page000548">548</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:548
</h1>
<p>
it is with condescension that they relate to tribals when they visit the
tribal villages. There is anger among the tribals at this ill-treatment
which is now showing itself 1n various forms of protest.
Ineffective development programmes: There is a discernible lack of
concentration on addressing the basic 1ssues of the tribals on the part of
the government administration. Many programmes implemented for
the tribals look into the peripheral needs of the people and display
apathy towards the primary causes of unrest, mainly land alienation and
land-related problems. Tribals being inseparably bonded to land and
forest face serious problems with non-tribals and the in regaining their
control over their lands. The present administration chooses to ignore
this aspect.
</p>
<h1>
Possible Remedies
</h1>
<p>
Depressing as it is, there is scope for setting straight the disturbing situation of
the tribal region What is necessary is the genuine interest of the governemt
in making a serious effort at remedying the causes of unrest. Some factors
which could be looked into are:
A sensitive administration: The government has to recognize that the
tribal people have a distinct socio-cultural structure and the adminis-
tration has to understand and respect these systems while designing and
implementing development programmes. Programmes should be
sympathetic to tribal needs addressing the real issues and conflicts. It
should be emphasized that the machinery should work without social
and political biases towards tribal communities. For instance, any
conﬂicts or disturbances that arise between tribals and non-tribals should
dealt by the police, revenue and other officials with anti-tribal and
pro-non—tribal stand.
More powers to the people. Governance of tribal areas cannot undertaken
with the same method adopted in the plans. Conﬂicts of customary laws
versus universal laws, conflicts over control over resources and
tribal-non—tribal disputes in the tribal areas all over the country have led
to the formulation of the New Panchayati Raj Act which lays emphasis
on the local self— —governance and empowering the Gram Sabha in
scheduled areas. The state governments should, in all sincerity,
implement this Act without any dilutions.
Balanced development policies. The state governments should follow a
people -friendly development policy with regard to any programmes or
projects planned in the tribal areas. It should first consider the social and
economic progress of the local communities in the overall development
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000549">549</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:549
</h1>
<p>
planning in the region instead of displacing people, destroying their
livelihoods and taking up only an apparent development.
Inconsistencies in laws and policies: The existing inconsistencies in the
constitutional laws and the changing trends in the policies of the state
govenments, which are in violation of the protective laws, are causing
unequal and discriminative programmes with regard to tribal commu-
nities. If clarity in laws and implementing policies are followed, there
would not be necessity for people and organizations to question the
projects of the government.
Education: Ignorance and illiteracy of tribals are the basic problems to
any development. Government should also take it up as a thrust activity
to bring literacy and education to the tribals. Government institutions
like ITDA have a responsibility to make the tribals aware of their laws
and programmes so that education in all aspects is achieved.
</p>
<h1>
Impact of Extremism on Development Activities
</h1>
<p>
Tribal areas were totally closed and neglected by the government till the insur-
gence of extremist forces who have the credit of making the government focus
its attention on the development of tribal areas and in improving the condi-
tions of the tribals. It is as a result of militant movement that government set
up welfare institutions like ITDA, and brought administrative remedies like
single line administration, special deputy collectors, etc. and brought about
the land Transfer Regulations Act of 1970. Extremism in this sense has been
very beneficial to tribals and gave relief to some of their problems. The land
issues resolved by the government were also a result of this pressure from the
extremist forces.
</p>
<p>
	Interestingly, the latest developments in the strategies of the extremists
seem to have a populist and welfarist approach while so far it has been a
political and social movement. Today, the extremists are declaring that they
would assist the tribals in activities like providing credit and banking facilities,
medical aid, irrigation and agricultural programmes, etc. They are also encour-
aging the people to regenerate forests but with species specified by them. It has
to be observed what impacts this parallel development approach from the
underground would have on the tribals and the government. However, it is
seen that some of the divisions of the Naxalite groups are dealing with the
tribal situation arbitrarily the repercussions of which have to be taken note of
by the larger society.

Bonded Labour
</h1>
<p>
A man keeping another man in perpetual bondage for his selfish and personal
objectives is the type of man’ s cruelty to man which is not confined to a
particular country or a particular region but 18 found as a global phenomenon
for hundreds of years, right from the Biblical days to the present era. The first
Global Slavery Index, published by the Australia-based Walk free
Foundation, ranked India on the top with 13.9 million modern slaves out of a
total of 26 million in the world. Modern slavery includes traditional slaves
those in debt bondage, forced labour or forced marriage, kids sold and victims
of trafﬁcking. According to International Labour Organization (ILO)
estimates of 2013, over 21 million people across the world are trapped as
forced labour. Today, the ILO estimates a minimum 11.7 million in forced
labour in the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of whom are in debt bondage
However, the nomenclature changed from period to period and place to
place: slave, serf, villein, and bonded labour. In India, this type of exploitation
of man by man has remained prevalent in the name of begar and ryot for years
The term ‘bonded labour’ or bandhua mazdoor is of recent origin. Bonded
labour IS prohibited 1n India by law vide Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution
tution. A specific law to prohibit this practice was legislated in 1976 known as
the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act. Despite the statutory profit
bition, bonded labour is widely practised in India. Lakhs of bonded labourer
continue to be exploited and carry the yoke of neglect, suffering and
frustration in abject silence. In fact, the system of bonded labour, as prevalent
in Indian society, is a relic of feudal hierarchical society. A considerable
interest has come to be shown in the bonded labour during the past three

and human rights. Not only adult males and females but children as well are
ondemned to be suffering under this bondage.

<h1>
The Concept
</h1>
<p>
For developing a conceptual framework, we have to understand two terms:
bonded labour system’ and ‘bonded labour’. The ‘bonded labour system’
refers to the relationship between a creditor and a debtor who obtains loan
wing to economic compulsions confronting his day-to-day life and agrees to
abide by the terms dictated by the creditor. The important term of the
agreement is that the debtor agrees to mortgage his services or the services of
any or all the members of his family for a specified or unspecified period. The
relationship built on the agreement is on such unequal terms that while for
every labour or service, there must be some fair remuneration equivalent to
the price of labour in the market, under the bonded labour system, the service
rendered for the debt or in lieu of the interest accruing to the debt. The
lebtor either works without receiving any remuneration or if at all there is
any remuneratlon it is much less than the minimum wage (notified under the
minimum Wages Act) or the prevailing rate of market wage.
</p>
<p>
     The 1976 Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act defines ‘bonded labour
system’ as the system of forced labour under which a debtor enters into an
agreement with the creditor that he would render service to him either by
himself or through any member of his family or any person dependent on
Him, for a specified or unspecified period, either without wages or for
nominal wages, in consideration of loan or any other economic consider-
tion obtained by him or any of his ascendants, or in pursuance of any social
obligation, or in pursuance of any obligation devolving on him by
accession. The agreement has other consequences too, such as, forfeiting
the debtor the freedom of employment, denial of freedom of movement in
any part of the country, and denial of the right to sell at market value any of
as property or product of his labour.
</p>
<p>
	The term ‘bonded labour’ has been defined by the National
commission on Labour as “labour which remains in bondage for a specific
period for the debt incurred”. The Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and
scheduled Tribes explained the term ‘bonded labour’ in its 24th report as
persons who are forced to work for the creditors for the loan incurred either
thout wage or on nominal wage” (Sharma, 1990: 52).
   The ‘bonded labour’ is different from‘ contract labour’ employed in
industries, mines, plantations, docks, etc. The contract labour includes
</p>

</h1>
<p>
workers who are not directly recruited by the establishment, whose names
do not appear on the pay roll, and who are not paid wages directly by the
employer. In theory, the contract labourers in India are covered by the
Factory Act, 1948, the Mines Act, 1952, the Plantations Labour act, 1951
and the Dock Workers Act, 1948 so as to give them benefits as are admissible
to labour directly employed. However, the advantages of employing both
bonded labour and contract labour are the same: (i) the labour is engaged at
the lower cost, (ii) the employers have not to extend the fringe benefits to
the workers, and (iii) the employers are not under any obligation of
providing welfare and security measures to the workers as stipulated in
various Acts. The system of contract labour in our country was, however,
abolished in September 1970 by an Act called Contract Labour (Regulation
and Abolition) Act.
</p>
<p>
	The two basic features of bonded labour are: indebtedness and forced
labour. The forced labour can hereditarily descend from father to son or be
passed on for generations together. During the period of bondage, the debtor
cannot seek employment from any other person. In economic terms, this
means that he cannot “sell his labour in the market at market value". The
bonded labour system is mostly found among agricultural laboures in
villages, though today it has extended to workers working in stone quarries,
brick kilns, bidi factories, glass factories fire works factories, textile and carpet
factories, gem stones factories, etc. Large number of women and children are
employed as bonded labour in these non-farming sectors. In cities, children
are employed as bonded labour in restaurants or often end up being employed
as bonded beggars or fall prey to sex trade.
</p>
<p>
	The bonded labourers are known by different names in different parts of
India. For example, in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, they are known as
‘]eetbams’, in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh as ‘Halis’, in Bastar distric in
Madhya Pradesh as ‘Kabadis’, in Hyderabad as ‘Bhagela’, in Rajasthan as
‘Sagris’, in Bihar as ‘Kamias’ or ‘Kamiantis’, in Odisha as ‘Gotbees’, in Tamil
Nadu as ‘Pandiyals’, in Kerala as ‘Adiyas’, ‘Paniyas’ and ‘Kattunai/eens’ and is
Uttar Pradesh as ‘Koltas’. According to a few recent systematic surveys
non-agricultural sector now has a very significant number of bonded
labourers. Following types of bonded labour continue to be significant:
bonded labour that is a vestige of traditional social relations; (b) bonde
labour in agriculture, (c) bonded labour in the rural and urban unorganized
and informal sector; and (d) child bonded labour.

<p>
the main causes of origin, growth and perpetuation of bonded labour
are economic but the social and religious factors too support the
The economic causes include: extreme poverty of the people, inability
and work for livelihood, inadequate size of the landholdings to support
lack of alternative small-scale loans for the rural and urban poor,
calamities like drought, ﬂoods, etc., destruction of the standing crops,
and other diseases leading to death of men and animals, absence of
drying away of wells, meagre income-from forest produce, and inﬂation
constant rising prices. The social factors include: high expenses on
occasions like marriage, death, feast, birth of a child, etc., leading to heavy
caste-based discrimination, lack of concrete social welfare scheme to
safeguard against hunger and illness, non-compulsory and unequal educational
system, and indifference and corruption among government officials. Some
times, the exploitation by some persons in the village also compels people to
migrate to some other place and seek not only employment on the employer’s
conditions but also get protection from the influential persons. The religious
arguments are used to convince the people of low castes that religion enjoins
upon them to serve people of high castes. Illiteracy, ignorance, immaturity
and laCk of skill and professional training sustain such beliefs. Broadly
speaking, it may be maintained that bondage originates mainly from
economic and social pressures (Sharma, 1990: 52).
</p>
<h1>
The legislation
</h1>
<p>
The pernicious and fastidious practice of bonded labour existed in many states
in India. After independence, it could not be allowed to continue to blight the
national life any longer. As such, when the Constitution of India was framed,
article 23 was enshrined in it which prohibited ‘traffic in human beings’,
begar and other similar forms of forced labour. However, no serious effort
was made to give effect to this constitutional provision and stamp out the
shocking practice of bonded labour. The Forced Labour (Abolition)
convention adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1919
was ratified by India only in November 1954. Some states in India had also
enacted laws for abolishing the bonded labour. For example, the Bihar
Kamianti Act was passed in 1920, the Madras Agency Debt Bondage
Regulation in 1940, Kabadi System Regulation in Bastar in Madhya Pradesh in
1943, Hyderabad Bhagela Agreement Regulation in 1943, Odisha Debt
Bonded Abolition Regulation in 1948, Rajasthan Sagri System Abolition Act
in 1961 (which was amended in 1975), and Kerala Bonded Labour System .
(Abolition) Act, in 1975. But it was only after the announcement of the

<p>
20-point programme on July 1,1975 that the legislative exercise at the
national level began with some amount of seriousness and urgency. An
ordinance was enacted in October 1975 which was later replaced by the
Act passed 1n February 1976, called the Bonded Labour System (Abolition)
Act. With this all the state laws became inoperative after the enactment of
the Act by the union government in 1976.
</p>
<p>
	The Act implies: (i) identification of bonded labourers; (ii) release of
bonded labourers; (iii) action against offenders, 1. e., creditors who had forced
agreement upon the debtor, (iv) holding of regular meetings of the vilgance
committees at the district and tehsil level, (V) maintenance of the precribed
registers; and (Vi) conferring of judicial powers to executive magistrates. the
Act also provides for the rehabilitation of the bonded labourers who are freed
from their creditors. The 1976 Act was amended in 1985 in which it was
clarified that the contract workers and interstate migrant workers, if they
fulfil the conditions laid down in the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act,
1976, will be considered as bonded labour.
</p>
<p>
	The main problem that 15 faced 1n the implementation of the 1976 Act is
the identification of the bonded labourers. Neither the administrators at the
district and tehsil levels admit the existence of the bonded labourers in their
areas nor the creditors accept that any bonded workers are serving them, nor
the workers themselves "are willing to give statements that they are being
forced to work as bonded labourers since long. It is the social workers
attached to non-political social action groups and voluntary organizations
who identify the bonded labourers. The other handicap which aggravates the
problem is the economic rehabilitation of the released labourers. The
economic rehabilitation includes: ﬁnding jobs for them, getting them
minimum wages, giving them training in skills, horticulture, animzl
husbandry, etc, promoting their traditional arts and crafts, allotment of
agricultural land, helping them in developing the allotted land, helping them
in getting the raw material, providing them either land for constructing
houses or low-cost dwelling units, arranging bank loans or credit for them
helping them in the processing of forest produce, educating them and their
children, arranging for their medical care, etc. All these are herculean tasks
Besides ensuring the economic rehabilitation, the state governments are also
expected to arrange for their psychological rehabilitation and integration
various schemes of central and state governments. In chalking out plans an
strategies of rehabilitation, the freed labourers are to be given the choice
between various alternatives (Sharma, 1990: 54).

ncy and Suffering in Bondage
</h1>
<p>
former Chief Justice of India Justice P.N. Bhagwati described the bonded
bourers as “non-beings, exiles of civilization living a life worse than that of
animals, for the animals are at least free to roam about as they like and they
as plunder or grab food whenever they are hungry, but these outcastes of
society are held 1n bondage and robbed of their freedom even. They are
confined to an existence where they have to live either 1n hovels or under the
open sky and be satisfied with whatever unwholesome food they can manage
to get, inadequate though it may be to fill their hungry stomachs. Not having
any choice, they are driven by poverty and hunger into a life of bondage, a
dark bottomless pit from which, in a cruel exploitative society, they cannot
hope to be rescued” (Yojdnd, May 1—15, 1987: 32-33).
</p>
<p>
	The 32nd round of National Sample Survey Organization (N 380) gave
an estimate of 3,43,000 bonded labourers in 16 major states. Of these, 98 per
cent are said to be bonded due to indebtedness and 2 per cent due to
customary social obligations. The highest number is believed to exist in three
states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, followed by Odisha,
uttar Pradesh Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. A Human Rights Watch report
from 2003 estimates that 3, 50,000 children work as bonded labour 1n silk
thread and weaving industry in the Karnataka and Varanasi districts alone. In
tamil Nadu,1 no meaningful effort has been taken to wipe out bonded labour
in the state due to the misconception that only stray case of it exists. But, the
truth  is that it is prevalent very much and 1n many forms like Sumdngdli
Thittam. The Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority (TNSLSA) has
launched a special programme to weed out bonded labour 1n the state (7796
Times of India, Madurai, 7 August 2013). The secretaries of the District Legal
services Authorities (DLSAs) have been directed to form a core group called
District Taskforce for Bonded Labourer (DTBL) to achieve the purpose. The
DTBL, ﬁrst of its kind 1n the country, will consist of a judicial officer of the
rank of junior division civil judge, tWo panel lawyers, an NGO member who
works on the abolition and rehabilitation of bonded labour, an official
nominated by the district collector (not below the rank of tahsildar), one or
two para-legal volunteers and local panchayat chairman/ member. The DTBL
team will collect information about the prevalence of bonded labour system
in their respective districts, and thereafter prepare a plan for the rescue, release
and rehabilitation of the bonded workers.
</p>
<p>
	In states like Kerala, where land reforms have been implemented by
statute, bonded labour has been virtually eliminated. It has been pointed out
that the majority of the bonded labourers work as agricultural labourers in
villages and belong to the outcaste or tribal communities. Of the total labour

<p>
the 37 years since the Act was passed (Business Standard, 31 May 2013). These
data are based on the number of bonded labourers who have been able to avail
of government beneﬁts after procuring release certificates. This may,
however, be an underestimate as the data do not include the actual number of
people rescued from bondage since many are unable to produce the necessary
documents. But this uncertainty only underlines the fact that  accurate
estimates of bonded labour are hard to establish, so the current government's
claims to having abolished it are decidedly weak on this score. The
Government of India’s unique scheme of MGNREGA which guarantees 100
days of paid labour in a year has played an important role in securing the
stability of rural workers. But to say bonded labour has been eradicated
through a government scheme is to misunderstand the basic concept. by
deﬁnition, bonded labourers are denied freedom to leave their place of work
and are not allowed to work elsewhere by employers for a variety of
reasons—past debts being a key one. As a result, they are cut off from access to
state or central government benefits and schemes, such as the MGNREGA”, to
which they are entitled. They simply do not have the freedom to engage in
such schemes. The first step in any plan to effectively address the issue of
bonded labour must be a concerted effort to ensure their freedom through a
robust identification system and official release. It is only once bonded
labourers are free that schemes such as the MGNREGA and other
government welfare programmes can be converged and made easily accessible
to promote the intended benefits to the vulnerable community.
    Table 1 bel presents the number of bonded labourers identified in
the 1996 surveys, and those subsequently identified and rehabilitated till 31
March 2004:

   Rehabilitation is both physical and psychological. Physical rehabili-
tation is essentially economic whereas psychological rehabilitation has to be
built up through a process of assurance and reassurance. The two must go side
by side. The ﬁrst prerequisite of psychological rehabilitation is that the freed
bonded labourers must be wrenched away from the old habitat and be rehabil—
itated at a place where they will no longer be subject to the ruinous inﬂuence
of the erstwhile bonded labour-keepers. Unless they are psychologically
assured that after release from bondage, debt will not regulate their destiny
any longer, there is every possibility that they may slide back to debt bondage.
     Basically, there are three phases of rehabilitation: (i) immediate physical
subistence after release; (ii) short-term measures to help the freed workers to
start a new life (for example, allotment of a house site, assistance for
construction of a house, allotment of a plot of agricultural land, supplying a
pair of bullocks and agricultural implements, or provision of avenues of
gainful employment, etc.;) and (iii) long-term measures (such as, arranging
credit, training in new skills, developing existing skills, providing a remuner-
ative price support, ensuring non-formal literacy of adult members and formal
literacy for children, securing medical care, protection of civil rights etc) It 18
thus the rehabilitation which will give the freed bonded labourers the status of
beings so that they may be able to identify themselves with the mainstream of
a civilized human society and realize the dignity worthy of human existence.

	In 1994-95, a voluntary organization—Action for Community Organi-
zation, Rehabilitation and Development (ACCORD)—helped five tribes in
the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu (Paniyas, Bettakurumbas, Kattunaickens,
Motukurumbas and Irulas) in getting them freed from the agony of bondage
and land deprivation (The Hindustan Times, May 13, 1995). It took it ten years
of toil to bring about this change. The tribals, many in slavery since the 18th

and the 19th centuries, had become bonded labourers after slavery was
abolished. During the annual Onam festival, the landlords would ﬁx yearly
bondage for the tribals who would get paddy and two sets of clothes along
with few basic things. The ACCORD helped the tribal tea plantation growers
not only in getting loans but also in forming a Sangam with the participation
of about 20,000 tribals to foster the concept of tribal unity. This Sangam has
reduced their sufferings, protected them from exploitation of bondage, helped
them in asserting their rights, and establishing schools, health centres,
hospitals, etc.
</p>
<p>
	Thousands of migrant workers come to Tamil Nadu each year in search
of employment. Impoverished, illiterate and bereft of choice, many end up
becoming indentured workers in rice mills, brick kilns and manufacturing
units. According to an NCO-International Justice Mission—2,452 individuals
and 737 families have been rescued from bonded labour in the districts of
Kancheepuram, Vellore, Tiruvallur, Chitoor and Tiruvannamalai since 2008.
</p>
<h1>
Lacunae in Effective Rehabilitation
</h1>
<p>
	Qualitatively reviewing the implementation of the rehabilitative programmes
for the bonded labourers in different states, we find that some states, like
Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, point out the welcome
features of identification and rehabilitation but some need to introduce .many
innovative changes. The following visible lacunae 1n the implementation of
the programme need to be dealt with immediately.
</p>
<p>
       First, instead of treating the programme in isolation as the programme of
a particular ministry/ department there has to be coordination among various
concerned ministries/ departments like those of agriculture, animal
husbandry, irrigation, forest, fisheries, etc., so that the programme is dealt
with as an integrated national programme. Second, since the social milieu and
the social structures which promoted the bonded labour system in the past
continue to dominate the village life and the economy even today, they need
to be probed into and changed with commitment. Third, the development
departments are so much burdened with schemes like MNREGS, etc., that
their programmes mostly remain time-bound and target-oriented without
taking into account the needs, aptitudes and preferences of the beneficiaries.
The need is, therefore, to design programmes in such a manner that they serve
as target group-oriented rather than target-oriented. Fourth, with poor infra-
structure and lack of qualified and committed staff and resources, the
beneficiaries are not provided protective covers on a long-term basis with the
result that very often productive assets turn into liabilities. Fifth middlemen
operate like parasites and take away the limited fruits and benefits of

to succumb to pressure tactics. We have to tell the exploiters that law cannot
be circumvented and has to take 1ts course in democratic India. We have to
create committed opinion among the masses. We have to involve not only
intellectuals but also the enlightened citizens to carry the message to these
who matter. We have to enforce laws rigidly. We have also to impress upon
the politicians to tackle the issue with concerted interest and a missionary
zeal. The system based on exploitation by a few socially and economically
powerful persons, trading on the misery and suffering of large numbers of
men, and holding them in a bondage constitutes a shameful feature of our
national life. The bondage of the economically impoverished segment of
society for a small debt is totally incompatible with the egalitarian
socio-economic order promised to Indians. Wiping out this system is basic
and crucial to human dignity and conformity to constitutional values.

Agrarian Distress and
Farmers’ Suicides
</h1>
<p>
India is an agrarian economy with around two-third of its working
Population depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. Though the
share of agriculture and allied sector in the country’s GDP has declined
steadily over the years—51.9 per cent in 1950—51 to 13.7 per cent in 2012-13—it
is still the largest sector and plays an important role in the overall
socio-economic development of the country (Economic Times, August 30,
2013) India could achieve the self-sufficiency in the production of food grains
only in a few decades of its political emancipation. The food production in the
country reached to more than 257 million tonnes in 2011-12 from only 52
million tonnes in 1951-52.
</p>
<p>
     The recent crisis in agriculture sector in India is mainly the result of the
marginalization of agrarian economy in national policy since the initiation of
economic reforms in the 19905. Besides, farmers’ indebtedness is also the main
cause of distress in the agriculture sector. According to a survey conducted by
National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), as part of its 59th round, nearly
half of India’s farmers are in debt. Of the 89. 35 million rural households
engaged in farming in India, nearly 43. 42 million or 48. 6 per cent run into debt.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, poor returns to cultivation and absence of non-farm opportu-
nities are also indicative of the larger socio-economic malaise 1n rural India.
According to Srijit Mishra (2007), the features of the current agrarian crisis are
briefly elaborated as follows:
     First, there has been a decline in the growth rate of production as well
as product1v1ty for almost all crops from the m1d-n1net1es. Further, the
value of output from agriculture has been declining from late nineties.
</p>










<pagenum page="normal" id="page000566">566</pagenum>

<p>
Second, there is an excessive dependence of a large section of the
population on agriculture (in 2004-05 nearly 64% of the rural persons
were from households whose members’ major activity status was
either self- employed in agriculture or agricultural labour). This also
indicates that rural non-farm employment opportunities are limited.
Third, the declining size- c-lass of holding and an increasing person-
derance of marginal holdings (63% as per 2000-01 agricultural census),
along with poor returns from cultivation, indicates that income for
farm households is very low.
Fourth, the much talked about green revolution had a greater focus
on rice and wheat under irrigated condition bypassing crops and
regions under rainfed or dry land conditions (which is three- fifths of
the 141 million hectares of net sown area in the country during
2003-04). There has been a failure to capitalize on the vast network of
institutions to provide and regulate new technology (including the
usage of biotechnology), and a virtual absence of extension service.
Fifth, the neglect of agriculture in plan resource allocation has led to a
decline in public investments in irrigation and other related infra-
structure.
Sixth, supply of credit from formal sources to the agricultural sector
is inadequate leading to greater reliance on informal sources at higher
interest burden.
Last, but not the least, with changing technology and market condi-
tions, the farmer is increasingly being exposed to the uncertainties of
the product as well as markets.

<h1>
Farmers’ Suicides
</h1>
<p>
Farmers’ suicides in India became the centre of considerable concern in the
19905 when a Hindu’s journalist P. Sainath first highlighted the large number
of suicides among them. The first state where suicides were reported was
Maharashtra. Soon newspapers began to report similar incidents from Andhra
Pradesh. Official reports initially denied it but as more and more cases came to
light the government began to accept that farmers in India were under consid-
erable stress.
</p>
<p>
	 In the beginning it was believed that most of the suicides were happening
among the cotton growers, especially those from Vidarbha. A look at the
figures given by the State Crime Records Bureau, however, was sufficient to
indiate that it was not only the cotton farmers but farmers as a professional
category were suffering, irrespective of their holding size. Moreover, it was
not only the farmers from Vidarbha but all over Maharashtra which showed a
</p>

<p>
significantly high suicide rate. More than 17,500 farmers a year killed
the themselves between 2002 and 2006, according to government statistics.
    Besides Maharashtra, the other states where most suicides occurred were
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Punjab. According to the National
Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2006, the state of Maharashtra, with 4,453
farmers’ suicides, accounted for over a quarter of the all-India total of 17,060.
NCRB also stated that there were at least 16,196 farmers’suicides in India in
2008, bringing the total since 1997 to 1,99,132. According to government data,
over 5,000 farmers committed suicide between 2005 and 2009 in Maharashtra,
while 1,313 cases were reported by Andhra Pradesh between 2005 and 2007.
In Karnataka, the number stood at 1,003, since 2005-06 till August 2009.
According to NCRB database, the number of suicides during 2005-2009 in
Gujarat was 387, whereas in Kerala it was 905, in Punjab 75 and in Tamil
Nadu 26. In April 2009, the state of Chhattisgarh reported 1,500 farmers
committed suicide due to debt and crop failure. At least 17,368 Indian farmers
killed themselves in 2009 - the worst figure for farm suicides in six years.
</p>
<h1>
Causes
</h1>
<p>
Research by various scholars identified a variety of reasons for farmers’
suicides in the country. The agricultural indebtedness has been cited as the
most important reason for this. The drying up of institutional credit and
exploitative informal credit trap in the face of rising costs and declining profit-
ability have led to pervasive indebtedness among farmers. The Situation
Assessment Survey of Farmers in the 59th round of NSSO 1n 2003 revealed
that nearly half the farmers in the country were indebted. The incidence was
higher in states with input-intensive agriculture like Punjab, Haryana,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, and was highest at 82 per
cent in Andhra Pradesh.
</p>
<p>
	 K. Nagaraj of Madras Institute of Development Studies points out that
"from the mid— 90s onwards prices and farm incomes crashed. As costs
rose-even as bank credit dried up—so did indebtedness. Even as subsidies for
corporate farmers in the west rose, we cut our few, very minimal life supports
and subsidies to our own farmers. The collapse of investment in agriculture
also meant it was and is most difficult to get out of this trap” (cited in Sangalad
and Hudder, 2011). A. Vaidyanathan (2006, cited in ibid.) too states that
farmers’ suicides are associated with high level of indebtedness.
</p>
<p>
	According to activist and physicist Vandana Shiva (voltairenet.org, 23
May 2009), rapid increase in indebtedness is at the root of farmers’ taking their
lives. Debt is a reflection of a negative economy. Two factors have trans-
formed agriculture from a positive economy into a negative economy for
peasants: the rising of costs of production and the falling prices of farm

commodities. Both these factors are rooted in the policies of trade liberal-
ization and corporate globalization. Shiva further writes that the factors that
have caused 2,00,000 suicides in India are rooted in the policies of trade liberal-
ization and corporate globalization which ensnare farmers in a spiral of
indebtedness, generating despair.
</h1>
<p>
	Contrarily, according to Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission,
indebtedness is not the only cause of suicides among farmers, but at least 20-25
compelling reasons too have been driving hundreds of farmers in Madhya
Pradesh to kill themselves (Times of India, December 11, 2011). In another
study of Punjab by Satyanarayana and Sanjay (2014), it was revealed that debt
per se is not a sufficient condition for the suicides, but the processes of
recovery of debt and the normative support and egoistic tendencies are found
as some of the sufficient conditions. Actually, the phenomenon of suicides
among cultivators is such a complex one that it is very dificult to point out
one particular reason for this.
</p>
<p>
	Aruna Burte, Sangeeta Rege and Padma Deosthali (2008, cited in
Sangalad and Hudder, 2011) opine that the farmers are unable to cope up With
the sudden changes in cropping patterns, market fluctuations and use of pesti-
cides to increase the yield. These are direct results of agricultural policy driven
by market forces. When the crops fail, they are in debt, which they have no
means to repay. They are not able to perform the role of provider for the
family. All these factors are to be taken into consideration while under-
standing an individual farmer committing suicide.
</p>
<p>
	Emphasizing the importance of joint family, R. S. Deshpande (2002,
cited in ibid.) asserts that 1n joint family system each member was secure. The
joint families in olden days were extending moral support to their members at
the time of crises. The majority of victims who committed suicides were
surprisingly came from nuclear families. Even Durkheim in his monumental
contribution ‘La Suicide’ speaks of the co-relationship that exists between
family size and incidence of suicides. According to him, there exists an
“inverse relationship between family size and tendency towards suicides”.
Durkheim (1952: 355) writes: “A person is almost certainly well insured
morally when isolated and left to himself than when constantly under benef-
icent discipline of family surroundings”. Deshpande (op.cit.) also feels that
failure of social institutions to instil and establish confidence among those
who are on the verge of breakdown is one of the main factors responsible for
the suicides among farmers.
</p>
<p>
	Sangalad and Hudder (2011), in their paper, have also pointed out the
failure of crops, increasing prices, financial stress, unwillingness to adopt
scientific farming practices, mental illness and depression, scarcity of water
and electricity, etc., as the contributory factors for suicides by farmers.

are continuously coming from different states. Actually, the systematic risks
in agriculture are qualitatively and quantitatively different today than a few
decades ago. Increasing commercialization and heavy investments in inputs
added technology and credit risks to the traditional weather risk. To this liber-
alization added market risks. All these have been accentuated by receding state
support since the nineties. Public investment in agriculture, institutional
credit, research and extension services, a rationalized marketing structure and
healthy rural development expenditure, which are all essential to overcome
these risks, have declined since the nineties. The Planning Commission itself
acknowledged a perceptible stagnation in the fortunes of the agricultural
sector during the post-liberalization period, and much of the distress that the
farmer faces today is demonstrably due to deliberate policy changes that the
economic reforms entailed (Posani, 2009).
</p>
<p>
	Some scholars and experts have also suggested measures to effectively
bring down the suicides among farming community. According to Vandana
Shiva, for 1nstance, the strategies to prevent farmers to suicide may include a
shift from GMC) and non-renewable seeds to organic, open pollinated seed
varieties which farmers can save and share, from chemical farming to organic
farming, and from unfair trade based on false prices to fair trade based on real
and just prices. And, the farmers who have made this shift are earning 10 times
more than the farmers growing Monsanto’s Bt-cotton. Similarly, Srijit Mishra
(2007) 13 of the view that risk mitigation strategies should go beyond credit.
Long-term strategies require more stable 1ncome from agriculture, and more
importantly, from non-farm sources. Private credit and 1nput markets need to
be regulated. A challenge for the technological and financial gurus is to
provide 1nnovative products that reduce costs while 1ncreasing returns. The
institutional vacuum of organizing farmers needs to be addressed through a
federation of self— help groups (SHGs) or alternative structures.
</p>
<p>
	Sangalad and Huddar (2011) have suggested the following measures:
Farmers Counselling Centres should be established at the Mandal
Panchayat level with the appointment of trained staff comprising a
social worker, psychologist, agricultural scientist, doctor and elected
representative of Mandal Panchayat.
Proper training should be imparted to the farmers by agricultural
experts regarding use of pesticides and fertilizers.
Awareness should be created among farmers regarding scientific
farming of different crops to get better yield and good price for their
products.
An Advisory Council should be formed for the prevention of
farmers’ suicides both at the district and state levels to advise and
supervise the members of the Counselling Centres.
</p>

It should be made mandatory to the college level NSS units to
organize camps in the villages and create awareness in the farming
community about the effect of suicide and its impact on other
members of the family.
Encourage the farmers to adopt the allied activities like dairy, poultry
etc. along with farming activities.
Encouragement of networks of relatives, friends, neighbours and
members of the faith community to decrease isolation, which is one
of the strongest risk factors for suicides.
To conclude, it can be stated that the policy implication from the above
discussion calls for an emphasis on the larger crisis. However, the trend can be
reversed through active participation of the governmental institutions in
addressing the real issues of the farmers that are driving them to suicides.
Social responsibility or the involvement of civil society can also go a long way
to help the farmers.

Black Money
</h1>
<p>
In the past few years the public discourse on the issue of black money has
come in the forefront. Black money is both an economic and a social
problem. While in the latter context, it is perceived as a problem with adverse
sociological effects on society, like social inequalities, social deprivations, etc;
in the former context, it is perceived as a parallel economy, an underground
economy or an unofficial economy that is the consequence of the economic
policies of the government and has damaging effects on country’s economy
and nation’s socialist planning development. While problem like poverty
affects those people who are poor, unemployment affects those who are
unemployed, alcoholism and drug abuse affect those who consume them,
black money is a problem which does not affect those who possess it but the
common man in society. No wonder, it has been described as a problem with
a difference.
</p>
<h1>
The Concept
</h1>
<p>
Black money is tax-evaded income. It can be earned both through legal and
illegal means. Its legitimate source is that the income-earners do not reveal
their whole income for tax purposes. For example government doctors
earning money by private practice even when they get non-practising
allowance, teachers earning money through tuitions, examinations and book
royalty and not including it in income tax returns, adVocates charging much
higher fee than shown in their account books, and so forth. Its illegitimate
source is bribe, smuggling, black marketing, selling commodities at prices
higher than the controlled prices, taking pugree for house, shop, etc., selling
</p>

<p>
	house at a high premium price but showing it at a much lower price in the
account books, and so forth.
     It is possible to convert black money into white money and Vice versa.
for example, when a person manages to get the receipt from the shopkeeper
by paying the sales tax for a commodity but does not purchase it actually, he
generates black money as reimbursement is made to him against the receipt.
The money not actually paid is the black money in such a case. In such case,
the shopkeeper sells the same commodity to another person without giving
him any receipt for it. On the other hand, if a person purchases something
(say, a TV or an AC, etc.) and pays Rs 35,000 for it out of white money but
gets a receipt of only Rs 30,000, the balance of Rs 5,000 becomes black money
for the seller. In this case, the white money becomes the black money.
</p>
<h1>
Magnitude of Prevalence
</h1>
<p>
	It is not easy to calculate the magnitude of black money in any society. The
economists across the world adopted different measures but could not .
estimate the amount involved in black money. Norway and Sweden used
questionnaire method for eliciting answers from persons whether they had
participated in illegal activities as buyers or sellers. Italy attempted to estimate
the underground economy by finding out the difference between the size of
the labour force officially reported and actually employed. This enabled to
determine the productivity in the underground sector. The United Kingdom
tried to assess parallel economy by comparing the official estimates of the
Gross National Product (GNP) made from the consumption side with those
made from the 1ncome side. In the United States, Guttman assumed that only
cash is used 1n illegal transactions. He tried to find out the difference between
currency required for economic transactions in a fixed period and actual
currency held outside banks in the same period.
</p>
<p>
	    In India, the estimates of black money made so far have followed two
distinct approaches, viz., (i) N. Kaldor’s approach of quantifying non-salary
incomes above the exemption limit of income tax; and (ii) the Edgar Feige’s
method of working out the transaction income on the basis of
currency-deposit ratio and deriving from it the ‘black’ income of the
economy Kaldor in his report (1956) estimated non-salary 1ncome on the
basis of the break-up of national income into: (i) wages and salaries, (ii) income
of the self-employed, and (iii) profit, interest, rent, etc. Excluding wages and
salaries from the contribution to net domestic product, he derived total
non-salary income. An estimate of the actual non-salary income assessed to tax
was made for each sector in order to arrive at the total non-salary income
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page000574">574</pagenum>

<p>
assessed to tax. The difference between the estimated non-salary income above
the exemption limit and the actual non-salary income assessed to tax measures
the size of ‘black’ income.
</p>
<p>
	The Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee (Wanchoo Committee) followed
the method adopted by Kaldor with some modifications. It estimated
assessable non-salary income for the year 1961—62 at Rs 2,686 crore, and
non-salary income actually assessed to tax to be of the order of Rs 1,875 crore.
Accordingly, the income which escaped income tax was of the order of Rs 811
crore. After making rough adjustments for exemptions and deductions, the
Wanchoo Committee found that ‘the estimated income on which tax has
been evaded (black income) would probably be Rs 700 crore and Rs 1000
crore for the years 1961—62 and 1965—66 respectively. Projecting this estimate
further to 1968—69 on the basis of percentage increase in national income from
1961—62 to 1968— 69, the income on which tax was evaded for 1968-69 was
estimated as Rs 1,800 crore.
</p>
<p>
	D. K. Rangnekar, a member of the Wanchoo Committee, dissented from
the estimates made by the Wanchoo Committee. According to him,
tax—evaded income for 1961-62 was of the order of Rs 1,150 crore as compared
to the Wanchoo Committee’s estimate of Rs 811 crore. For 1965-66, it was Rs
2, 350 crore against the Rs 1,000 crore estimated by the Wanchoo Committee
The projections for 1968—69 and 1969—70 were Rs 2,833 crore and Rs 3,080
crore respectively.
</p>
<p>
	Noted economist O.P. Chopra prepared a series of estimates of
unaccounted income for a period of 17 years, i.e., 1960—61 to 1976—77. His
methodology marked a significant departure from the Wanchoo Committee
approach and, as a consequence, he found a larger divergence in the two series
from 1973 onwards when income above the exemption limit registered signif-
icant increase. Chopra’s study estimated unaccounted income to have
increased from Rs 916 crore in 1960-61, i.e., 6.5 per cent of gross national
product (GNP) at factor cost, to Rs 8,098 crore in 1976—77 (11.4% GNP).
</p>
<p>
	The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) conducted
a study under the guidance of S. Acharya (1985). The study, however, gave a
broader definition of ‘black’ income and called it ‘unaccounted income’ for
purposes of clarity.
</p>
<p>
	While preparing the estimate of ‘black’ income, the study excluded
incomes generated through illegal activities like smuggling, black market
transactions, and acceptance of bribes and kickbacks.
      After aggregating the different components of ‘black’ income the study
quantified the extent of ‘black’ money for different years as shown in Table 1.
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000575">575</pagenum>

<h1>

</h1>
<p>
	The NIPFP study concluded that total black income generation of Rs
36,784 crore out of a total GDP at factor cost of Rs 1,73,420 crore was on the
higher side, although it turns out to be less than 30 per cent of GDP as against
some extravagant estimates placing it at 50 or even 100 per cent of GDP. The
study suggested with some degree of confidence that black income generation
in the Indian economy in 1983—84 was not less than18 per cent of GDP at
factor cost or 16 per cent of GDP at market prices.
</p>
<p>
	While the NIPFP report estimated the ‘black’ economy (not counting
smuggling and illegal activities) at about 20 per cent of the GDP for the year
1980—81, Suraj B. Gupta, a noted economist, pointed out some erroneous
assumptions in NIPFP study and estimated ‘black’ income at 42 per cent of
GDP for the year 1980—81 and 51 per cent for the year 1987—88. Arun Kumar
pointed out certain defects in Gupta’s method as well as in the NIPFP study.
He estimated ‘black’ income to be about 35 per cent for the year 1990—91 and
40 per cent for the year 1995-96.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000576">576</pagenum>

   The last official study for estimating black money generation was
conducted at the behest of the Ministry of Finance by the NIPFP in 1985. The
alternative estimates of ‘black’ income for the decade prior to 1985, complied
in the NIPFP report, as shown in Table2 ,show the extent of variation in
estimates (Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of
India, White Paper on Black Money, May 2012).
<p>
	   Of late, the Government of India had asked three think tanks—National
Institute of Public Finance and Policy, National Institute of Financial
Management and National Council of Applied Economic Research—to arrive
at an estimate of black money in the country. The three used various method-
ologies and have given new estimates—the first since 1985. Accordingly,
India’s black could be as high as 30 per cent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), indicating the size of the parallel economy could be about Rs 28 lakh
crore (Business Standard, January 13, 2013).
</p>
<h1>
Estimates of Black Money Stashed Abroad
</h1>
<p>
It may be useful to see how India compares with other countries in the world
on estimates of black money or black or shadow economy. The World Bank
Development Research Group on Poverty and Inequality and Europe and
Central Asia Region Human Development Economics Unit 1n July 2010
estimated ‘shadow economies ’of 162 countries from 1999 to 2007. It reported
that the weighted average size of the shadow economy (as a percentage of ‘ofﬁ-
cial’ GDP) of these 162 countries in 2007 was 31 per cent as compared to 34
per cent in 1999. For India, these figures were 20.7 per cent and 23.2 per cent
respectively, comparing favourably with the world average. Shadow
economy, for the purposes of the study, was defined to include all
market-based legal production of goods and services that are deliberately
concealed from public authorities for any of the following reasons:
° to avoid payment of income, value added or other taxes,
° to avoid payment of social security contributions,
to avoid having to meet certain legal labour market standards, such as
minimum wages,
° maximum working hours, and safety standards; and
to avoid complying with certain administrative procedures, such as
completing statistical questionnaires or other administrative forms.
</p>
<p>
	As in the case of total size of black money, there are many
scholars/ studies which have estimated the extent of black money of Indians
stashed away in Swiss banks using different methods and have also arrived at
different figures of black money even for the same year. There have also been
media reports in recent years that have extended several estimates of black
</p>

<p>
	Similarly, the total voluntary payments during investigations were to
the tune of Rs 374. 42 crore during 2009— 10.
      The FERA violations of around Rs 300 crore by a top company (ITC)
out the nexus between politicians and big business and the emergence of black
money in the country.
</p>
<p>
	In a survey conducted in 1996 by World Economic Forum of 200 business
executives from 49 countries in the world on specified index of corruption, in
tax evasion India was ranked 40 (i. e., as dishonest) and corporates ensuring
honesty were ranked 46 (India Today, November 30, 1996: 97).
</p>
<p>
	If rates of income tax are further reduced, there 18 more likelihood of
hiding less and thereby increasing the revenue. This was demonstrated in
1993—94 when the maximum rate of income tax was lowered to 40 per cent.
Besides, fixing a reasonable tax amount for shopkeepers and the other
self-employed also resulted in greater tax collection as more people willingly
entered into the tax net.
</p>
<h1>
Different Rates of Excise Duty
</h1>
<p>
Within similar products, there are different rates of excise duty. For instance, in
textiles and cigarettes, this leads to tax evasion through misclassiﬁcation of output
In textiles, separate rates of excise are charged for cloth of different varieties.
Manufacturers regularly downgrade a product to pay lower rates of excise, which
generates huge black money. The search and seizure operations have revealed
manufacturing to be a big tax evader with 200 per cent jump in 2008—09, just
behind real estate, indicating that the sector may have acquired a bigger play in
the black or the cash economy. Not just direct taxes, the manufacturing sector
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000579">579</pagenum>

<h1>

<p>
has also been on the radar for excise evasion. Excise duties. Excise duties have not
grown at the same rate as the growth in sector. Excise collection had peaked at Rs
1.23 lakh crore and are budgeted at Rs 1.06 lakh crore is 2009-10. In contrast,
manufacturing has grown at over 9 per cent in the four years to 2007-08 (The
Economic Times, 17 November 2009). This is just an example to show how varia-
tions in tax rates help in generating black money.
</p>
<h1>
Control Policy
</h1>
<p>
Another cause of black money is the price control policy of the government.
in selecting commodities for control and in determining their prices, the
government fails to take into account the elasticities involved in demand and
supply. For example, according to the report of the National Council of
Applied Economic Research (NCAER) for the year 1981, black money worth
Rs 840 crore was created in the Indian economy over the period of nine years
from 1965—66 to 1974—75 as a result of the operation of price controls in six
commodities Viz., cement, steel, paper, vanaspati, automobile tyres and fertil-
izers. Similarly, as a result of control on sugar, about Rs 400 crore of black
money were generated in the year 1991—92. Regulation of foreign exchange
also leads to over-invoicing of imports and under-invoicing of exports and
black-marketing of currency. Thus, the more stringent the measures of
control and the more regulated an economy, the greater will be the effort to
Violate it, which will increase hoarding, fraud, artificial scarcity and the
resultant black money.
</p>
<h1>
Quota System
</h1>
<p>
Yet another source of black money is the quota system. The import quota,
the export quota and the foreign exchange quota are generally misused by
selling them at a premium. Unrealistic controls spawn a culture which
encourage corporates to break the tax laws, particularly FERA laws. When
the government came out with a scheme a few years ago (1992-93) to allow
exporters to import goods without paying any customs duty, ingenious ways
were devised to make money even out of this scheme, i.e., the way of
over-invoicing exports to get more import benefits as well as avail of the tax
setoffs given to exports. During 1992—96, the Directorate of Revenue Intelli-
gence (DRI) and the customs authorities detected 605 such cases. One export
house (Ganpati Exports) benefited as much as Rs 85 crore (India Today,
November 30, 1996).
</p>
<h1>

<p>
Black money is also caused by scarcity and defective public distribution
system. When essential goods become scarce, people have to pay higher than
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000580">580</pagenum>


<h1>
Page no:580
</h1>
<p>
the controlled prices, which generates black money. The scarcity of cooking
gas, cement, kerosene, sugar, refined oil, etc. for example, 1n the part, have
always resulted in illegitimate transactions and black money.
</p>
<h1>
Inﬂation
</h1>
<p>
The increase in prices of commodities like petrol, etc. in international market,
increase in prices of commodities due to high increase in duties and taxes
imposed by the government, the conspicuous consumption created by people
with unaccountable money, diverting resources from production to specu-
lation—all these cause inflation which 1n turn creates black money.
</p>
<h1>
Elections and Political Funding
</h1>
<p>
Each election in the country involves lakhs of crores of rupees. In the present
times, for contesting Lok Sabha election, a candidate normally spends more
than five crore rupees and for Vidhan Sabha election, more than one crore. It
is estimated that a single Lok Sabha election alone could see political parties
spend around Rs 10,000 crore to pay for poll expenses. Politicians also need to
draw on business resources to nurse their constituencies. Given the
mind— boggling numbers, black money naturally is built into the system. For
funding politicians, even honest corporate houses have no option but to find
ways to generate unaccounted for money. Since the expenditure allowed by
law for a candidate lS limited and the companies are allowed to give up to 5 per
cent of their profit in a year as donations to political parties for elections (as
per Section 293A of the Companies Act, 1956), the elections are generally
financed by the black money holders. These people expect political patronage
and economic concessions which are obtained with the consent and the
connivance of political elite in power in the form of artificial controls on
commodities, laxity in the means of distribution, etc. All these methods
generate black money.
</p>
<h1>
Real Estate Transactions
</h1>
<p>
Real estate transactions are always seen as a big generator of black money as
transaction values are depressed to evade stamp duty and also absorb cash
This is largely the reason why the maximum number of evasion cases relates
to this sector—123 in 2008-09 (Wye Economic Times, 17 November 2009).
</p>
<p>
	    In these days, due to rising prices, purchasing a house and/ or land in
considered to be very profitable. There is a growing tendency of transforming
the rural agricultural land to urban residential land due to the paucity
building sites in the urban areas. Establishing unapproved colonies on agricul
tural land is illegal. The transaction value shown by the colonizers in

ration deeds is much less than the actual amount or the market value.
part, enables the seller of the land to evade capital gain tax. The high rates of
up duty—ranging between 14.5 per cent and 28 per cent in different
—is a major cause for under-valuation of property and unreported deals,
both. The suggestion is that if duties are reduced to 2 per cent to 3 per cent,
prevent evasion. Another hurdle is the Urban Land Ceiling Act, which
and  the supply of land and creates a black market.
</p>
<p>
	According to Wikipedia, the real estate sector in India constitutes about
per cent of its GDP. bout a third of India’s black money transactions are
achieved to be in real estate sector. The proposed Real Estate Bill, it is hoped,
all go a long way in checking the huge flow of black money into this sector.
</p>
<h1>
privatization
</h1>
<p>
Privatization has opened up a new area to the private sector as well as to politi-
tions and bureaucrats for making black money. One recent example is the
allotment of 2G spectrum by the Ministry of Communication in which the
minister concerned rode roughshod over departmental colleagues to give
contracts to favoured companies. Likewise, through the allotment of coal
mines, many ministers, including PMO, have been accused of having made
huge black money. It is expected that many scams will come to light for
making black money through privatization.
</p>

<h1>
Agricultural Income
</h1>
The unwillingness of the governments to bring agricultural income in the
ambit of income tax has also contributed to generation of black money. Big
industrial houses, over the past few decades, have entered the agriculture
sector in a big way by acquiring large farms, growing and producing nothing.
The black money accrued from other sources is sought to be converted into
white by showing it on the agricultural income account. Taxing agricultural
income may help contain this phenomenon.
<h1>
Social Effects
</h1>
<p>
Besides the economic effects, there are many social consequences of black
money also. In economic terms, black money robs the exchequer of its due
share, increases economic inequality and hampers programmes of economic
development. Socially, it increases social inequality, creates frustrations
among honest people, increases crimes like smuggling, bribery, etc. and
adversely affects social service programmes for the uplift of the poor and the
weaker sections of society. It also distorts the measurement of true rates like
growth rate, inflationary rate, unemployment rate, poverty, etc. which in
turn affects the government policies for containing these problems.

<h1>
Measures of Control
</h1>
<p>
Over the past 60 years, the government has at various times announced
several schemes offering opportunities to bring black money overboard. Some
of these schemes are: introducing the scheme of special bearer bonds, demone-
tizing high denomination currency notes, stringent raids, and scheme of
voluntary disclosures. In July 1991, the Union Finance Minister proposed a
new scheme—National Housing Bank Scheme—to woo black money black
into the legitimate operations of the national economy. The scheme offered
possessors of unaccounted for money an opportunity to deposit any amount
of money (with a minimum limit of Rs 10,000) with NHB without disclosing
the source of funds. It permitted the account holders facility to withdraw 60
per cent of their deposits from the account while the remaining 40 per cent
were impounded to be used for projects such as slum clearance and housing
for the poor. The withdrawals were to be made after stating the purpose for
which the money was proposed to be used. These people were taxed at the
rate of 40 per cent while the balance amount was channeled back into the
open economy. In 1997—98 budget, amnesty has been proposed for legiti-
mizing the black money by payment of 30 per cent as tax.
</p>
<p>
	The demonetization of 1,000 rupee notes in 1978 brought out currency
worth Rs 29 crore. Similarly, voluntary disclosure schemes of 1951,1955 and
1975 yielded Rs 249 crore of disclosed account. The disclosure scheme
launched in 1986 brought in just Rs 67 crore. The 1991 scheme yielded hardly
Rs 50 crore.
</p>
<p>
	Some scholars have maintained that all these measures have touched
only the tip of the iceberg. All the schemes have hardly fetched Rs 5,000 crore
over a period of fifty years after independence. The main drawback in these
schemes is that they touch the problem of black money already created but
they do not go into the root cause of generation of black money and that is
why a person is prepared to take the risk of keeping black money despite so
many problems. Unless this problem is tackled, the menace of black money
will continue to increase.
</p>
<p>
	It has been suggested that the problem of black money and parallel
economy can be contained by reducing taxes in some areas, giving incentives
for voluntary disclosure of income, overhauling the economic intelligence
unit, curbing administrative corruption at various levels, exempting tax on
money spent on house construction, doing away with control policies, and so
forth. Isolated attempts may not yield much but a package of mutually
reinforcing measures along with a strong political will and the commitment of
political elite may prove to be successful to a large extent.

	Recently, the government announced its five-pronged strategy to deal
the problem of black money. A study was commissioned by the
government, after a gap of 25 years, to estimate the quantum of black money
made and outside the country. Law enforcement agencies have investigated
general high-profile corruption cases, putting an unprecedented number of
persons charged of offences behind bars. A committee was constituted to
examine ways to strengthen laws to curb the generation of black money in
media, its illegal transfer abroad and its recovery. The Directorate of Income
tax, Criminal Investigation, was notified to deal with criminal matters having
financial implications punishable as an offence under any direct tax law. Joint
Drafting Committee was formed by the government, with representatives of
agitating civil society members, to draft a Lok Pal Bill. The bill has already
been introduced in parliament, debated and put to vote in its special session.
India ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption
(UNCAC). Decision was taken to triple the manpower of the Directorate of
Enforcement, responsible for implementing the anti-money laundering law.
These responses demonstrate government’s resolve to tackle the twin issues of
corruption and black money.
