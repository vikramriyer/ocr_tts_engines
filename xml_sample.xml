A.G. MOHAN AND DR. GANESH MOHAN

The
primary
goal of
classical
] yoga is'

to bring
concentration and stillness to
the mind. A focused mind and a
peaceful and positive feeling
. are vital requirements as well
as by-products of an effective
asana practice. Yoga should not
be for the body alone. Mental
focus as part of asana practice
is an entrée to the meditation
that follows the asanas. With-
out mental focus, asanas are
just an exercise for the body;
the mind is disengaged and
vagrant.

Such an asana practice will
not effectively lead to medita-
tion. Practising the true aim of
yoga — to calm and control the
mind — does not require a
knowledge of Sanskrit. Being
familiar with many Sanskrit
names, such as those for yoga
postures does not, in and of it-
self, indicate that a person is
practising authentic yoga.
Proper understanding of the
principles and practice of yoga
is more important. The funda-
mentals of the practice of yoga
came to us many centuries. ago
in the Sanskrit language. But
the methods and beneﬁts of the
practice transcend language
and culture.



Naming asanas

This raises the issue of nam-
ing asanas in order to practise
them. The Caraka Samhita -
the classical work on Ayurveda
(traditional Indian medicine) —
advises. the healer not to des-
pair if a name cannot be as-
signed to every disorder en-
countered; treatment can still
be administered. As yoga prac-
titioners and teachers, we can
follow this advice: “We do not
have to name each of the nume-
rous variations of classical asa-
nas, in Sanskrit or in any other
language, to practise them.”

Many variations of asanas
are easier practised or de-
